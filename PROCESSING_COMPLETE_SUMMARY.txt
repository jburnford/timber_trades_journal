================================================================================

PIPELINE EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY
-------------------------------

Step 1: Parse OCR Files ✓
  - Input: 1,866 OCR text files (gemini_full/)
  - Output: 74,894 shipment records
  - Format: Multi-page context-aware parsing
  
Step 2: Deduplicate LLM Hallucinations ✓
  - Input: 74,894 records
  - Duplicates removed: 5,928 (7.9%)
  - Output: 68,966 unique shipments
  - Major issue: Carl XV. from Oresund (1,409 duplicates)
  
Step 3: Generate Two CSV Files ✓
  - Shipments: 68,966 records
  - Cargo items: 104,839 records
  - Average: 1.5 cargo items per ship
  
Step 4: Apply Port Normalization ✓
  - Review decisions applied: 108 completed ports
  - Origin ports normalized: 15,531 ships (22.5%)
    - Human-mapped: 6,382 ships
    - Human-accepted: 2,639 ships  
    - Auto-normalized: 6,510 ships
  - Destination ports normalized: 62,325 ships (90.6%)
    - Human-mapped: 13,440 ships
    - Auto-normalized: 48,885 ships
    - Errors removed: 387 ships

FINAL OUTPUT FILES

DATASET STATISTICS
------------------

Temporal Coverage: 1876-1900 (21 years, 25 years of data)
Total Shipments: 68,966 unique ship arrivals
Total Cargo Items: 104,839 commodity records
OCR Success Rate: 96.9% (2,015/2,080 pages)
Processing Time: 33.9 hours OCR + parsing/normalization

Port Normalization Coverage:
  - 78,856 ships have normalized ports (either origin or destination)
  - 22.5% of origin ports normalized
  - 90.6% of destination ports normalized

KNOWN ISSUES ADDRESSED
----------------------

1. ✓ LLM OCR duplication (5,928 duplicates removed)
2. ✓ Port normalization applied (108 human-reviewed mappings)
3. ✓ Encoding issues fixed (latin-1/cp1252 support added)
4. ✓ Deduplicated data used as base for all analysis

REMAINING WORK (OPTIONAL)
--------------------------

Additional Port Review:
  - Can review more ports for improved normalization coverage
  - Current coverage is good for most analyses
  - High-priority ports (≥100 ships each) can be reviewed for maximum impact

See: final_output/authority_normalized/ports_for_review.csv

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT
------------------------

Based on 1883 validation study (1,769 matched pairs):
  - Port accuracy: 94% exact matches
  - Commodity accuracy: 93% exact matches
  - Unit accuracy: 97% exact/similar
  - Quantity accuracy: 37.6% exact, 44.3% within 10%

Recommendation: Use categorical data (ports, commodities) for analysis.
Use quantities for aggregate trends only, not individual precision.
