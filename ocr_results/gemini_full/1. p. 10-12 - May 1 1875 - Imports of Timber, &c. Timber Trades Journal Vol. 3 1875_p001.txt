At Yorkhill timber-yard on Friday, the 16th inst., Messrs. Farnworth and Jardine's cargo of Mexican mahogany, ex Prim, from Minatitlan, was exposed to public auction—Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co., agents. The cargo consisted of 360 logs mahogany; 127,918 sale feet. About 200 logs were sold, chiefly the largest dimensions, prices ranging from 4d. to 9d., yielding an average of 5 1/2d. per foot. There was a fair company, but not much competition. The small-sized wood did not seem to be much wanted, the market for some time past having been fairly supplied with this description.
On the 21st inst. a cargo of Norway whitewood deals and battens, ex Medea, was sold by Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchell at Yorkhill Wharf.
Deals, 9 x 3, C+G and F+F, brought from £9 5s. to £9 12s. 6d. per St. Petersburg standard.
Battens, 7 x 2 1/2, C+G and F+F, from 1 1/2d. to 1 3/4d. per lineal foot.
6 1/2 x 2 1/2, C+G and F+F and A+B, from 1 3/8d. to 1 1/2d. "
The attendance was good, and the whole of the cargo was sold, though the demand was by no means brisk.
Our public sales here for some time past give an indication that the trade is pretty well canvassed privately, and present wants in this way supplied. Meantime it is right to observe in reference to this market, that it is not in such a condition as will bear a heavy import this year, dealers and consumers alike appearing to be well supplied. The remainder of last year's stock is still considerable, with the exception, perhaps, of good first quality Quebec pine deals and American walnut. The Diana from Honduras, is now landing here a cargo of apparently fresh mahogany—large and moderate dimensions,—consigned to Wm. Connal and Co. The auction sale is to take place at Yorkhill Yard on Tuesday, the 11th May.

I cannot yet report any increase in the arrival of timber cargoes, the greater number of vessels having had straw. We have had fifteen cargoes, but there is no improvement in trade, everything is very dull.
We have had two or three timber sales, one of which, Tabasco mahogany, was exposed by Messrs. Shadbolt and Son, of London, Mr. makers, &c., and the whole cargo was cleared off at prices 7d. and upwards, the greater portion fetched 9 1/2d. to 1s.; one large log, measuring 620 feet, brought 2s. 2d.
There was a sale of St. John's timber advertised for same day, but in consequence of the time occupied in disposing of the above Mr. Thomson did not go on with it.
Messrs. Mitchell, Thomson, & Co., Granton, sold yesterday at their sale American wane square, 2s. 2d., 2s. 5d., and 2s. 7d.; square, 2s. Sawn timber brought very fair prices.
There was not such a large attendance of the trade generally, but a good muster of buyers. The demand for square timber was very limited. Present freights are—Cronstadt 37s. 6d. to 40s.; Wyborg, 40s. Narva, 40s. to 42s. 6d.; Quebec, 26s.

THE TYNE.
(From our own Correspondent.)
April 29th, 1875.
Since my last letter the timber trade of this district has to a large extent fulfilled the predictions I ventured to name therein. A steady consumption has gone on in the building trade, which continues very brisk, and a large quantity has been sold to the interior. Stocks at Tyne and Howden dock are becoming small. What cargoes have come to hand this season have gone away direct without being yarded. The arrivals have been principally common battens from Norway and small parcels of deals and battens per steamers from Gothenburg, and have principally met with a ready sale at more remunerative rates than last year's importations. As regards the future, the feeling of uncertainty as to prices has prevented importers from buying; merchants, whose purchases in former years would be some thousands of standards, have bought nothing or next to it this year, so that unless the market is supplied with cargoes on consignment, it is probable we may have some amount of scarcity and consequent advance of price ere long. American goods are still a slow sale, and firms who make this their staple trade are left with large stocks, and will have them to clear at ruinous prices.

The saw-mill trade is unusually brisk, order-books are full in most cases for some time to come, and many are obliged to work overtime in order to keep pressing wants supplied. Happily the disputes between masters and workmen in the chemical and iron trades are now settled, and a better feeling created, which, if continued, will prevent the recurrence of such disputes in future.
The Tyne Commissioners have now published the list of imports for the year ending 1874, which shows a very large increase upon previous years. Subjoined are the returns for the years 1872, 1873, and 1874.
Imports to Tyne from Foreign Ports from 1872 to 1874 :—
Deals, &c. and Boards. Wood Hoops. Laths and Lathwood. Timber.
Loads. Thousand. Loads. Loads.
1872 ............ 80,249 23,700 2,885 149,524
1873 ............ 86,846 21,390 3,068 183,682
1874 ............ 104,660 15,013 1,850 169,483
I leave the above figures to speak for themselves in view of the statements made so freely by Swedish and Norwegian houses in 1873 and 1874 as to stocks being so small abroad, and the probable of supplying the requirements. The statements made by them had very much to do with the losses experienced on this side through holding of large stocks, and one effect of that statement will certainly be to cause merchants here to buy with greater caution in the years to come.
