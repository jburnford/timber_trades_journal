V., from St. Domingo to Havre, with mahogany, put in here, 30th March, leaky.\nCHRISTIANSAND, 24th April. The Oscar, from Christiana to Mostyn, with wood, has put in here leaky, and must partly discharge.\nELSINORE, 22nd April. The Laurentra, of and from Windau for Havre, with timber, has put into the harbou to-day leaky.\n\nKEY WEST, 9th April. A few days ago two American schooners arrived here with forty-seven sticks of ranging timber, found derelict, but believed to be part of the cargo of the Evandale. The timber has been sold at auction for 386 dollars, and 60 per cent. salvage adjudged to the salvors.\n\nTHE NAVIGATION IN THE NORTH.—Stockholm, 26th April.—The ice between Sandhamn and this place was broken through yesterday; vessels can now come up to the town. Gefle, 22nd April.—The navigation here is not expected to be open before the middle or the latter end of May. Sundswall, 20th April.—The Ahlnosundet, Klinger fjord, and all the outer Skargard are still covered with thick ice. From the Bremo lighthouse, which is not yet lighted, there is to be seen a small opening in the ice, and outside of it drift ice. During the day we have 5 deg. to 8 deg. Celcius, but the nights being cold, the strength of the ice is not much reduced. If, therefore, we should not get fine weather soon, with rain and wind, the navigation may not be reopened before the end of May.\n\nCANADIAN NAVIGATION AND PROSPECTS.—The Quebec Chronicle of Monday, April 12th, contains the following:—\"Notwithstanding the superabundance of snow and ice, together with the continued cold weather, the recent warm weather and rain and sharp windstorms are good grounds for reasonable hope that the general opening of navigation will be but a trifle, if any, later than the average opening. Marine men, as a rule, entertain strong hopes of better times, and there are good reasons put forth for such hopes. No opening of navigation since that of 1872 has taken place when the lumber market was as promising as it is at present. The grain market is better than it was last year, and quite an increased demand in the iron ore trade is reported. Owners of timber vessels expect to have plenty for their boats to do at a good figure, while the transportation of coal promises unusually well, owing to the short supply on hand at Canadian and Upper Lake ports. But few charters have been reported as yet, but such as have been given to the public show decidedly better rates than those at the opening of last season. There seems to be a determination on the part of owners of timber and lumber vessels to establish fair rates, and action has already been taken at this port and several Canadian ports to gain that end and stick to it. Also a letter was received by a vessel broker at this port yesterday from a vessel owner at Chicago, stating that a meeting of grain dealers and vessel owners is soon to be held at that port, for the purpose of settling upon rates for grain cargoes, at which all parties could live.\"—Detroit Free Press.\n\n(From Woodworth's Price Current.)\nPENSACOLA FREIGHTS.—Deal freights are beginning to attract some attention, but the market continues quiet. The following deal charters are reported:—Abram Young, 75s. 6d., Dublin, 75s.; Ecuador, 1,100, deals, 30s. birch; steamship Columbia, 1,367, cargo delivered.\n\nDEATH OF MR. J. A. RANSOME.—We regret to announce the death on Thursday last of Mr. James Allen Ransome, head of the firm of Ransomes, Sims, and Head, the well-known agricultural implement makers. Deceased was born in Yarmouth in 1806. In 1820 he left school and was bound apprentice to the then firm, consisting of his grandfather, father, and uncle. In 1826 he was placed at Yoxford to manage a branch of the business, and whilst there established the Yoxford Farmers' Club, the second of its kind in England. Not long after, in conjunction with others, he set on foot the London Farmers' Club, and later still he was one of the few who established the Royal Agricultural Society of England. His love of literature, joined with his ardent desire to aid the working classes to raise themselves in the social scale, made him a warm supporter of the various literary and educational institutions of the town and country. The deceased was a great lover of horseflesh, his selections from stock being generally successful in obtaining prizes wherever shown.\n\nOTTAWA LUMBER TRADE.—Ottawa, 5th.—The business in this branch was dull last week, the only sales of any consequence being 1,750,000 feet of mill and shipping culls to a Montreal firm at from 8 to 8.75 dols. There is a demand for coarse lumber this spring for the Montreal market which has proved a great boon to our mill-owners, as that class of lumber has been dead stock for the past two seasons. With the sales now made the Chaudiere are is almost entirely cleaned out. Mill-owners round the Chaudiere are now becoming cognizant of the fact that they are starting off this spring on a much firmer basis than they formerly anticipated, on account of there being so little good lumber in the yards unsold, and they are consequently talking of firmer prices.—Ottawa Citizen.",
