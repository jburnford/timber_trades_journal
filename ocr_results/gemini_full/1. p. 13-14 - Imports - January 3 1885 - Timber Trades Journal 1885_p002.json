H. MARTIN.—A meeting for public exa-mination was held before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt last week in the case of William Henry Martin, of Khedive Road, Forest Gate, builder, who filed his petition on November 8th, returning his unsecured debts at £1,125 11s. 11d., and assets fully secured £3,409 2s. 6d., with assets £11s. 7d., of which £360 8s. 7d. was the estimated surplus from mortgaged property. At the first meeting a composition of 2s. 6d. in the pound was accepted, payable in fourteen days from the approval of the resolutions. On examination by the Official Solicitor the debtor stated that he began business about six and a half years since and had not kept any books. His houses were mortgaged to about their full value and the mortgagees were in possession. He attributed his difficulties to his inability to let the houses, and to having had two or three unfortunate contracts. He had never failed before. The Registrar allowed the bankrupt to pass his examination, but advised him if he resumed business to keep books, or he would get into trouble.\nMARSH.—The adjudication in this case was made in January, 1883, the bankrupt then trading as a builder at 51, Wellesley Road, Kentish Town, and the trustee (Mr. Percy Mason) applied to the Court last week for an order closing the bankruptcy. It appeared that the bankrupt had filed no accounts, and the trustee reported that he had been unable to discover any assets. There was no objection, and Mr. Registrar Hazlitt made the order.\nH. FOREMAN.—The bankrupt, Henry Foreman, of Fulham and Shepherd's Bush, builder and contractor, filed his petition in January last, and he applied to the Court last week for his order of discharge. The debts were stated in the accounts at £2,342 and the assets at £553, but it appeared that no dividend had been paid to the creditors. The application was opposed by the trustee and various creditors, who complained that the bankrupt had traded recklessly and contracted debts without reasonable expectation of payment. Mr. Registrar Brougham said that the bankrupt was a builder who got materials on credit and obtained advances upon the houses which he built, trusting to be able to sell them and to pay his debts out of the proceeds. He stated that he hoped to pay his debts when the houses were finished, and alleged that if creditors had not pressed him, and if Mr. Webster, who was assisting him had not stopped his advances, he would have met his liabilities. But this was a course of business which the Court must deprecate in the strongest possible terms. The practice of taking plots of ground and building upon credit with the view of selling the houses, and thus paying for the goods supplied, was most unsatisfactory, and the Court must mark its disapproval of such a course of trading by suspending the order of discharge for nine months.\nALFRED BROWN.—The debtor traded as a builder at 18, Fairview Road, Salisbury, and the first meeting of creditors was held at the office of the Official Receiver (Mr. F. Aston Dawes), Salisbury, on Tuesday, when there were several creditors present. The statement of affairs disclosed the following particulars:—Liabilities unsecured, £1,107 19s. 6d. ; assets, by stock-in-trade £10, household furniture £40, other property £39 12s., total £98 10s. less preferential creditors for rent, rates, taxes, and wages, &c., £6 16s. 3d., thus making the actual assets £91 13s. 9d., and leaving a deficiency of £1,016 5s. 9d. The debtor states that he cannot explain his deficiency in detail, but that his failure has been caused by depression in the building trade and depreciation in the value of local property, which had rendered it impossible for him to realize those which he had built at anything approaching the estimated value at the time of erection.

H. RICHARDSON.—A first meeting of creditors was held on Monday before Mr. Stewart, Assistant Receiver, under the failure of Charles Henry Richardson, of 5, Alice Road, Romford Road, Stratford, builder. The statement of affairs showed unsecured debts £540 6s. 6d., and debts fully secured £2,100, with assets (surplus from securities) £392 1s. The debtor attributed his failure and deficiency to his inability to sell the houses he had built, to losses on building contracts, and to his household and personal expenses. The Official Receiver reported that the debtor's books did not sufficiently disclose his business transactions and financial position. It was very doubtful if the estimated surplus from securities would be realized. An order for summary administration had been made by the Court. Mr. Nazer, on behalf of the debtor, offered a composition of 1s in the pound, but the offer was not entertained, and it was increased to 2s. in the pound, payable in two instalments, the first in fourteen days and the second in two months from approval. After a long and angry discussion the chairman adjourned the meeting in order that other creditors, who were not in attendance, might have an opportunity of expressing their views upon the debtor's proposal.\nThe number of failures in the building trade during the last week was 8, against 19 in the corresponding week of last year. The total number of failures was 93, against 163, showing a decrease of 70, and being a net decrease for 1884, to date, of 6,486.\nBILLS OF SALE.\n£\nHalliday Richard Albion, farmer and builder, Butts Farm, Hanworth, near Hounslow ... 200\nHeaysman James, victualler and builder, Bald Faced Stag Inn, Ashurst ... ... 237\nRoberts William, builder and contractor, 4, Alroy Road, Anfield, near Liverpool ... 294\nWadey Jabez, builder, Leeds Cottage, Church Street, and 39, Tamworth Road, Croydon 156\nYates Thomas, contractor and builder, Laburnum Villa, Aston Old Road, Fairfield, near Manchester ... ... ... ... 125\nBANKRUPTCY ACT, 1883.\nRECEIVING ORDERS.\nBrown Alfred, builder and beer retailer, 18, Fairview Road, Salisbury, exam.

To such, and to all, the answer is, \"Use the Gandy Belt.\" It has imitators, and this is the strongest proof possible that it is an article that is worth spending cash on to imitate. If it were a worthless article, or one that had not been very successful, no one would go to the expense and trouble to imitate it. Imitation is the strongest form of flattery, and those who imitate the \"Gandy\" Belt are proclaiming to all belt users that the \"Gandy\" Belt is the best that has ever been put before the public.\nThe \"Gandy\" Belt has acquired such a deservedly high reputation that belt users, after having tried all others, come back to Gandy, and declare that, notwithstanding the difference in price, they find it to their advantage to use the American Cotton Belt, made only by the inventor and patentee,\nMAURICE GANDY,\n130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON",
