THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
CLARKE, JOSEPH, builder, Rusthall, Tunbridge Wells.—The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held at the office of Messrs. Spencer & Reeves, Tunbridge Wells, under the chairmanship of Mr. A. P. Munt, deputy Official Receiver.
The statement of affairs set forth liabilities £403, and assets estimated by the debtor at £110, to which has to be added book debts amounting to £48.
The Official Receiver reported that the estate consisted of furniture which would realise £28, and a cottage, and the stock-in-trade of a jobbing builder, which would fetch about £25.
There was no other property, although one of the creditors had stated that certain goods had been delivered to a place at Langton.
The debtor, on whose behalf Mr. Palmer, solicitor, Tunbridge, appeared, said he could make no offer of a composition, but his son had come forward with £60, with which he would buy the stock-in-trade and other effects.
Mr. Young asked how it was the debtor first put down his liabilities at £160.
Debtor said he made the statement out in a hurry.
He added that he thought the whole of the property would be realised with the exception of about £2.
The Official Receiver was appointed as trustee, and creditors present were unanimous in advising the chairman to accept the debtor's son's offer.
The creditors are :—

CULVERHOUSE, A. & F. H., contractors, &c., Camden Town, and the East Park, Brickfields, Hampstead.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Thursday.
The debtors, trading in partnership under the firm of A. & F. Culverhouse, have filed their petition, and upon the application of Messrs. Rooke & Sons, his Honour made the usual receiving order.
The liabilities are estimated at £16,000, and assets are of considerable value, comprising 42 horses, 60 or 70 carts and vans, two boats, in addition to plant and materials.
The debtors are also engaged in parish contracts.
DOTTERILL, HENRY, of Canterbury Road, Croydon, builder.—This matter has again been before the court, the debtor attending to pass his adjourned public examination on the statement, showing gross liabilities, £8,265 12s. 3d., and assets, £264 18s. 8d.
The examination had been adjourned for a further deficiency account, the debtor stating that he had kept no books, and that the estimate of his assets was merely guess-work.
It now appeared that the debtor had not fully complied with the order of the court, and the Official Receiver (Mr. Cecil Mercer, of Westminster, S.W.) opposed his passing.
In the result an adjournment was taken until the next court, to permit of the debtor furnishing the necessary information as to his deficiency, £1,910.
GAMBLIN, JAMES.—The adjourned public examination of this bankrupt, whose failure had been previously reported, was held at the Portsmouth Bankruptcy Court, on Monday week, before Mr. Registrar Renny.
Mr. J. C. Moberly, Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, and Mr. William Edmunds, (the trustee) the estate.
Mr. Moberly intimated that he did not wish to pursue the examination further, and the trustee not opposing, the bankrupt was allowed to pass, subject to the manuscript of the shorthand notes of the previous examination being signed.
GOLD, HENRY, of Windsor, carriage-builder.—The statement of affairs and Official Receiver's report has just been issued by Mr. Cecil Mercer, of Westminster, and the public examination fixed to take place next week, at the Windsor District Bankruptcy Court.
The total liabilities disclosed amount to £4,409 19s. 7d., of which £624 14s. 7d. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend, the assets being £1,038 8s. 3d., from which sum £175 has to be deducted for preferential claims.
The assets consist of stock-in-trade, £260; fixtures and fittings, £30; furniture, £50; other property, £5; book debts, £281 1s. 3d.; bill of exchange, £2 10s.; surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured, £409 15s.
The creditors unsecured are £604 14s. 7d.; creditors fully secured, £3,640 5s. (the estimated value of the securities is £4,050, leaving a surplus, as already stated, of £409 15s.), and the creditors partly secured, £80.
The receiving order was made on the 2nd December, on the debtor's own petition.
The debtor states that his occupation has been that of a coachbuilder, and that he commenced some sixteen years ago with a capital of about £50.
He was in part-

JANUARY 1, 1887.]
nership with his brother, Benjamin Gold, the partnership was dissolved in or about 1881, and all liabilities were paid in full by his brother, and he (the debtor) is under no liability now in respect to that partnership.
He has kept a day book, ledger, bill, wages, and time books, but has never kept a cash book.
"In these books," says the Official Receiver, "he has handed over to me, I am unable to say whether they disclose his business and financial position or not."
The debtor states that in 1878 he filed his petition in the Windsor County Court, and paid (he thinks) a composition of 7s. in the pound, and all costs, and that the composition was paid by four instalments of three, six, nine, and twelve months.
The debtor attributes his present position to bad trade, and says he does not consider himself insolvent.
HAYNES, BENJAMIN, of Penge, builder.—The public examination in this matter was brought to a close at the Croydon Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Fox, and Mr. Cecil Mercer, Official Receiver, of Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W.
The matter has been already reported in our columns, and from information thus furnished it may be remembered that the gross liabilities were £1,832 4s. 9d., of which £609 5s. 5d. is expected to rank, the total assets being £234 10s. 6d.; also that a receiving order was made on the petition of Messrs. Gribble & Co., timber merchants, Vauxhall Cross, the debtor attributing his insolvency to being unable to dispose of his property in consequence of the depressed state of the market.
The Official Receiver had no further opposition to offer, and the Registrar ordered the examination to be closed.
HEAD, GEORGE & SON, builders and decorators, of Worthing.—At the Brighton Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, before Mr. B. Jennings, Registrar, these debtors appeared for adjourned public examination.
They attributed their failure to losses sustained some years ago, when their premises were attacked and destroyed during the Salvation Army riots.
In answer to Mr. F. G. Clark, trustee, Mr. Head, jun., stated that he had borrowed money for the firm without the permission of his father, who, the doctor had said, should not be worried with business affairs.
He had borrowed a sum of £90 from a Mr. Stubbs, and had paid £30 for the accommodation, although it was only for a short time.
He had not taken stock, nor had kept books to show profit and loss account.
At the last examination a creditor had alleged that the debtors had obtained goods from him by means of false pretences, having sent him a telegram to the effect that a cheque had been sent, which, when it arrived, was post-dated, jun., now produced a copy of the telegram, which stated that a cheque would be sent.
The Registrar having stated that debtors had a right to make the explanation, the examination was closed.

CREDITORS.
Buckley Brick and Tile Company
Eastwood & Co. (Limited), Lambeth
Hickman & Co., Stourbridge
There was no proposal, and the estate will be wound up in bankruptcy by the Official Receiver.
MABEY, WILLIAM, steam turner and cabinet-maker, Holdenhurst Road, Bournemouth.—At the Poole Bankruptcy Court recently an application was made to Serjeant Tindal Atkinson, Judge, by Mr. W. O. Pownall, solicitor, Salisbury, on behalf of the Official Receiver (Mr. F. Aston Dawes), for leave to disclaim a lease.
Mr. W. H. Druitt, on behalf of the sub-tenant, opposed, but his Honour granted the application.
Mr. Druitt then applied for compensation, and so much security that the sub-tenants should not be turned out.
His Honour said he could not help Mr. Druitt in the matter.
MAGUIRE, D. & G.—Further particulars have reached us of the failure of Messrs. D. & J. Maguire, Quebec.
A meeting of the creditors has, we learn, been held at the Montreal Bank, Quebec, when Mr. R. R. Dobell occupied the chair, and there were present also Hon. J. G. Ross, Mr. Samson Gunn, Mr. Perrin, of Peabody & Co., Mr. Porteous, and representatives of the Bank of Commerce and other interested parties.
Messrs. Maguire presented a statement, which lumps the liabilities at about 327,000 dols., and the assets at 300,000 dols.
The creditors and these amounts are set down as follows :—Mr. C. Samson, of St. Roch's, 195,000 dols., of which 130,000 dols. is in the shape of one year's sations and 65,000 dols. cash advances; Barings, 90,000 dols., a portion of which is secured on shipping; Hon. James G. Ross, 90,000 dols., of which a portion is secured by mortgages on shipping; Bank of Montreal, 60,000 dols., a large portion of which is guaranteed by Mr. Samson; Bank of Commerce, 40,000 dols., partially secured; Banque du Peuple, 20,000 dols., of which 17,500 dols. is secured by a deposit of Mr. Samson; Mr. R. R. Dobell & Co., 9,000 dols., and several smaller sums.
Twenty-two ships are given in the list of assets.
The insolvents produced the books which had been kept by them, from which it appeared that the last entry in the day book was made in the early part of October.
The creditors who had objected to the firm's system of bookkeeping pointed to this fact in justification of their complaints.
The insolvents surrendered their estate to the creditors, and the meeting proceeded to appoint three trustees to take charge of it.
They were named, the Hon. James G. Ross and Mr. Kennedy, in the office of Messrs. R. R. Dobell & Co.
The third is to be appointed by the Bank of Montreal.
The trustees will make a full investigation into the affairs of the firm, and will report as to the best means of realising upon the estate.
It is said that the third trustee has been appointed by the Bank of Montreal and is Mr. Meredith, of Montreal.
There is a report current that Mr. Kennedy, one of the trustees, and an employe of Mr. R. R. Dobell will be sent to Buenos Ayres to look after the interests of the estate there.
Meanwhile Mr. James Maguire continues to manage the estate under instructions from the trustees.
Mr. Geo. E. Perrin, of Messrs. Kidder, Peabody, & Co., the American representatives of the Barings, has left Quebec, leaving the interests of his firm, who are said to be involved to the extent of about 90,000 dols., in the hands of Messrs. W. & A. H. Cook, advocates.
