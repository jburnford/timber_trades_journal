THE GAZETTE.
FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount]

DAWSON, THOMAS, carpenter and undertaker, of Sutton.—This debtor has surrendered for public examination in bankruptcy before Mr. Registrar Fox and Mr. Cecil Mercer, district Official Receiver, of Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W. Mr. Pettiver now appeared for the debtor. The Official Receiver asked for an adjournment on the ground that the first meeting had not been held, and Mr. Fox granted the application. The failure is attributed to bad trade and loss on contracts.

DAY, GEORGE, carpenter, 26, Riding House Street, W.—This case has been previously reported, and the bankrupt passed his public examination on Friday before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The accounts as amended show liabilities £802 12s. 2d., and assets £49 3s. 10d.

ESKRIGGE, R. C. & Co.—Mr. Josiah Eskrigge and R. J. Eskrigge, a firm of builders at Bootle, who appeared on their adjourned public examination at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court on Monday last. Mr. Johnson (Messrs. Yates & Co.), who appeared for the Official Receiver, examined them as to their dealings with Mr. George Smith, a contractor, and Messrs. Halsall & Sons. Mr. R. C. Eskrigge said he had no knowledge of the financial dealings of the firm. Mr. R. J. Eskrigge, in reply to various questions as to the disposal of a gas engine and some other machinery to Mr. G. Smith, said he had since received a cheque for £150, which he had not an account. He could not say what his exact position was with regard to a bill for £620 given to Mr. Smith, but it was not an accommodation bill. The examination was further adjourned to the 4th of August, the learned Registrar warning the bankrupt that he must be prepared with more definite answers, or he would run the risk of having the examination adjourned sine die.

EVERETT, C. H., builder and contractor, Iverson Road, Kilburn.—This failure occurred in January, 1886, and the bankrupt applied on Friday for his order of discharge. The liabilities were £15,401 2s., and the trustee reported that the assets had realised £447 7s. 5d. It appeared that the bankrupt commenced business about fourteen years prior to the receiving order, and the Official Receiver only objected that the books were imperfectly kept. The Registrar suspended the discharge for one month.

JONES, R. & J. WILLIAMS.—This case came before the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court on Friday week. Mr. Carver (instructed by Messrs. Harvey, Alsop, & Stevens) appeared for the trustee of the estate; Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Mulholland (instructed by Messrs. Bateson & Co.) appeared for Messrs. Price & Pierce, timber brokers, who claimed the title to a quantity of greenheart timber, valued at £3,000, now lying on the land of the Mersey Dock Board in Regent Street, Liverpool. Mr. Pickford (instructed by Messrs. Whitley, Maddock, & Hampson) appeared for Messrs. Brown, bankers, who held certain bills which they claimed should be met out of the proceeds of the sale of the timber. The object of the motion, which was part heard, was to declare the property in the timber in question. It appeared that last autumn Messrs. Jones, a firm of timber merchants in Liverpool, obtained an advance of £1,500 from Messrs. Guy & Co., of London, on a quantity of timber, and the latter firm obtained an advance of £1,500 on the timber from Messrs. Price & Pierce. Subsequently Messrs. Guy & Co. became bankrupt, and the question was, that the document under which the timber was transferred to Messrs. Guy & Co., by the Bills of Sale Act, and, not having been registered, it could not be sustained. He also contended, failing that, that Messrs. Guy & Co. had no power to transfer, and that their transfer of timber to Messrs. Price & Pierce was, therefore, bad. Mr. Carver, on behalf of the holders of the bills, argued that Messrs. Guy & Co. being bankrupt, the proper course to adopt was to sell the timber, and devote the proceeds in the first instance to the satisfaction of the bills. His Honour reserved his decision.

LEWIS, JACOB, of South Norwood, builder.—The adjourned public examination has just taken place. There being now no further opposition the debtor was allowed to pass his examination subject to swearing to the usual memoranda on the file.
