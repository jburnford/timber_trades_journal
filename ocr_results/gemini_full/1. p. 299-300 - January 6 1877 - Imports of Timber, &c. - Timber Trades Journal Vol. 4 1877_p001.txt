continue light, and prices are well maintained. Ready sales continue light, and we do not now anticipate more until reopening of the navigation.
(ERRATUM.—In our last report the words “in the shipbuilding trade” should have read “in the building trade.”)

LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.)
January 4, 1877.
There is no new feature in the timber trade that I can report on. There were no arrivals in Leith or Granton during the last fortnight, and we have had no arrivals of battens at Dundee, and seven cargoes pitwood at Bo'ness.
The first public sale this year will take place on the 16th at the Burgh Saw mills—Messrs. W. Stewart, and Co.—and will consist of sawn pine boards, birch, mahogany, &c.; deals and battens, flooring, spokes, felloes, &c.

GLASGOW.

January 3rd, 1877.
The annual general review of our local timber trade is being prepared for your issue of 20th inst. as required. Meantime I have only one auction sale to notice, which took place on the 21st ult., at Yorkhill Wharf here; Messrs. Singleton, Dunn and Co., brokers.
Considering the near approach of the new year holiday season, the attendance was good, though, as might be expected, there was not much disposition to stock largely.
A considerable portion of the goods offered, comprising some unreserved lots, was taken up with fair competition.

BRISTOL.
(From Mr. G. M. Barnes' Circular.)
January 1st, 1877.
There has been a fair amount of business during the past month, excepting during the holidays, which as a matter of course cannot be avoided.
Quebec yellow pine.—There has been only a light demand. Red pine is neglected. Oak, fair demand. Elm, ash, and birch are in request. Deals, demand good and prices firm. Staves and lathwood quiet. New Brunswick goods.—The importation may now be considered nearly over for the season; there has been a good demand, and prices are firmer. Baltic timber.—Memel, &c.—Fair demand. Oak has gone better into consumption. Russia deals.—Demand good and prices firm. Swedish deals.—Fair demand for all descriptions, especially for the better class of goods. Pitch pine timber.—Demand good and stocks reduced. Mahogany.—A cargo will be sold by auction on Thursday the 18th.

CARDIFF.
(From Messrs. Tellefsen, Wills, & Co.'s Circular, December 15th, 1876.)
Prices of pitwood have slightly advanced since our last issue; this may no doubt be attributed somewhat to the sudden rise in freights from the French ports, combined with the fact that there has been a falling off in the supply of about 4,000 tons compared with the previous month. The total imports amount to 14,142 tons, of which 11,587 tons are from France; 1,704 tons from Ireland; 686 tons from England, and 166 tons from Holland.
The arrivals of foreign timber and deals have been few, the import season having nearly closed. Particulars are as follows:—
Sundsvall ... ... 618 loads.
Gothenburg ... ... 310 „
Cronstadt ... ... 357 „
Skonvik ... ... 339 „
