Sainsbury, of Paris, consists in employing a solution formed in the relative approximate proportions of water, 1,000 litres ; alum, 16 kilos ; sulphate of copper, 16 kilos ; bromide of sodium, 1 kil. ; and iodide of potassium, 1 kil. For the purpose of the invention, he prefers placing the timber or wood in a close vessel, from which he draws off all the air, and in which he immediately injects the above-mentioned liquid with a pressure varying from 15 lbs. to 150 lbs. to the inch. It is stated that wood thus injected not only acquires thereby a considerable degree of hardness, whereby it is better fitted to resist wear and tear from exposure to the atmosphere, and deteriorating causes, but it is also rendered completely incombustible.\n\nMIRAMICHI DEALS.—The lumber shipments from Miramichi to the United Kingdom and Europe for the season just closed (the last vessel having sailed) amounted to about 116,000,000 feet, or in the vicinity of 12,000,000 feet more than was shipped during the season of 1875. The following is a comparative table of the lumber shipments to Europe from the port of Chatham for the seasons of 1875 and 1876:—\nDeals, &c. Palings. Lumber.\nSup. feet. Pieces. Tons.\n1875 ... 85,400,193 1,558,626 2,656\n1876 ... 92,978,194 4,961,524 2,471\n\nLIVERPOOL AND THE TIMBER TRADE.—At the last meeting of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, Mr. Forwood, in moving the adoption of the proceedings of the traffic committee, alluding to the obstruction caused to the timber trade, owing to the want of facilities that ought to be provided by the railway companies. The board having spent millions to make Liverpool the cheapest international port in the world, would surely awaken to the necessity of taking steps in the matter—Mr. Harrison said he was not sure that the fault lay with the railway companies. Many purchasers of a cargo lived in places where they had not room to receive it at the different stations, and the board required it to be removed at once. The railway company could not take it all at once, because the party for whom it was going had no accommodation to receive it. This pointed to the fact that the cargo might be forwarded with a greater amount of space, in order as to meet the views of the parties that were to receive it.—Mr. Forwood, in an argument on behalf of the railway companies. If the timber were brought here, it remained for the railway companies to find the interior arrangements. They must be forced to do their duty to the town.—Mr. Jardine said the greatest difficulty to contend with was the water-carriers. He thought the board had something to do in providing proper accommodation. The matter then dropped.\n\nRUSSIAN FORESTS.—At the recent annual meeting of the Russian Ironworks Company, Limited, the chairman stated as the result of his recent visit to the forests owned by the company that he regarded the rise in the price of wood as permanent, and they had therefore decided to pursue the policy of making contracts with the Government and other parties for a permanent supply. The company has induced the Russian Government to grant them a certain amount of forest yearly for twelve years.\n\nPIT-PROPS FROM BORDEAUX.—The export of pit-props from Bordeaux to this country during the month of November was 14,356 tons, which were distributed as follows :—Newport, 6,953 ; Cardiff, 5,367 ; Swansea, 1,473 ; Porthcawl, 329 ; Briton Ferry, 152 ; Llanelly, 82.\n\nJANUARY 6, 18[??]\nA[??]\n(Pro[??])\nThe general d[??]\nthe home wants [??]\nment until after [??]\nare still more or [??]\nto South Ameri[??]\nanticipations, b[??]\ntendency [??]\ntively small su[??]\ncessions at pre[??]\nwithout an at[??]\ncrop, we find [??]\nwherever an o[??]\nbe cut, and al[??]\n\nThe season [??]\nsatisfactorily [??]\naway.
