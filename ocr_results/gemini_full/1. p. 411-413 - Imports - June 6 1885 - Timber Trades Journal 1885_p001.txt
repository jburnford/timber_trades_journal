SALE OF OAK BARK.—Messrs. Parish & Son, of Horncastle, held their annual sale of oak bark, growing on various estates in the neighbourhood, at the Northern Hotel, Lincoln, on Friday, May 29th, when they disposed of upwards of 1,000 tons. The prices realized ranged from 70s. to 82s. 6d. per ton, but about a third of the quantity offered fetched the former price. The bark was sold for ready money, subject to a discount of 5 per cent., delivered free on rails at adjacent railway stations.

LARGE FIRES.—Throughout Sunday last a large proportion of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade was engaged in endeavouring to subdue a fire which broke out between eight and nine o'clock in the morning at the extensive timber stores of Messrs. Higgs & Hill, builders, South Lambeth Road, the extensive premises comprised, among several other sheds, timber stacks. About half-past eight an alarm of fire was raised upon the premises, and Superintendent Hamlyn arrived he found that the flames had obtained a complete hold of three of the stacks, and a fire of tremendous fury was raging. Additional aid was ordered, and as soon as the steamers came up they were got to work with a plentiful supply of water. The stacks alone covered an area of over a hundred feet square, and as one after another these great masses of timber became involved the heat from the fire became so great that a long store, also belonging to Messrs. Higgs & Hill, ignited, and was soon burning furiously. Although the steam fire engines worked all the morning, their efforts seemed unavailing for several hours to have little effect upon the burning wood. It was not until the afternoon that they had very considerably advanced [?] be obtained [?] had very considerable last a most [?] On Monday the saw-mills belonging to Mr. Archibald Millar, contractor, Hope Street, Motherwell, Glasgow, and the two-story dwelling-house of the master and mistress of the Hamilton Street School. Mr. Millar's saw-mill with the damage which is only partially covered by insurance, was almost wholly destroyed, and the damage is estimated at between £4,000 and £6,000. The schoolhouse was also destroyed. The Hamilton fire-engine and the Motherwell fire hose were early on the ground, but little could be done to check the flames.
