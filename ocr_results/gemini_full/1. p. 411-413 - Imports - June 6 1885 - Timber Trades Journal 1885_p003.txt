BEACH & HOWLETT.—A meeting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Murray. The bankrupts, described as of the Great Northern Railway Yard, Frederick Street, Caledonian Road, and of Watford, builders' merchants, filed their petition on April 7th, and furnished accounts disclosing joint liabilities expected to rank £5,176 9s. 1d., with assets £2,222 3s. 6d.
Mr. S. Ward appeared for the trustee, and asked for an adjournment pending further investigation, a private sitting having been appointed for the 23rd inst. The Official Solicitor considered the application a reasonable one, and the bankrupts not objecting, his Honour adjourned the public examination to July 1st.
RICHARD CONDER.—The bankrupt, who was a builder in a large way of business at Ball's Pond and Hackney, filed his petition on January 21st, and he applied to the Court on Wednesday for his order of discharge. The liabilities amounted to £19,463, and the assets were returned at £4,438. The Official Receiver reported that the books had been imperfectly kept, not having been written up since October, 1884. Mr. W. Lawrance appeared for the trustee, and said that he was not instructed to oppose. On behalf of the bankrupt it was stated that all the materials were in the books, and the only objection was that they had not been fully written up. Mr. Registrar Murray said that he could not, under the circumstances, grant an immediate order of discharge, but he should only suspend it for three months.
W. O. PEARCE.—An adjourned meeting for public examination was held in this case on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The bankrupt, who traded as a timber merchant at 61, Gracechurch Street, under the firm of W. O. Pearce & Co., returned his liabilities at £8,096 19s. 5d., and assets £988 10s. 4d. Mr. S. Ward, who appeared for the trustee, asked for a further short adjournment in the interest of all parties, as an advantageous arrangement might be carried out. The bankrupt consented, and the meeting was adjourned to the 18th inst.
