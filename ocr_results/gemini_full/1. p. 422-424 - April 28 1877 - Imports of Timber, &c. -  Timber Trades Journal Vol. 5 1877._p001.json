The arrivals have been principally common battens from Norway, with two or three small Gothenburg cargoes, but sales are very languid, and but little prospect of improvement for some time to come.\n\nGLASGOW.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nApril 25th, 1877.\nThe only arrivals 'into Clyde during last fortnight have been—one cargo Mexican (Uspanapan) mahogany; one cargo St. John, N.B., spruce deals per steamer, and one cargo battens from Namsos. The consumption of wood goods meantime is considerable, the depletion of deals from storage yards having been going on so steadily since our last communication, that the stock on hand may now be estimated as small for this time of the year.\nMessrs. Edmiston and Mitchells held a public sale of deals at Yorkhill Wharf, Glasgow, on the 12th inst., at which there was a very good attendance and fair competition in bidding, the whole catalogue being cleared out. The same brokers held another sale at Greenock on the 19th inst. The goods offered consisted of Quebec waney boardwood, Quebec yellow and red pine, ash, and birch, also sawn pitch pine timber.\nPrices realized at the above sales were as follows, for the usual dimensions imported :—\nMichigan pine deals, 1st quality, £21 6s. to £25 15s. 6d. per St. P. stnd.\nQuebec pine deals, 3rd \" (ordinary) £9 5s. 6d. to £10 13s. \"\n\" waney boardwood, 50 ft. per log average, 1s. 10½d. to 2s. 1d. per cubic ft., 40 ft. average, 1s. 8½d.\nOrdinary yellow pine building timber, 50 ft. per log, 1s. 5½d. and 1s. 6d.\nQuebec red pine, 40 to 50 ft., 1s. 4½d. to 1s. 6½d.\n\" ash, 1s. 3½d.\n\" birch, 1s. 2d.\n\" basswood, 1s. 3d.\nPitch pine (sawn), 40 logs sold, 35 and 40 ft. average, 1s. 4½d. and 1s. 5d.\n\nLEITH.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nApril 25th, 1877.\nArrivals this last fortnight are very limited—say 30 vessels, out of which 21 are loaded with pit props for Bo'ness and 7 for Leith, battens.\nWe have had three timber sales, viz.—Messrs. Hutchison and Rogers on the 17th. There was a very fair attendance, but the buyers were very shy, and could not be induced to bid. Prices obtained were—\nMichigan pine boards 2 0 per cubic foot.\nRiga red wood logs 1 3½ \" \" short lengths.\nSwedish ditto 1 1 \" \" small lot.\nPitch pine ditto 1 3½ \" \"\nDitto ditto deals 1 3½ \" \"\nCrown Petersburg red deals 11 x 3 3 0 6 per running foot.\nSecond ditto 7 x 2½ 0 11½\nArchangel 7 x 3 0 11½\nDitto 7 x 2½ 0 11½\nRiga 10½ x 3 0 3½\nJoisting deals 9 x 3—2 1/8d.; 11 x 3—3 1/8 to 3 5/8d.\nDeals 12 x 4 0 5½\nBattens 6½ x 2½—1 1/8 1 5/8d.\nFlooring 1 3 to 1 4½\nLining 0 11½\nSarking 0 8½ per yard.\nBirch 1 8½\nOther hardwood not in demand.\nMessrs. Ferguson, Davidson, and Co. sold on the 19th Michigan pine boards, fine quality, at 2d., 2¼d., 2½d., averaging 5/8 in. in thickness.\ns. d. s. d.\nSmall yellow pine logs 1 3½ 1 3½\nFlooring 1 0\nLining 1 0\nSarking 0 8½\nThis sale was chiefly composed of Michigan boards, a good many lots were disposed of, but the company was not so large as might have been expected.\nMessrs. W. Stewart and Co. had their sale yesterday.\nCut yellow pine boards brought 1½ to 2d.\nSecond white battens 6½ x 2½ 1 1/8.\n\nThere was a good muster of buyers, but no competition, in consequence of which the sale was brought early to a close.\nMessrs. Jas. Duncan and Co. will offer for sale on the 1st May American and Baltic timber, &c. (See advertisement.)\nMessrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co., timber, deals, battens, &c., on the 8th May, in their yard, Anderston Street. (See advertisement.)\n\nCARDIFF.\n(From Messrs. Tellefsen, Wills, and Co.'s Circular, April 15th.)\nThe arrivals of large quantities of French pitwood have again completely glutted the market; and during March, to save the expenses and loss in landing (in weight caused by the March winds), merchants were glad to plac the wood at a great reduction in price, in order to sell it ex ship. Prices are now quite as low as they have been any time within the last three years.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From April 12th to 26th.\nHewn Timber (loads).\nRussia—314 Gabriel & Sons.\nPrussia—1,382 Burt & Co.\nNorway—14 Tofte & Co.\nSweden—16 Arnold & Co.\nU.
