ebb. The arrivals have been principally common battens from Norway, with two or three small Gothenburg cargoes, but sales are very languid, and but little prospect of improvement for some time to come.

GLASGOW.
(From our own Correspondent.)
April 25th, 1877.
The only arrivals 'into Clyde during last fortnight have been—one cargo Mexican (Uspanapan) mahogany; one cargo St. John, N.B., spruce deals per steamer, and one cargo battens from Namsos. The consumption of wood goods meantime is considerable, the depletion of deals from storage yards having been going on so steadily since our last communication, that the stock on hand may now be estimated as small for this time of the year.
Messrs. Edmiston and Mitchells held a public sale of deals at Yorkhill Wharf, Glasgow, on the 12th inst., at which there was a very good attendance and fair competition in bidding, the whole catalogue being cleared out. The same brokers held another sale at Greenock on the 19th inst. The goods offered consisted of Quebec waney boardwood, Quebec yellow and red pine, ash, and birch, also sawn pitch pine timber.
Prices realized at the above sales were as follows, for the usual dimensions imported :—
Michigan pine deals, 1st quality, £21 6s. to £25 15s. 6d. per St. P. stnd.
Quebec pine deals, 3rd " (ordinary) £9 5s. 6d. to £10 13s. "

Messrs. W. Stewart and Co. had their sale yesterday.
Cut yellow pine boards brought 1½ to 2d.
Second white battens 6½ x 2½ 1 1/8.

There was a good muster of buyers, but no competition, in consequence of which the sale was brought early to a close.
Messrs. Jas. Duncan and Co. will offer for sale on the 1st May American and Baltic timber, &c. (See advertisement.)
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co., timber, deals, battens, &c., on the 8th May, in their yard, Anderston Street. (See advertisement.)

CARDIFF.
(From Messrs. Tellefsen, Wills, and Co.'s Circular, April 15th.)
The arrivals of large quantities of French pitwood have again completely glutted the market; and during March, to save the expenses and loss in landing (in weight caused by the March winds), merchants were glad to plac the wood at a great reduction in price, in order to sell it ex ship. Prices are now quite as low as they have been any time within the last three years.
