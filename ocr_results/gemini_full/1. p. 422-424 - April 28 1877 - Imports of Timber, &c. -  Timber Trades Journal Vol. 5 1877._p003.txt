American Intelligence.
NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," April 14th.)
WITH one or two exceptions, the various styles of lumber sold on our market are reported more cheerful, and in a quiet, careful way are taking a roseate view of the situation. Dealers in no case having taught them to count upon business as doubtful until negotiations are finally and positively closed; but some of the current indications are cited as tending to inspire a slight degree of hope. The probability that favourable weather will prevail is of itself an influence of no small magnitude as bearing upon the local inquiry. The retail distribution is gradually increasing, and a number of buyers have of late been evidently on the look-out for fresh supplies when they arrive. Stocks in first hands also are reduced, and though transportation facilities are improving, there is no reason to believe that much lumber will be brought forward at present. The export movement, in the meanwhile, keeps quite a little stock going out all the time, and affords decided relief for many grades. Since the river opened there is said to have been quite a fair trade done in the Albany district at reasonably full rates, and, with stocks reduced, holders now incline to firmness

and increased cost. We can find none of our dealers, however, who have purchased to any extent, and the majority claim that they must continue to work along in the hand-to-mouth policy.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," April 4th.)
The question of banking is now pretty much settled, and camps are breaking up on all sides, a few only remaining here and there to finish out some lingering contract before departing for the confines of civilization. The amounts now upon the banks are what are to tell the story, as not enough more will be put in to cut any material figure.
There is a very general apprehension throughout the north-west that there will not be water enough in the streams to float the drives, which it is feared will occasion many logs to be hung up.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," March 29th.)
The yard market this morning presents the quiet appearance which has been its condition since our last report. Between the snow and mud that is, and the grass hoppers that in a good many sections are liable to be, the demand for lumber from the country is much restricted, and as a natural consequence orders and sales are limited, both in number and amount. Where more favourable weather has prevailed, the country operators report a better demand from the farmers, and hence are them-looking forward to a fair selves more disposed to buy. With but few exceptions, our dealers are fairly busy season, and many of them assert that their prospects are much more encouraging than they have been for some time.

THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman and Manufacturer," April 4th.)
The situations and surroundings all being taken into account, we think the lumber trade has as little to complain of as any other equally important branch of business. All commodities have suffered a material reduction on the figures of a few years ago, and the volume of trade has fallen off from both local and general causes, and those who have enjoyed a brisk business with quick sales and large profits, now chafe at the lagging of business and complain of a reasonable proportion of the business of the country as afflicting them in a specially hard way.
Prices will remain unsettled until the question of driving is decided, whether the crops of the West are to be eaten up again this year by the grasshoppers. Every section of the lumber region is afflicted with a great want of water, and it is doubtful whether any of the rivers will have the year's crop secured for use this season, as in this latitude heavy rains are not usual in the early spring, and later ones generally confer but little benefit, because the men are not on the ground to take advantage of the sudden rise following a storm, and cannot reach the woods before the floods subside.

QUEBEC.
(From the "Quebec Chronicle," April 6th.)
The Quebec Board of Trade held its annual meeting on April 3rd, and the following is an extract of the report on the lumber trade:— The export of our chief article of trade, wood, has been on a larger scale than last year, and, on the whole, the business of the season was fairly satisfactory, both to the manufacturer and to the exporter.
A much larger quantity of small and common white pine was, however, manufactured than our market could take, and a considerable portion remains unsold. The excessive quantity of small red pine manufactured in the previous winter, too, has acted very unfavourably on the value of that article.
The production of third quality pine deals, and spruce of all qualities, appears to have been beyond the demand, inasmuch as the stocks in the leading markets of England, as well as here, are too large, and the prices unremunerative.
The dulness of the United States market has also led to new difficulties of an unexpected character. A very large quantity of deals, chiefly of first quality, were manufactured in Michigan for the British market, and shipped via New York and Quebec, without reference to the capabilities of the various markets to which they were shipped, or the dimensions most suitable for the wants of the trade. The result is that in many cases they have been sacrificed at prices far below their intrinsic value, and Canadian goods have suffered in consequence. Shipments of oak and board pine are now being made in New York from the same source.
From all accounts it would appear that, owing to low wages and favourable weather, the production of most articles of wood during the present winter, both in Canada and Michigan, is likely to be again too large. This is greatly to be deplored, as it does nothing but harm all round. The markets in Britain would take a limited quantity of our expensive woods at remunerative prices, but our excessive production leads to losses to all engaged in the trade, and benefits only the consumer, whilst our forests are annually depleted of most valuable woods, which, if allowed to stand, would be a source of immense wealth in future years, instead of being sacrificed at prices which often barely cover the cost of manufacture and carriage.
