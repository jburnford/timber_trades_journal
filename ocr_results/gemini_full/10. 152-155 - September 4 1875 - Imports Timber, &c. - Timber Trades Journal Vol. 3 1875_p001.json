The docks are bare of ships, and the quays show large empty spaces amounting in the aggregate to acres. We are now entering upon the ninth month of the year—a year of quietness or dulness, so far as import­ing of timber is concerned, that will long be remembered. Wood freights are somewhat steady, owing to the question of the grain harvest of this country assuming a more settled form. It may fairly be said that the prognostications respecting a bad harvest, so current during the period of the late rains, will not be realized. This is fortunate, as our money will not be wanted for shipment to the Continent to purchase corn, and the shipowners will not on their part realize their anticipated advance of freights. We hear of consign­ments being attempted by foreign houses, but they are not heavy in their character.\nI have to correct a typographical error in my last report.

We are not, however, in the least degree sorry for this detention, it having enabled us to get away a lot of outstanding orders, as well as the removal of a large quantity of goods from off the quay, thereby preparing us for the arrival of\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL [SEPTEMBER 4, 1875.\nanother fleet, which may be calculated upon as a certainty with a change of wind.\nForeign shippers are firm in their quotations with a likelihood of higher rates of freight and insurance; notwithstanding this, retailers are giving their orders very sparingly, fully anticipating a further reduction in prices.\n\nLEITH.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nSeptember 2nd, 1875.\nTimber market here remains very quiet, and little doing. Messrs. W. Thomson and Co. had a sale on the 24th ult. of American timber. The trade was well represented, and several lots were sold, but the prices were very low.\nMessrs. Wishart and Son will offer for sale on the 7th inst., at the Queen's Dock, a cargo deals.\nThe arrivals this last fourteen days have been very few compared with same date last year. She has had a very long passage. Another vessel has been expected for some time past, but not yet arrived. Freights from the Baltic remain low, and tonnage is not sought after.\n\nGLASGOW.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nSeptember 2nd, 1875.\nThe imports into Greenock of American timber in log have been rather on a sparing scale this year, at least so far as the season has advanced,—a cautious arrangement, the result no doubt of the glutted state of the market at the end of last year, and the compara­tively poor prospects of shipbuilders at that time.\nThings, however, are beginning to brighten up a little in that line. To-day we learn that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company have ordered a new ship to be built here of about 3,400 tons, and other two steam vessels of 3,000 tons have been purchased for the North German Lloyds Company. House-building is continuing tolerably busy, and a very large amount of alterations is now going on in the city. These alterations, however, do not indicate a very large consumption of wood.\nThe rates or prices are much the same as quoted in my last letter.\nOn the 24th instant a cargo of Tonala mahogany was offered by auction at Yorkhill Timber Wharf,—Singleton, Dunn and Co., agents. About 150,000 feet were sold at from 3½d. to 1s. per foot, average about 6d. The logs were generally of large dimensions; large fine wood brought fair rates, but the medium-sized wood was difficult to sell, even at minimum prices. The sale was dull. Some lots were left unsold, along with a large quantity of Mexican wood of former imports.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From Aug. 20th—Sept. 1st, 1875.\nTimber, Deals, &c.—Nor @ Chatham, N.B.,—14,192 deals, 1,472 ends, Order.
