PLYMOUTH, 30 Aug.—The Nadinka, from Christianstad to Malaga, with deals, has put in here, having been in collision off the South Foreland, on the 28th Aug., at 1.15 a.m., with a Swedish schooner, bound up Channel, in ballast, which latter vessel lost her jibboom and had her bows damaged. The Nadinka had her bulwarks, stanchions and rails on the starboard bow stove in, and lost head sails. Name of Swedish schooner unknown.
