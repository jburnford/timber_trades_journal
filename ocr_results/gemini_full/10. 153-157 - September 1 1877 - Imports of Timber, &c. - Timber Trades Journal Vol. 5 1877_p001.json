Thomas Robinson and Son, of Rochdale, and part of which has already been fixed, will be of an expensive kind, and designed on the newest principles.\nThe works, in many respects, will be unique.\nFew saw-mills in the district will be able to turn out such excellent work.\nOperations will be begun, it is expected, by the latter part of next month.\nMr. Joseph Coxon is the contractor for the buildings, but part of the structural work will be done by Mr. Brown himself.\nThe demand for wood goods continues to be far from active, but prices are throughout very well maintained.\n\nNEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nAugust 30th, 1877.\nThe timber trade of the district continues in the same quiet condition, and apparently not much prospect of any early improvement.\nSawn goods are coming forward in only small quantities, for the better classes of deals a fair inquiry is made, and for these full prices are given.\nProp wood is coming forward largely, and as shippers are holding out for larger prices, it is expected a rise will take place.\n\nGLASGOW.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nAugust 29th, 1877.\nThe imports of American and Baltic timber to Clyde ports during the last fortnight have been seven cargoes.\nThe trade carried on in the city meantime is limited compared to the autumns of recent years, nor is there yet any decided appearance of improvement.\nOn the 20th inst. the master shipbuilders agreed to throw their works open (pending the decision of the arbiters) to those workmen required at the same rate of wages as before the strike, and it was provided that should the decision of the arbiters be in favour of the men, the increase would be paid from the date of commencing work.\nPractically the lock-out was now at a close; several joiners and smiths accepted engagements; but the operative shipwrights who were the first to strike have not yet shown any disposition to resume work on the above terms.\nOn the 16th inst. Messrs. Allison, Cousland, and Hamilton held a public sale at Greenock; and Messrs. Hunter, Sheriff, and Co. on the 23rd inst. at Port Glasgow.\nRates as under:—\nQuebec waney boardwood, 47 to 50 ft. pr. log, at 21d. to 23d. per c. ft.\n„ yellow pine, good, 43 to 70 ft., 16d. to 2s.\n„ do. small, ordinary 14d. to 16d.\n„ red pine 33 feet 15 1/2d.\n„ Elm one page 21d.\n„ Ash 35 feet 14d.\n„ Birch 18 1/2d. and 19d.\nPensacola pitch pine, sawn, 30 to 35 feet, 15d.\nMichigan pine deals, 1st quality, £20 5s. 7d. to £23 14s. 4d. per St. Petersburg standard.\n\nLEITH.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nAugust 15th, 1877.\nArrivals here have not been so numerous this fortnight.\nThere is a decrease of 28 vessels as compared with the previous fortnight.\nMy present return shows 48 cargoes.\nThese consist of 18 cargoes deals and battens, 11 cargoes pit props, 6 cargoes sleepers, 4 cargoes Baltic timber, 5 cargoes lathwood, several lots ditto, and 1 cargo Quebec deals and hardwood.\nThere have been three sales, viz., on the 21st, Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co., deals and battens.\nThere was a very fair attendance of buyers, but the weather was very unfavourable; it rained nearly the whole day.\nA good many lots were disposed of; prices were not up to last week's sale, and the demand was rather limited.\nPrices realized were—\nCrown Petersburg red deals 7x3 2 1/4d.\n„ „ „ 9x3 3 1/8d.\n„ „ „ 7x2 1/2 2 1/8d.\nSecond „ „ 11x3 4d.\n„ „ „ 11x3 3 1/8d. to 3 1/2d.\nWyborg „ „ 9x3 2 1/8d. to 2 1/4d.\n„ „ „ 7x2 1/2 1 1/8d.\n„ „ „ 6 1/2x2 1/2 1 7/8d.\nNorway white battens 7x2 1/2 1 5/8d. to 1 3/4d.\n„ „ 6x2 1/2 1 5/8d. to 1 3/4d.\nOnega deals were not in demand.\nMessrs. George Shadbolt and Sons, London, sold on account of Samuel Lett, Esq., on the same day as above, the entire cargo Tabasco mahogany, ex Christine.\nThe sale was well attended, a great many good buyers being present.\nThe cargo was of excellent quality.\nNearly the half was disposed of at prices varying from 11d. to 11d.; one or two\n\nlots fetched 1s., according to quality and size of logs.\nThe cargo consisted of 284 logs, and 126 curls.\nMessrs. James Duncan and Co., exposed for sale on the 28th at their yard, Assembly Street, various wood goods.\nNotwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, there was a very fair attendance.\nThe sale, owing to the continuation of rain, was commenced in the Auction Sale-room, where a few lots were sold of—\nYellow pine deals @ 3s. 1d. per cubic foot.\nCrown Petersburg white, 9 x 3 2 1/4d. per running foot.\n„ „ „ 7 x 2 1/2 1 1/2d.\nFlooring, 1s. 3d. per yard.\nUltimately the whole sale was postponed, there being no appearance of the rain ceasing.\nThe sale will now take place on the 11th prox., commencing in their yard, Seafield, thereafter at Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co., will sell by auction on the 4th prox., on the Quay Head of Queen's Docks, red and white deals and battens.\nFREIGHTS.—Cronstadt to Leith, 47s. is offered for immediate shipment.\nWyborg „ 50s. „ „\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From August 16th to 29th.\nHewn Timber (loads).\nRussia—5,194 Burt & Co.\n1,111 Gabriel & Sons.\n902 Kidman & Kinloch.\n392 Churchill & Sim.\n510 Jordeson & Co.\n450 M.
