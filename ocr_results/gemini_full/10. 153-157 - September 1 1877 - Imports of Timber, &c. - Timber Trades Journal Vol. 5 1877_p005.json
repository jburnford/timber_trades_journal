yet this does not appear to be considered an inducement to purchase where there is no certainty that stocks can be turned over to early advantage.\nWith the exception, probably, of some of the styles received coastwise, supplies have been crowded towards this market, fully openly in others, and selections are by no means difficult.\nCurrent indications, however, seem to show a decreasing anxiety among interior sellers to further force their goods to a sale, with a tendency in prices to become somewhat steadier on desirable assortments.\nIn brief, for the time being the market is dull and a little tame, but prospectively looks rather more encouraging.\n\nTHE SAGINAW VALLEY.\n(*From the \"Lumberman's Gazette,\" August 8th.*)\nThough trade has been middling fair thus far this month, there has yet been nothing to foreshadow that era of brisk sales and advanced profits which many have predicted will be experienced after the marketing of this year's bountiful harvest begins.\nA goodly number of transfers have been made, and the usual number of buyers are on the way with buyer and seller apart as to terms or qualities, and a good deal of talk is required even on small trades, so that while we are all looking hopefully for the advent of better times, which the bright crop prospects seem to indicate, we shall be obliged to date its arrival some time after August 8, 1877, though how tardily it will be in coming is one of those things that no fellow can find out.\nThe log supply still holds out well, and aside from the 29,000,000 on the Au Gres, and 10,000,000 on the Kawkawlin there are no very large amounts in the Valley that drive securing, and in a couple of weeks more we will be able to give a very correct statement of the available stock which may be relied upon from the Saginaw country.\n\nCHICAGO.\n(*From the \"North-western Lumberman,\" August 9th.*)\nThe cargo market is about as dull as it can well be.\nIt is not from a surfeit of lumber either, as the receipts are about 30,000,000 feet less than last year.\nIt is to be hoped in the interest of the market that people will soon recover from the bad influence of the recent disturbance to trade and traffic, and begin to buy, as it is well known they must sooner or later.\n\nTHE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.\n(*From the \"Lumberman and Manufacturer,\" August 9th.*)\nThe conclusion of so glorious a harvest as the farmers of the West have secured has given a decided upward tendency to all branches of business and manufactures, it being understood that all other kinds of trade save the lumber business is subject to periods of briakness and prosperity.\nIn this particular line no changes worthy of note have occurred, and none are expected to occur very soon.\nIn the West the situation may be briefly summed up, that Chicago is not only so certain of her ability to make up the eight hundred or a thousand million feet shortage on this river, but seems to be afraid of the surplus left on hand, so that no steps looking to an advance in prices there seem to have any visible effect, while in the Valley generally there can be no change until after Chicago moves.\nMeanwhile the sawing progresses slowly, some of the firms sawing less than they sell, so that the stocks are worse broken than at the commencement of the manufacturing season, to say nothing of the absence of dry stock and the want of common.\nSmall preparation is being made for the coming winter's logging operations, but not enough to indicate the extent of the cut, most of the loggers being very reticent on the subject of their intentions.\nAltogether the worst thing now to be anticipated is that the loggers on the Chippewa, Black, and St. Croix Rivers will resolve to go in for a large cut, and so accumulate a large surplus for next season, with the large quantities of logs now hung up on these streams.\nThe general business of the city, especially the manufacturing, seems to be progressing satisfactorily.\n\nQUEBEC.\n(*From Messrs. J. Bell, Forsyth, and Co.'s Circular, August 17th.*)\nThe past fortnight has been one of great inactivity until within the past few days, when there has been more inquiry and some transactions.\nWHITE PINE.—A raft of Ottawa pine, 51 feet 15 inches, brought 18 cents, and within the last two days some four rafts have changed hands at prices which have not yet transpired.\nThe demand is chiefly for timber of choice and good quality.\nWe have also to report a sale of Michigan waney, 21 inches; the price has not been made known.\nRed Pine. We have no recent sales to note.—Oak. Some transactions reported at about our quotations.—Elm. We hear of no sales.—Staves. Pipe and W.O.W.I. at quotations.—Deals. No recent sales.—Freights. To Liverpool, 28s., Clyde, 26s., London, 30s., and 77s. 6d. for deals.\n\nShipping Intelligence.\nSOUND LIST.\n(*A record compiled from Lloyd's List of all Timber-laden vessels bound to the United Kingdom passing through the Sound from August 7 to August 27.*)\nAug.
