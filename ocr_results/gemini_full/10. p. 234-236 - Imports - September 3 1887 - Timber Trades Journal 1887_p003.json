E., shipbuilder, Exmouth.—This debtor attended at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Daw, for public examination. In reply to questions debtor said he had only received £1,520, and not £2,000, for two trawlers that he built. That money he paid in wages and in meeting bills. The books were deposited with Mr. Fewings and without them he could not make out a cash statement. He bought a house before he built the trawlers, but that was mortgaged. The mortgagees were Messrs. Blackmore & Crouch. No opposition being offered debtor was allowed to pass his public examination. The following are the creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nAshford W., timber merchant, Dartmouth ... 63 15 3\nBaxter T., 148, Minories, London ... ... 10 0 8\nDay F., Topsham ... ... ... ... 31 15 7\nDart W., builder, Crediton, Devon ... ... 40 0 0\nDensham & Co., St. Thomas Street, Exeter ... 64 7 3\nFurze —, timber merchant, Woodbury ... 14 12 3\nGrant W., smith, Exmouth ... ... ... 10 0 0\nHolman & Co., shipbuilders, Topsham ... 10 2 0\nPatten J.

Collins. He stated in his preliminary examination that he had not done business on his own account since February, 1884, but was employed by the mortgagees of his houses in completing them until May, 1885, when he commenced to work and look after contracts for his sons, William and Henry Collins, in which he had no interest, but goods were supplied to him as H. Collins, and hence the present proceedings. He further stated that in 1867 and 1870 he made private arrangements with his creditors, under which compositions of 7s. 6d. and 1s. in the pound respectively were paid (the latter only partially); also that in February, 1884, he was adjudged bankrupt at Croydon, and has not yet obtained his discharge. He now returns his debts at £356 18s. 11d., and assets nil, the following being entered as creditors:—\n\nSEPTEMBER 3, 1887.]\nBrodrick A. (estate of), Goswell Road ... ... 59 0 0\nBagnall & Co.

HENRY, cabinet-maker, 10 and 11, Old Kent Road.—A first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held at the offices of the Official Receiver on Thursday, when the statement of affairs presented showed unsecured creditors £362 18s. 7d., other liabilities on acceptances £98 5s. 1d., expected to rank £83 17s. 1d., total £426 15s. 8d., and assets, stock-in-trade at estimated cost £200, furniture £10, estimated to produce £84, book debts £11 18s. 3d., total £95 18s. 3d., less preferential creditors £19 2s. 8d., net assets £76 15s. 7d., deficiency £350 0s. 1d. The causes of failure are alleged to be bad debts and bad trade. The following is a list of the principal creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nBancroft, Harris, & Co., Milk Street, Bristol ... 52 17 4\nBuckinghamshire Chair Co., Great Marlow ... 22 14 0\nFaxendale & Co., Miller Street Works, Manchester ... ... ... ... ... 10 13 0\nCulverwell R., Penn Street, Bristol ... ... 10 16 0\nClark & Harrison, Victoria Street, Bristol ... 10 0 4\nCollins W. & Son, High Wycombe ... ... 10 15 6\nDickie, Parsons, & Co., merchants, John Street, Bristol ... ... ... ... 32 7 1\nDavies, Clement, & Co., manufacturers, 10, Clement Street, Birmingham ... ... 50 6 5\nGreenway, Clive, Vale, & Co., oil merchants, Loveday Street, Birmingham ... ... 16 3 3\nHowland & Son, High Wycombe ... ... 10 17 0\nMunday S., Holywell Lane, Curtain Road ... 10 2 6\nSprostor —, Wellington Road, Dudley ... ... 12 8 9\nTrice & Chapman, 71, Aldermangate, London 11 0 6\nWilson & Co., 61, Cannon Street, Manchester 10 6 0\nWoodhall —, Laburnum Cottage, Dudley ... 10 0 0\nWall F., Philadelphia Street, Bristol ... ... 23 2 9\nOTHER LIABILITIES.\nSmith L. J., Rose Villa, Great Marlow ... ... 98 5 5\nCOSSEY, GEORGE JAMES, builder, Cossey Villas, Manorville Road, Clapton, E.—The receiving order in this case was made on the petition of Mr. George Willsmer, timber merchant, Walthamstow, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Official Receiver. The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £997 3s. 2d., and debts fully secured £1,052, against assets £227 5s. 10d., consisting chiefly of the surplus from property held as security. The following are the creditors :—\nUNSECURED.\n£ s. d.\nAird & Fons, Lambeth ... ... ... about 250 0 0\nDuncan A. S. D., Queen Victoria Street ... 200 0 0\nDancey—, 110, Cannon Street ... ... 50 0 0\nFraser & Wheeler, Norwich ... ... ... about 13 0 0\nGoodenough —, 6, Great St. Helens ... ... 45 0 0\nHickling —, timber merchant, Ball's Pond Rd. 93 14 0\nJohnson —Chatsworth Road, Lower Clapton 15 0 0\nRosher —, Upper Ground Street, S.E. ... 111 0 0\nSmith Jacob, Loughborough ... ... ... 84 0 0\nWillsmer G., Hoe street, Walthamstow ... 79 18 6\nFULLY SECURED.\nClient of A.

M., 42, Bishopsgate Within ... ... 660 0 0\nThe debtor stated that he commenced business on his own account without capital, about two and a half years ago, at Canning Town, where, with the assistance of the freeholder, he erected six houses, which were sold, also that he subsequently built eight houses (1 to 8, Cossey Villas), the securities held by creditors treated as fully secured consisting of a mortgage on two of the houses and a building agreement in respect of the other six, his interest in which he in February last assigned without consideration. For the purposes of these proceedings and the statement of affairs the debtor has ignored the said assignment. Of the unsecured debts £250 is stated to be for the costs of an action brought by the debtor in respect of an accident sustained by him in 1885, and in which action he was unsuccessful. The debtor, who had already been adjudged bankrupt, made no proposal, and, in the absence of a quorum of creditors, no resolution was passed, the matter accordingly remaining in the hands of the Official Receiver.\nDAWSON, G. M., builder, Broadstairs.—The first meeting of creditors in this case was held before the Official Receiver at the London Bankruptcy Buildings last week. The debts were stated in the accounts at £523 8s. 7d. and the assets at £18 7s. 6d., the following being scheduled as creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nAylesford Pottery Company, York Road, S E. 41 11 3\nBuckley C., Ramsgate ... ... ... ... 33 4 0\nBrewer T., Ramsgate ... ... ... ... 16 6 6\nBlackburn G., Broadstairs ... ... ... 21 10 11\nBritten & Gilson, Southwark ... ... ... 20 19 1\nBraby & Co., Euston Road ... ... ... 68 19 11\nCrundall W. & Co., Ramsgate ... ... ... 184 10 4\nFarmiloe G. & Sons, West Smithfield ... ... 108 8 5\nGoslett A. & Co., Soho Square ... ... 13 16 8\nHiller George, Broadstairs ... ... ... 11 11 0\nHawkins & Co., Old Bailey ... ... ... 10 15 0\nYerbury R.
