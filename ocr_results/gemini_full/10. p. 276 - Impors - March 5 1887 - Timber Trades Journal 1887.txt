FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BEARD, GEORGE HENRY,—builder, Gloucester Street, New Swindon.—The public examination of this debtor was held at the Swindon Bankruptcy Court on the 11th inst., before Mr. Registrar Tombs. Mr. Henry C. Withy represented the estate, Mr. A. E. Withy the debtor. The debtor had been adjudged bankrupt, and an order for summary administration made by the court. The debtor's statement of affairs showed unsecured creditors £73 9s. 7d., less preferential claims, £92 10s. 9d. The deficiency was £164 3s. 3d. and assets £1 1s. The causes of failure were bad trade and debts, and purchase of a stock at higher value than is saleable at New Swindon. The Official Receiver's observations are: "In addition to the debtor's remarks which are believed to be correct, I may observe the debtor was formerly an employe in the Great Western Railway Works till about two years since, when he started on his own account; consequent on lack of business connection and competition in trade, he has fallen into pecuniary difficulties, pressed by creditors." After a brief examination the matter was adjourned till the 17th inst.

GEORGE, JOHN HENRY, builder and hotel-keeper, Pembroke Dock.—This debtor came up for his public examination before Mr. Registrar Owen, at the Pembroke Dock Court. The statement of affairs filed showed liabilities £1,941 15s. 10d., and assets £516 5s., from which £99 17s. 10d. has to be deducted for preferential claims, leaving net assets £416 8s. 1d., and showing a deficiency of £1,525 6s. 11d. The debtor, in reply to the Official Receiver, said he commenced business in 1872, having no capital of his own, but worked on his wife's money. He commenced building houses about the same time as he started the hotel. He took part of a field from Sir Thomas Meyrick for the purpose of building the houses, and kept no account whatever of the transactions in connection with them; but he was certain he lost by the buildings between £400 and £500. The whole of the houses he sold to Mr. William Allen for £1,712 1s. on the 27th November last, and this was when he first became aware of his insolvency. He had not incurred any fresh liabilities since. The debtor underwent a lengthy examination as to his hotel business, and the examination was concluded. The following are creditors:—

CHESSOR & WISHART.—Sheriff Wilson has just given judgment in the Peterhead Sheriff Court in an action of some importance in connection with the bankruptcy of Messrs. Chessor & Wishart, cartwrights, Brucklay. Messrs. J. & F. Japp, wood merchants, Montrose, on the 20th August last, removed an engine belonging to the bankrupt firm, which had been poinded by them for a debt. The Sheriff, however, had granted cessio, and appointed a trustee on the 17th inst., three days previous, and the trustee thereupon raised an action to have Messrs. Japp interdicted from selling or otherwise interfering with the engine, which it was contended belonged to the bankrupt estate. The defenders contended that cessio proceedings did not cut down or supersede legal diligence as a sequestration did; and after hearing parties the Sheriff has just sustained this view. He therefore recalls the interim interdict already granted, and finds the defenders entitled to expenses. In his note the Sheriff indicates that the cessio is merely a distribution of the debtor's movables, and that it does not, like a sequestration, invalidate preferable diligence. Peterhead, for the trustee; Mr. Masson, solicitor, Peterhead, for the defenders.

CURTIS, JOHN, builder and brickmaker, Sutton-on-Hull.—On Monday last, the 28th February, this debtor came up for his public examination, at the Hull Bankruptcy Court, before his Honour Judge Bedwell. Mr. Priestman appeared for the debtor, and the Official Receiver examined. The debtor stated that he commenced business ten or twelve years ago on borrowed capital, and only became aware of his insolvency six or seven weeks ago. He attributed his failure to depreciation of property. The examination was closed.

ETHERINGTON, ALFRED, cabinet-maker, Rumbold's Hill, Midhurst.—The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held at the London Bankruptcy Court, on Tuesday, before Mr. A. Mackintosh (Official Receiver for Brighton). The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £1,284 3s. 3d., of which £1,176 11s. 5d. is expected to rank, and net assets £194 11s. 5d. the deficiency amounting to £982. The Official Receiver's observations are as follows:—The debtor states that he commenced business in 1865, when he, in conjunction with his brother, continued the business which had previously been carried on by his father. It does not appear to be any deed of partnership. In 1872 the brother went out of the business, but upon what terms the debtor says he is unable now to say. The only books kept, ever, now in respect of the partnership are a ledger and a balance due for money borrowed. There is no cash book, and it is impossible to tell from these books how the deficiency has arisen. The debtor states that he is not able to account for it by the fall in value of his business and interest paid on borrowed money. Of the amount scheduled as unsecured, £600 is in respect of borrowed money. In reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor said that he had no offer to make, and it was resolved to adjudicate him bankrupt, the estate, being under £300, will be realised by the Official Receiver. The creditors are:—

GIBBONS, O. T.—An adjourned meeting of the creditors of Mr. O. T. Gibbons, builder and contractor, of the Gipping Works, Ipswich, was held at the Great Eastern Hotel, Liverpool Street, London, on Monday last. Mr. Fredk. Messant, Official Receiver, presided. The debtor was represented by Mr. H. K. Moseley. The Chairman said the meeting would recollect that at the last meeting a committee was appointed to give the matter some consideration whether they could make any suggestion which would prevent the necessity of getting into bankruptcy. The first business of that adjourned meeting would be to receive the report of the committee.
