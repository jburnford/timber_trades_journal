NEW YORK.
(From the “Real Estate Record,” Sept 1st.)
The midsummer lethargy is now passing away to some extent on all articles of merchandise, and our lumber market shares slightly in the tendency to improvement. Buyers commence to inquire more frequently as to values, the location of stocks, and what kind of an assortment will be offered them for selections, and with orders now and then following these researches, sellers naturally feel greater encouragement. It seems quite certain, however, that whatever business takes place will have to be on a conservative basis, and not far from the present fairly adjusted line of values, and even where the position gives evidence of easy control by either buyer or seller. Extreme views very soon react upon those who entertain them. A further shrinkage on cost causes a refusal to sell, and a withdrawal of desirable parcels, while the attempt at a much higher range checks demand and developes substitutes. With the exception of a small portion of the trade who have been for years talking about exhausted supplies, and some remarkable act on the part of manufacturers by which buyers were to be forced to submit to almost anything asked, there is no extravagant view entertained, and if a good fair movement of lumber with a light margin for profit can be secured this fall the satisfaction will be pretty general, as this is all that can reasonably be expected.
