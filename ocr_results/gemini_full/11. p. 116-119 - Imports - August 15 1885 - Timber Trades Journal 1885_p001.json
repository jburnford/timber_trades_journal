The company had, as the shareholders knew, a very large sum of money invested there, and although several proposals had been most carefully considered, no proposal had been brought before the directors of such a character as would enable them to recommend the investment of any further sum of money in that very difficult undertaking.\n\nGLASGOW.\nParcels of deals continue to arrive here per steamers from Quebec and Montreal.\nThe quantity imported since the season began is about the same as during corresponding period last year, viz : 1885, 158,859 pieces, and 1884 163,467 pieces.\nThe Clyde ships engaged in the Quebec log timber trade are slow of arriving at Greenock; the import list for the past week includes one other, making 7 cargoes from Quebec since the season began, as compared with 12 at this time last year.\nThe winds in the Atlantic are reported light and variable, and the passages are therefore longer than usual.\nThe demand at present being restricted by dull trade it is well that the import should be on a correspondingly limited scale, and already it is evident that this year’s import of wood goods to Clyde will, on the whole, be much smaller than the average.\nPitch pine is an important item, and at present it shows about a third under the usual total import at this date.\nA public sale of timber, which was well attended, took place at Greenock on the 6th inst., result as undernoted.\nThere are some oncoming sales of deals, Quebec and lower port, particulars of which we shall forward for next issue.\n\nAUCTION SALE.\nOn 6th inst., at Greenock, Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Hamilton, brokers :—\nQuebec waney boardwood— Per. c. ft.\n80 logs 50 c. ft. avg. per log 2s. 4d.\n20 „ 46 „ „ 1s. 11d.\n20 „ „ „ 1s. 9d.\nQuebec yellow pine—\n35 c. ft. avg. per log 1s. 6d.\nQuebec 1st yellow pine deals—\n9 ft. 7/16 x 3 2s. 6½d.\nQuebec 2nd yellow pine ends—\n6 to 8 ft. 7/21 x 3 2s. 0½d.\nQuebec 4th yellow pine deals—\n14 ft. 7/19 x 3 11½d.\n18 to 28 „ 12/21 x 3 11½d.\n13 „ 7/19 x 3 11d.\n12 „ 7/24 x 3 11d.\n15 to 17 „ 7/19 x 3 11d.\n9 to 11 „ 7/20 x 3 9½d.\n\nLEITH.\nThere is again a full list of arrivals of wood-laden vessels to record this week, including besides a number of sailers from Norwegian, Swedish, and Russian ports, and sundry considerable parcels by the regular steamers, two entire steamer cargoes from Cronstadt.\nNotwithstanding the bustle, which the numerous arrivals occasion at the docks there is no sympathetic improvement to record in the actual sales this week.\nAt the public sale held by Messrs. A. Garland & Roger, on Tuesday, Mr. James Thomson (Messrs. William Thomson & Co.) acted as broker, and although the attendance of buyers was small at first, there was a fair company before the close; but the same slackness of demand as on the previous occasion characterized the whole proceedings.\nThe goods first offered were a parcel of Abo redwood boards 4 and 5 x 1 and 1½, which were sold for shipper’s account at 4½d. to 6d. per cubic foot unprecedentedly low prices.\nSome Abo whitewood battens and scantlings were then tried, and some quantity sold, but prices, although very much better than those got for the red boards, were not encouraging.\nVarious other goods were then offered including Skonvik red deals and Lulea red battens, but the exposer’s limits not being reached the goods were withdrawn.\nThe broker afterwards put up the parcel of St. Petersburg whitewood 11 x 3 deals consigned to his own firm, and cleared out a fair proportion of them at 2 1/8d. to 3d. per lineal foot for 1st quality, and 2 1/8d. for 2nd quality, which seemed good prices considering the quality of the shipment.\n\n“CARBOLINEUM AVENARIUS.”\nTHIS is the registered name of a German wood preservative against rotting, decay, &c., introduced into this country by Messrs. Peters, Bartsch, & Co., Derby.\nIt would appear that the action of this preservative is of a twofold character, mechanical and chemical.\nIn the first case, by reason of its specific gravity it expels the water from the capillary channels and prevents it from afterwards penetrating the wood, the fatty oils contained in the preservative also protecting the wood from atmospherical influences, such as dampness, &c.\nIf the preservative is applied hot—say at a boiling point—it will evaporate the water and the vacuum thus caused will naturally facilitate impregnation.\nThe chemical action of “Carbolineum Avenarius” is found in its antiseptic nature.\nIt consists of 20 per cent. of antiseptic bodies which are said to have the effect of coagulating all nitrogenous substances.\nIn itself a green colour, it also turns to a nut-brown after exposure to the air.\nThe inventors, therefore, claim for “Carbolineum Avenarius” that it fulfills all the conditions of an efficient preservative of wood against all injurious influences, both external and internal.\nBeing very thin and liquid, it readily soaks into the wood; insects avoid wood treated with it; it is easily applied with a brush, requiring no skill in handling; it is also a good remedy against house-fungus, and is therefore is recommended for buildings in damp situations and humid climates.\nIt may be applied for beams, floors, wainscoting, wooden ornaments, cellar doors, floorings, roofs, &c.; for wooden implements, carts, waggons, wooden structures, sleepers, telegraph poles, fences, &c.; for landing-stages, bridges, &c.; for all woodwork on boardship, life-buoys, boats, &c.; for all timber under ground; and for the impregnation of hemp ropes in order to impart greater durability to the its.\nAnother recommendation is its cheapness, its cost being less than that of liquid tar.\nAs bearing out this assertion, the inventors instance large gasworks in Northern Germany, who, though producing tar as a secondary article, yet prefer to use “Carbolineum Avenarius.”\nA large number of firms on the Continent is now using this preservative, and they all speak highly of it, though we ourselves have not put it to the test of any considerable length of time.\nWe have, however, bearing in mind the utility of a good and cheap wood preservative, pleasure in calling our readers’ attention to “Carbolineum Avenarius,” which we hope will meet with a success commensurate with its merits.\nThe London offices of Messrs. Peters, Bartsch, & Co. are at 30, Great St. Helen’s, E.C.\n\nOPEN CONTRACTS FOR WOOD.\nSLEEPERS.—The Barry Dock and Railways Company require tenders for the supply and delivery at Cardiff or Penarth of 20,000 sleepers, 40,000 keys, 7,000 tons rails, 4,000 tons chairs, 346 tons fish plates, 84 tons fish bolts, 634 tons sleeper bolts.\nTenders to be delivered by August 20th, to the secretary, Mr. G. C. Downing, Vienna Chambers, Bute Docks, Cardiff.\nBRIDGWATER DOCK.—In September next this dock will be cleared of vessels and remain closed for about six weeks, in order to erect new gates and remove the large accumulation of mud in the dock and tidal basin.\nCART MARKING.—This ancient custom takes place twice a year in the City of London.\nLast week the summer cart marking came to a close.\nCarmen, who pay 5s. a year, have their vehicles branded by a Corporation servant.\nThese carmen have certain privileges.\nThey may stand about in certain City thoroughfares, and are hired by warehousemen and others much in the same way that cabmen are hired from their stands.\nLUBECK.—The timber trade is the most important of all the different branches of commerce at Lubeck.\nIt has become so important through the energy and activity of the timber merchants, who have extended their market in Germany by the erection of expensive sawmills and planing machines.\nThis enterprise has given a great impulse to the industry of the town.\nThe joiners are now able to send furniture and boxes to the interior; the high duty on imported planed and sawn timber before prevented them from doing so.\n\nIMPORTS.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved. Imports of mahogany, &c., appear under the heading “Hardwoods” on another page.—ED.]\n\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nABERYSTWITH.\nAug. 8 Holzer Danske—Fredrikstad—14,207 flooring boards—Jones & Griffiths\nBARROW-IN-FURNESS.\nAug. 4 Constantine—Stettin—856 pcs. hewn birch, 468 pcs. hewn pine and spruce, 3,539 spruce deals, scantlings, and ends—Price, Potter, & Co.\nAgra—Sheet Harbour, N.S.—21,514 deals, battens, and ends—Price, Potter, & Co.\nFrans—Gefle—165,323 deals and boards—Crossfield\n5 Cydonia (s)—Pensacola—2,192 pcs. sawm pitch pine, 2,194 fir deals, 1,000 staves—Price, Potter, & Co.\nEuphemia—Gefle—516 pcs. planed fir boards—Price, Potter, & Co.\n10 Paramatta—St. John—10,000 deals, battens, scantlings, boards—Price, Potter, & Co.\n10 Plymouth—Buctouche—21,139 deals, battens, scantlings, and ends—Price, Potter, & Co.\nIndustrie—Sheet Harbour—18,597 deals, battens, and ends—Price, Potter, & Co.\nBERWICK-ON-TWEED.\nAug. 10 Kingscote (s)—Memel—9,150 sleepers—Calder & Co.\nBrackley (s)—Memel—7,150 sleepers—Calder & Co.\nBOSTON.\nAug. 6 Phonix—Arendal—1,643 pcs. mining timber—Beeby & Son\n8 Emblem—Westervik—1,251 pcs. fms. firewood—Lockwood\nBRIDGWATER.\nAug. 4 Edward Windsor—Fredrikstad—15,033 boards, 675 deals, 119 bdls. slating laths—Colthurst & Co.\nBRISTOL.\nAug. 6 Gimle—Parrsboro’, N.S.—12,461 deals, battens, &c.—May & Hassell\nRana—Archangel—5,240 deals and ends—Jones & Nash\nSomerset (s)—Montreal—33,970 deals—Taylor & Co.\nReginald—Waterford—100 bags cut timber—Gibbons, Sinnock, & Co.\nAug. 11 Tjomo—Bay Verte—18,490 deals, 1,000 deal ends—Taylor & Co.\n12 Pontiac—Quebec—14,385 pine deals, 1,888 pine deal ends—Jones & Co.\nCARDIFF.\nAug. 4 Europa—Sundswall—1,800 pcs. sawn fir, 192 deals and boards—Order\nRosa—Christiansand—364 lds. pit-props—Jones, Heard, & Ingram\nAlexander II.—La Rochelle—25,290 deals and ends—Order\nProsperité—Bordeaux—60 lds. pitwood—Order\nVolzy—Bordeaux—130 lds. pitwood—Order\nAnge Gardien—Lorient—120 lds. pitwood—Order\nCalypso—Bordeaux—340 lds. pitwood—Order\nMaria Distrup—Bordeaux—370 lds. pitwood—Fry, Holman, & Fry\nJulio—Muros—320 lds. pit-props—Manzanos\nBravo—Riga—25,147 pcs. lathwood—Trayes\nFernina—Corunna—300 lds. pit-props—Manzanos, Cristobal, & Co.\nCapella—Hallsta—18,824 deals, battens, and boards—Grimes & Co.\nTeresa Olivari—St. John—25,290 deals and ends—Morris & Smith\n5 Marie Henry—Bordeaux—65 lds. pitwood—Order\nL.
