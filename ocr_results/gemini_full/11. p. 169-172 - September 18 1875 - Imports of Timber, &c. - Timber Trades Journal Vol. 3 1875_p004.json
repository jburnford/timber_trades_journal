The extensive timber-yard of Messrs. Wm. Oliver & Sons, an acre in extent, and containing great quantities of mahogany, deals, veneers and other timber, although adjoining the buildings destroyed, has fortunately escaped without serious injury. Mr. Walker's premises covered a large area. The factory was 100 feet square, and the interior into show-rooms, stock-rooms, and workshops. A large number of workpeople were daily employed there in furniture making, and the premises were well stocked with goods, made principally of pine. The origin of the fire is unknown. The neighbouring factories were greatly damaged, and the total loss amounts to many thousand pounds. The insurance is in the Phoenix, Kent, Sun, Royal Exchange and other offices. Messrs. Oliver & Sons, state that their premises have been but slightly injured in comparison, and that their business will in no way be interfered with.",
