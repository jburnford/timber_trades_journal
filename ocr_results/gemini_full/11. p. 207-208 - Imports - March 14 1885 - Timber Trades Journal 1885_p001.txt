MARCH 14, 1885.

understand that the average contents of the logs are 100 ft.
The Pensacola cargo of sawn pitch pine discharging for Messrs. Bennetts & Co., so far as can be seen, is a very fine parcel ; it is noticed in the local press as follows:—
“ANOTHER LARGE AMERICAN SHIP.—The Lillie Soullard, of Yarmouth, N.S., has arrived with a large cargo of pitch pine for Messrs. Bennetts. The vessel is 1,000 tons register, and will discharge in the Alexandra Dock. The agents are T. & S. Oates, our old Grimsby firm.”
There is little change to report in the attitude of trade. A considerable business has been done in buying goods for spring and summer import, and contracts are being steadily made with inland firms.
The trade from stock is very dull and languid, orders are few in number and very difficult to obtain, buyers confining themselves to their special requirements.
GLASGOW.
The demand for timber during the week has been limited. An auction sale took place at Greenock on the 5th inst., particulars of which are noted below. A longer interval than usual had elapsed since the previous sale held there, none having been called last month, and this has evidently been of benefit to the market.
There was a fair attendance at the under-noted sale, and extent of transactions showed improvement compared with recent auction at Greenock. Part of the wood was put up without reserve.
Imports to Clyde during the week comprise a cargo of teak, one of pitch pine, and sundry parcels of wood goods per steam liners. These include thirteen logs black walnut, the supply of which has been very meagre of late, and the market is bare.
A cargo of Mexican mahogany, we learn, is daily expected here, having been ordered from port of call.

LEITH.
One or two cargoes of deals and battens have arrived during the past week, but the imports are still very light. A good quantity of Baltic goods have been contracted for by merchants in this vicinity, but it must be remembered that stocks are by no means heavy at present in this district. Trade is still in a rather languid condition, but many profess to see prospects of a speedy improvement.
A considerable portion of the trade in the district is now carried on by means of public sales, a week rarely passing without one and sometimes two; this week, however, has been an exception, as there has been no sale. Notwithstanding the little encouragement received by the exposers at the last auction sale, several are announced ; the effect of this will certainly not help to maintain prices among consumers.

THE WORLD'S Industrial and Cotton Exposition AT NEW ORLEANS.
THIS INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION should be seen by all who can spare the time. No visitor is ever likely to forget his impressions of the magnificent Corliss Engines which give motion to 10,600 feet of shafting, or of the marvellous ease with which the enormous power they develop is transmitted by the IMMENSE BELTS. As the huge fair is, above everything, an Exposition of Cotton Manufacture in the greatest cotton-growing district of the world, it is in keeping with “the eternal fitness of things” that these ENORMOUS BELTS should also be of cotton. Four of the large engines are supplied with them, the largest belt being SIXTY INCHES WIDE.—[See New Orleans “Times-Democrat” of 17th December.] It is an interesting fact that the Americans were the first to adopt the transmission of power from the engine by the means of belts, as also the first to use Cotton Belts, which are now by universal testimony conceded to be superior to every other kind. THESE FOUR LARGE COTTON BELTS were made specially for this great Exposition by
THE GANDY BELTING COMPANY,
BALTIMORE, LONDON, LIVERPOOL, PARIS, HAMBURG, AND VIENNA.
