A few orders still exist for chartering from the Baltic. The mining timber trade is, perhaps, in as unsatisfactory a condition as it has been at any time, and things appear to be going from bad to worse week by week. As regards French pit-props also, we are sorry to record a dull market as to prices, 14s. ex ship is to-day about the highest selling price, with an average supply.\n\nGLASGOW.\nDeliveries of wood goods have of late been going on pretty freely ; compared with last year's they show a decided increase on the whole, and give evidence of improvement in trade. The quantity of deals (Quebec and lower ports) delivered from Yorkhill yards during the last three months shows an increase of fully 25 per cent. over that of the corresponding period of last year. There has, however, been an ample importation of Quebec deals to Clyde this year, and the market is at present well supplied, especially with the lower grades, which have constituted the bulk of the arrivals, the stock of fine quality being comparatively small.\nAltogether there have been landed at Glasgow this year, ex steamer from Quebec and Montreal, 247,156 pieces deals and planks, and ex sailing vessels from Quebec, including imports at Greenock and Bowling, there have been 166,702 pieces.\nThe Clyde import list of the past week includes a cargo of teak timber, arrivals of which have been on a moderate scale this year. It is consigned to Messrs. Thomson & Gray.\nThe small stock of birch timber held here has been slightly augmented by an arrival of 400 logs per *Vera*, from Campbellton, N.S., to Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co. Better prices for birch are now ruling than was the case at this time last year, when the stock was considerably larger.\n\nAUCTION SALE.\nMessrs. Allison, Cousland, & Hamilton held a sale here on 8th inst., at which an attractive variety of wood goods was offered, the catalogue comprising U.S. black walnut, Austrian oak and wainscot, Pictou birch and maple, and an extensive assortment of Quebec pine deals, spruce deals, &c.\nThe sale was begun at Queen's Dock with the log timber; there was a good company present.\nA parcel of 44 logs U.S. black walnut (from Baltimore), containing 1,318 cub. feet, 19 1/4 in. average square, sold at 2s. 3d. to 6s., averaging 4s. 3d.\nAnother parcel of 73 logs walnut, from Baltimore, just landed, about 16 3/4 in. average square, sold at 3s. to 5s. 1d., averaging about 3s. 11d.\nThe walnut catalogued was all cleared out:—\n100 logs Austrian wainscot oak (from Fiume), 17 to 20 cub. feet per log, brought 3s. 4d. to 3s. 8d. per cub. foot.\n20 logs Austrian oak at 1s. 5d. per cub. foot.\n6 logs hickory (Baltimore) 18 1/2 in. average square, at 1s. 9d.\nOf the birch timber only a small proportion changed hands, offers not meeting exposers' views. Birch is now held for advanced rates, stock of fresh import being very light.\nAfter luncheon at Queen's Dock the company proceeded to Yorkhill, where the deals were then offered.\nUndernoted were sales made publicly and some lots changed hands privately at the close of the auction.\nQuebec 1st yellow pine deals—\n12/14 ft. 9/10x3 2s. 2 1/2d. per cub. ft.\n10 & 11 ft. 11/26x3 2s. 2 1/2d. ,,\n13 ft. 9x3 2s. 1 1/2d. ,,\n11 ft. 8/10x3 2s. ,,\nQuebec 3rd yellow pine deals—\n10 ft. 12/21x3 1s. ,,\n16 ft. 9x3 10d. ,,\nQuebec 4th yellow pine deals—\n15 & 16 ft. 12/22x3 11d. ,,\n12 ft. 18/27x3 11d. ,,\n12 ft. 10x3 11d. ,,\n14 ft. 12/21x3 10d. ,,\n12 ft. 14/15x3 9 1/2d. ,,\n12 ft. 13x3 9 1/2d. ,,\n10 & 11 ft. 12/26x3 9d. ,,\n\nQuebec 2nd spruce deals— Per cub. ft.\n14 & 16 ft. 10x3 10d.\n16 ft. 9x3 9 1/2d. ,,\n\nLEITH.\nThe arrivals of wood goods during the past week have been heavier, and comprise, in addition to some considerable shipments of deals and battens from Archangel, Cronstadt, and Namsos, the *Maria Cichero*, from Pensacola, with sawn pitch pine timber for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co., and the *Deodata*, from Quebec, with waney board pine and hardwoods consigned to Mr. D. W. Beattie. The excessively wet weather of the last seven days has been against business, and has seriously interfered with the satisfactory landing and piling of the various cargoes discharging.\nMessrs. A. Garland & Roger held a public sale of American and Baltic wood goods at their yard, Bath Road, on Tuesday, 6th inst. There was a fairly numerous company, but the state of the weather prevented much being done. Not to disappoint buyers the greater part of the goods advertised were gone over by the broker (Mr. D. W. Beattie) and a number of lots sold, but ultimately it was announced that the sale would be postponed until Saturday, 10th inst. when it is to be hoped the weather will be more propitious. For what was sold the following prices were got :—\nwaney board pine, 2s. to 2s. 2d. per cub. foot.\n4th quality yellow pine deals, 10 1/2d. to 11d. per cubic foot.\n11x3 red deals 3d. to 3 1/2d. per lin. ft.\n9x3 ,, ,, 2d. ,, 2 1/4d. ,,\n11x3 white ,, 2 1/2d. ,, 3d. ,,\n9x3 ,, ,, 1 3/4d. ,, 1 7/8d. ,,\n6 1/2x2 1/2 ,, battens 7/8d. ,, 1d. ,,\n6x2 ,, ,, 1 1/8d. ,, 1 3/8d. ,,\n4x2 ,, ,, 1 5/8d. ,, 1 3/4d. ,,\n6x1 1/2 ,, flooring 10 1/4d. ,, 10 3/4d. p. sup. yd.\n8x5/8 ,, sarking 6d. ,, 6 1/4d. ,,\n\nTHE SURREY COMMERCIAL DOCK COMPANY.\nThe forty-sixth ordinary half-yearly meeting of the shareholders of the Surrey Commercial Dock Company was held on Thursday, at the offices of the company, 106, Fenchurch Street; Mr. Charles Churchill, chairman of the board of directors, presiding.\nThe Chairman, in moving the adoption of the report, said they were fortunate in being in a better position than docks on the other side of the river. The company still paid a fair dividend, and the directors were confident that it would continue to be earned. They had pursued the policy of keeping down the capital, and defraying out of revenue the cost of extensive improvements which were now bearing fruit and contributing largely to their profits. They were no longer so dependent on the wood trade as had been the case in the past. They, like other companies, were passing through a time of anxiety, in consequence of the bad trade, and everyone wanted to get the charges reduced. They had a good deal of competition to encounter. The Millwall Dock Company allowed 30 per cent. off the Surrey Dock Company's charges as an inducement to people to send goods into their docks. He was, therefore, surprised, under these circumstances, they had been able to keep so much of their business. Their geographical position was, however, a good one, and the opening of the Tower Bridge would, he believed, add to their prospects financially. Another form of competition was the taking of goods overside, but he thought that practice would not continue, and that, as formerly, goods would be warehoused. He also thought that the Millwall Dock Company would get tired of conducting the wood trade at a loss. They possessed 400 acres of dock, whilst their capital only amounted to a million and a half sterling. This was a position no other dock company near London could show. Their charges also compared very favourably with those obtaining in other large towns. He had such confidence in the future of the company that he had recently largely increased his holding in it.\nThe motion was seconded by Mr. D. J. Morgan, the deputy chairman.\nA shareholder said he noticed that although there was an increase in the coal tonnage it was a very trifling one. He would be glad to know what the amalgamation schemes, that were under consideration were.\nThe Chairman said the amount of coal they received into their dock depended almost entirely upon the South Metropolitan Gas Company. The board knew nothing of any amalgamation schemes. They had heard people talk of amalgamation with the St. Katharine and West India Dock Companies,\n34\n\nSEPTEMBER 10, 1887.\nbut the board themselves had not heard of any scheme.\nThe motion was then agreed to, and a dividend as recommended in the report, at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, having been declared, the proceedings closed.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nABERYSTWITH.\nSept. 1 Petrel-Economy Point, Nova Scotia-54 pcs. hewn fir-A.
