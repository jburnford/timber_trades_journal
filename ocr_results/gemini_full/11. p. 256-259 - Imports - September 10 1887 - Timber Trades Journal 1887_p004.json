Preferential creditors 2s. 6d., net assets £19 17s. 6d., deficiency £567 13s. 6d. The failure is attributed by debtor to pressure by a creditor who holds a mortgage and deed of attornment to secure advances and interest, and losses on building two trawlers under a contract.\nBUSK, CHARLES WESTLY, contract r, Blackheath. — On Tuesday last, at the Greenwich Court, the debtor in this matter attended to pass his adjourned public examination before Colonel W. Bristow, Deputy-Registrar. A legal gentleman was now present on behalf of the debtor, who said that Mr. McGee was a gentleman employed by his client's father to go out and thoroughly investigate the affairs of his son. He went very thoroughly into the matter, and had made a very able report. The Deputy Official Receiver agreed that it was an able report, and on the solicitor promising to supply a copy of it the Official Receiver (Mr. Shirtcliffe) said he would not further oppose the debtor's passing. The debtor then swore to the usual memoranda on the file, and was then informed that he had passed his public examination.\nCASEY, E. W., cabinet-maker, Southampton. The sitting for the public examination of this debtor was held at the Southampton Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, before Mr. Deputy Registrar Robbins. Mr. J. C. Moberley, Official Receiver, represented the estate, and briefly examined the debtor with reference to his financial transactions with his brother. The debtor attributes his failure entirely to the liabilities he had undertaken on behalf of his brother. The liabilities amounted to £78, and the different bills were signed by himself, John Casey, and H. Willis. There being no opposition the debtor was allowed to pass his public examination.\nCOLLINS, ARTHUR GORDON, builder, &c., Westgate-on-Sea.—In this matter the debtor attended before Mr. Registrar Furley,\n37\n\n259\n\non Friday last, to pass his public examination, which has now been in abeyance for some considerable time, the receiving order having been made against the debtor in 1886. The debtor made an offer, and resolutions were passed for bankruptcy. Mr. George Cloake was appointed trustee with a committee of inspection. The debtor, it appeared, married in July, 1886, and settled certain houses and furniture on his wife, but as it was alleged that he was then in difficulties, an endeavour was made to set aside the deed of settlement. Mr. Minter, who now appeared for the trustee, reported that the judge had upheld the settlement on the application to set it aside. The debtor was allowed to pass.\nCOSSY, G. J., builder, Cossey Villas, Mandeville Road, Clapton, E.—This case has been previously reported, and the meeting for the bankrupt's public examination was held on Tuesday before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The receiving order was made upon the petition of Mr. George Willsmer, timber merchant, Walthamstow, and the bankrupt furnished accounts showing unsecured debts £997 3s. 2d., and debts fully secured £1,052 ; against assets £227 5s. 10d., consisting chiefly of the surplus from property held as security. Mr. Tanner appeared for the Official Receiver, Mr. Williams (the petitioning creditor) opposed in person, and upon his application the bankrupt was ordered to file further accounts, his examination being adjourned for that purpose.\nCURTIS, RICHARD, builder and contractor, 100, Aldersgate Street, E.C.—The bankrupt, trading as Curtis & Co., applied on Tuesday to pass his public examination. The case has been already reported in the Timber Trades Journal, and the accounts showed unsecured liabilities £3,348 14s. 5d., and debts fully secured £3,594 10s., with assets (surplus from securities) £2,490 5s. Mr. Tanner represented the Official Receiver. The bankrupt passed his examination.\nDAWSON, G. M., builder, Broadstairs, Kent.—The public examination in this matter took place on Friday last before Mr. Registrar Forley and Mr. J. T. Welldon, who appeared on behalf of Mr. Leslie Creery, the Official Receiver for the district. The debtor was now examined at some length upon his trading and financial position prior to his failure, and the examination was again adjourned.\nHUGHAN, HUGH, builder, Church Road, St. Annes-on-Sea, and 3, The Grove, Acomb Street, Chorlton-upon-Medlock, Manchester. — The statement of affairs in this recent failure shows unsecured creditors amounting to £713 1s. 6d.

Sharp). Mr. Pinsent (Barlow, Smith, & Pinsent) appeared as solicitor to the debtors, two only of whom attended, a medical certificate being put in stating that Hubert Joseph Horsley was too ill to leave his house. Mr. M. A. Fitter and Mr. Allen Edwards represented several large creditors, and a good number of creditors attended in person. The statement of affairs of the partnership estate showed—unsecured liabilities £2,704 16s. 8d., in addition to secured debts £4,216 19s. 8d., assets £2,220 16s. 5d., consisting of stock-in-trade, plant, &c., £1,566 13s., book debts (estimated to produce) £674 2s. 4d.
