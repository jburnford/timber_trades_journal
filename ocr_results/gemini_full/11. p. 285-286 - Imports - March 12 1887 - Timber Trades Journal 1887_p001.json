The plan has been most enthusiastically taken up by those concerned, and at least two-thirds of the necessary sum subscribed towards the total capital of the concern. At least, the new organisation starts with good supporters, as its earliest subscribers are the leading provision merchants of the Metropolis. It is likely that in the near future the business of these merchants may be increased in consequence of the enlarged import of American provisions through the port of London, as a result of the increased facilities for delivery.\"\nWhat contrast between this and the want of spirit shown by the timber trade!—Yours truly,\nVENI VIDI,—\n\nLONDON DOCK DELIVERIES.\nDeliveries at the Docks for the week ending March 5th, 1887, compared with the corresponding period of 1886, and also for the nine weeks ending March 5th compared with the corresponding period of 1886.\n\nSURREY COMMERCIAL DOCKS.\n1887. 1886.\nstds. stds.\nDeals from stock ... ... 2,885 3,372\nPrepared boards ... ... 791 569\nTotal 3,676 3,941\nDeals from ship direct to craft for storage elsewhere than at the docks ... ... — —\nPrepared boards ... ... — —\nTotal 3,676 3,941\nFloated timber ... loads 972 1,224\n\nMILLWALL DOCKS.\n1887. 1886.\nstds. stds.\nDeals from stock ... ... 372 145\nPrepared boards ... ... 86 35\nTotal 458 180\nDeals from ship direct to craft for storage elsewhere than at the docks ... ... — 36\nPrepared boards ... ... 85 20\nTotal 543 236\n\nDELIVERIES FROM BOTH DOCKS\nFOR THE WEEK ENDING MARCH 5TH.\n1887. 1886.\nstds. stds.\nDeals ... ... ... 3,257 3,553\nPrepared boards ... ... 942 624\nTotal 4,199 4,177\nFloated timber ... loads 972 1,224\nFOR THE NINE WEEKS ENDING MARCH 5TH.\n1887. 1886.\nstds. stds.\nDeals ... ... ... 27,839 28,023\nPrepared boards ... ... 6,717 5,238\nTotal 34,556 33,261\nFloated timber ... loads 7,985 9,252\n\nDIFFERENCE (INCLUDING BOTH DOCKS)\nOn the one week.\nDeals stds. 296 ... decrease for 1887.\nPrepared boards „ 318 ... increase „\nFloated timber, lds. 252 ... decrease „\nOn the nine weeks.\nDeals stds. 184 ... decrease „\nPrepared boards „ 1,479 ... increase „\nFloated timber, lds. 1,267 ... decrease „\n17\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
