CORRESPONDENCE
THE OLDEST FIRM IN THE TIMBER TRADE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—We notice in your last week's issue a letter asking which is the oldest firm in the timber trade. From the above heading* you will see we have been established much longer than the firms mentioned, and perhaps, as long as any in the country.—We are, sir, yours truly,

A TIMBER EXCHANGE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—I beg to enclose extract from a daily paper which has just met my eye:—
"A PRODUCE EXCHANGE."
"The merchants of London engaged in the provision trade have found it necessary to form for the purpose of their business an exchange in which may be transacted their various branches of business. The plan has been most enthusiastically taken up by those concerned, and at least two-thirds of the necessary sum subscribed towards the total capital of the concern. At least, the new organisation starts with good supporters, as its earliest subscribers are the leading provision merchants of the Metropolis. It is likely that in the near future the business of these merchants may be increased in consequence of the enlarged import of American provisions through the port of London, as a result of the increased facilities for delivery."
What contrast between this and the want of spirit shown by the timber trade!—Yours truly,
VENI VIDI,—
