SEPTEMBER 19, 1874.
Timber Trade Reports.
LONDON.
September 18th, 1874.
The same lassitude pervades the market here, and there has been only limited business transacted, while during the last week the few contracts that have been entered into are at prices that a few months ago would have been considered by shippers absurdly low. Meanwhile there is little that is encouraging in the aspect of things generally, and the prospect of trade reviving is as yet not very promising.
The labour question is coming prominently to the surface again, and a general feeling of uncertainty is apparent all over the country. In the building trade we are glad to state the relations between employers and workmen seem to be on a satisfactory footing at present, but in the coal and iron trades the reverse of this is the case, for there things are looking very serious. In some districts strikes are actually in progress, while in others from certain indications they are very likely to take place, and it is quite useless merchants expecting more life in trade while this state of things continues. We cannot in the face of all this look with any confidence for an early return to the former prices of the present year, and we fear that if any amendment does take place it will not be till the opportunity to profit by it this season has gone by. It is not likely that merchants will buy so freely for next year while the bulk of their last year's purchases are still unsold, and there is small chance of realizing just now at a profit. The market is and has been very unsettled, so that we cannot even now tell what the next month will do towards smoothing the present difficulties, but there is come in for a great deal of what is here to work off, should a brisker demand arise, and a return to its normal state might upset all calculations, and render prices as firm as they are now unsteady.
The more moderate weather of the last few days and a slant of wind from the north and east has brought forward a good fleet of Baltic and Norwegian timber laden vessels to swell the already plentiful supplies here, though as these were mostly the early summer charters and were therefore expected, their effect on the market has been to a considerable extent already discounted, as the merchants would refrain from adding to their stock by fresh purchases in anticipation of their arrival the interim; no doubt by a long spell of adverse winds these goods have missed the best time; in fact, taking into consider-ation the dull state of trade and the lateness of the year, they could not have very well come at a worse period, and may hang on hand some time unless trade soon revives.
The season for chartering is now drawing to a close, and the rates ought to show an upward tendency. There has been a slight improvement already, though a good deal of depression in the market still continues. However, it is a very favourable time for chartering, as the freights are certain to go up more or less after the present month, and if we have a boisterous equinox, fall insurance may become a serious item.
The imports up to the present time to London are not excessive, though for the requirements of the present trade when wharfed, appear large, for the circulation at present is so sluggish; but as there is only a month or two more to ship any considerable quantity in, they are not likely to increase to any great extent, and there will be the entire winter and greater part of the spring to work them off before further arrivals can take place. There is also a fair prospect of the local inquiry becoming brisker if the weather for building is at all favourable this winter.
The new district about to be covered with houses for the working classes by the directors of the Artisans, Labourers, and General Dwellings Company, extending over an area of eighty acres on the Harrow Road and the plans of which are
