NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," Sept. 15th.)
The improvement in the tone and force of the demand makes some progress, and the market shows many little points calculated to encourage the selling interest. There appears to be a portion of the trade who are constantly looking for a sudden spurt, and expansion of business into such magnificent proportions as to exhaust the bulk of available supplies, send prices up with a bound, and generally in short order recover from the depression of the past two or three years; but luckily the number of operators of this mind is small. Accumulations here are comparatively moderate; and must be filled to the extent of winter necessities; the demand for building purposes is a little better at present in prospective, many manufacturing outlets require more stock, some even liberal amounts, and the export movement, though a little irregular on the whole, exhausts a considerable quantity of stuff.
