G. Drinkwater, Parliament Street, Westminster, who is a contractor for public works, and contested the borough of Launceston in 1874, was held in the London Bankruptcy Court on Monday, Mr. H. Brougham, one of the Assistant Official Receivers, presiding. The accounts show fully secured debts £7,319 15s., partly secured £14,647 8s. 11d. (secured to the extent of £5,325), and total expected to rank £18,975 12s. 5d., as against assets of £7,705 9s. 7d.

The proofs having been gone through, Mr. Raphael asked the chairman the character of the powers entrusted to the two principal creditors. This the chairman refused to give, but stated, for the guidance of creditors, that to pass anything he would have to offer a pretty good composition. Mr. Raphael said that under the circumstances, as the creditors in question had the controlling vote, he could see no advantage in making the proposed, i.e. a scheme of arrangement, under which the debtor would assist in the realization of his estate, and probably pay 20s. in the pound. Under the circumstances he had no other proposition to make, but let the matter go into bankruptcy, and he would deal with the trustee afterwards, in order to obtain the annulment of the adjudication. In reply to the creditors, Mr. Raphael said he was aware that the debtor was liable to lose his interest in a certain Irish contract if bankruptcy ensued, but he feared that the calling of the creditors together had already voided the contract, as to which, however, it was hoped arrangements would be made to enable the debtor to carry it through for the benefit of the estate. The contract, he said, was for £90,000, and Mr. Drinkwater had hoped to make a considerable profit on it. A creditor said he believed the gentlemen with whom the contract was made would not deprive the debtor of his interest if they were satisfied he could carry it through. In the end a resolution was carried for bankruptcy, with Mr. Pixley, of Moorgate Street, Official Receiver to act as a trustee, the Official Receiver to act as a committee of inspection.\nThe public examination of Mr. Drinkwater was held on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. In reply to the Official Solicitor, he said he commenced business in 1865. He failed in 1876, with liabilities to the amount of £28,000, and he assigned everything to his trustee, getting his discharge. Out of his earnings after that he paid £15,000 to creditors under those proceedings. Since then he had undertaken contracts for reclamation of land in Ireland, and, owing to bad weather, he lost considerably on them, possibly £9,000. He took a contract, also, to complete a railway in the south of France, and Captain Harkness had since prosecuted him at Manchester on a charge arising out of it. Mr. Justice Wills, before whom the case was tried, expressed an opinion that the prosecution was most iniquitous, and he was now bound over to prosecute Captain Harkness for perjury. As one result of the proceedings, he lost the French contract, which he had valued at £5,000. He was perfectly solvent at the time he made a settlement on his wife. The examination was ordered to be concluded.\nJ. LITTLE.—A meeting of creditors was held before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt last week in the case of James Little, of 48, Woodchester Street, Harrow Road, builder. At the first meeting (as recently reported) a composition of 5s. in the pound was accepted, payable by instalments. Mr. S. Tilley appeared for the debtor, and Mr. Aldridge for the Official Receiver. Upon examination, the debtor stated that he began business in 1880 with Mr. Barns, each having £100 capital. The partnership continued until August last, when he took over the business, and they were then solvent if they could have realized the property. The only means they had of paying the trade creditors was by realizing the property favourably. He was not used to book keeping, and therefore omitted to keep proper books of account. The examination was concluded. A second meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Friday, Mr. C. J. Stewart, one of the Assistant Official Receivers, presiding. The Official Receiver reported that the estimated surplus from securities...",
