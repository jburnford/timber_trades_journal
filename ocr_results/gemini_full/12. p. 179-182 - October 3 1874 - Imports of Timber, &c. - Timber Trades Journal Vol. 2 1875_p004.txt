Timber Trade Reports.
LONDON.
October 2nd, 1874.
The best indication to be noticed in the timber trade at present is to be found in the steadiness of the retail business, the contest going on between the shippers in the north of Europe and the large importers in the south and west,—the one class to maintain the high rates they established two years ago, and the other to bring down prices to a lower level; and the season being so far run out, it is not likely that any further depression will occur in the trade generally now. In fact, after the unusually bright and warm summer weather we have lately had it will hardly surprise any one should an early winter set in, and interrupt or stop alto-gether, further importation after the end of the present month.
The feeling in the Baltic ports, which we have been at some pains to come at, is that they will be able to establish next year an absolute advance on the present rates, and recent offers sent out with the expectation that they would be gladly, or at least with only seeming reluctance, accepted by the larger holders of stock, have been firmly refused and a counter demand made for at least five per cent. more, before the busi-ness would be entertained.
Their argument is that they cannot obtain any concession as to terms from the intermediate men who buy in the forests, and who are not poor men who must realize their purchases at the readiest market, but men of capital who will not take the prices which the local merchants now offer them, in order to accommodate themselves to the depressed condition of the European markets generally. Thus a kind of dead-lock is for a time established, one refusing to buy on the terms at which alone the others will sell; and this has a tendency to check production, so that when the buyer is willing to give the price asked, advantage is likely to be taken of the shortness of supply and an increase of price demanded.
Another symptom of firmness may be detected in the fact that while foreign shippers are still ready to enter into any engage-ments for the present season so long as the ports remain open, they decline to commit themselves to any prices for the re-opening of the navigation in spring, even at the rates they are willing to accept now; from which we infer that it is at least an even chance that prices will be maintained—and on their part they express themselves confident of a rise. So that where capital is looking out for investment, the timber trade may be found to offer greater inducements than many others for the next few months. Undoubtedly there is a large supply in this country at present, and for the winter months a diminishing demand may be expected. This will render many holders who wish to realize promptly, disposed perhaps even to make a sacrifice of their expected profits for a quick return; and the capitalist whose money is lying at comparatively small interest may here step in with advantage. A few thousand pounds in Erie shares, Guatemala stock, or Spanish bonds, would be liable to cause us some anxiety, if not a few sleepless nights; but the same amount well invested or advanced at this season on timber and deals at the Commercial Docks would have a more solid foundation. The fortunate possessor might spend his winter among the studios and antiquities of Rome, or on the shores of the Mediterranean, without a care on his mind as to the security of the sum he had so invested, or the uncertainty of its making him an adequate return when the time came round to realize it.
A little more disposition to go into stock has lately been
