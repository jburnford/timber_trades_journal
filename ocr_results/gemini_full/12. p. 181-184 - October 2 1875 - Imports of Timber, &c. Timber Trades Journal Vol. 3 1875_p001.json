September 30th.\nTrade here at the docks is very busy, and the quays are well employed, showing more doing than at any other period of the present year. The fall fleet of sailing ships is commencing to arrive. We hear of the steamship trade that is making the trade so active. A great deal is about closed for the Baltic. Importers have obtained a great advantage of freights to odd ports. Small ships have been led to pay this advance sooner than leave over the goods, from the feeling that is gaining ground that there will be an advance in wood goods during the coming winter. The advance in freights is general, which, coupled with the heavy insurance, will materially enhance the cost of import. From the active state of the trade at the close of this season, it is fair to assume that next season will open firmer and more settled at the opening of Sunday night. On Monday, the water of the Humber was so rough that the Gothenburg, Christiania, and other steamships were compelled to remain anchored in the roads, and did not get berthed until about twenty-four hours had elapsed. Heavy gales appear to have set in, and a heavy list of accidents and casualties is the result; and they will doubtless enhance the present rate of insurance.\n\nWEST HARTLEPOOL.\n(From our own Correspondent.) September 30th, 1875.\nWe have a very fair list of arrivals to announce since our last report. Orders, however, are not so plentiful. There is still in great request for middle class goods: best redwood deals are still in good request, and there is a steady demand for freshly imported Riga goods. A large quantity of the past fortnight's imports have been yarded, but the present stocks, although assuming fair proportions with the presentment of the season, are nevertheless comparatively light. A westerly gale blew with much violence during the early hours of the morning of the 27th inst., but without causing any serious damage. Two or three steamers took refuge in the Tees, and a small schooner anchored near the entrance of the harbour, was driven ashore through the breakage of her cable, but has since been got off. The popular saying, \"'Tis an ill wind that blows no one good,\" must have been truly verified this season with regard to auctioneers. On the 20th inst. was sold by public auction at the Albion Saw Mills, by order of the trustees in liquidation, a quantity of mouldings, &c., re Mellanby and Cowley. The sale of the mill and machinery, which at present is being held by a secured creditor to the estate, will take place shortly, and there are already rumours in circulation of several local people who are quite eager to be in possession of the place.\n\nLEITH.\n(From our own Correspondent.) September 30th, 1875.\nSince my last communication we have had a good many arrivals—say 21 cargoes deals and battens, 7 square timber, 4 sleepers, 8 props, 2 lathwood, and 8 various wood goods.\nOur sales by auction are not so numerous as formerly. Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. yesterday sold Archangel deals and battens, Cronstadt, Wyborg, and Dram deals and battens. Prices obtained were considered rather better. The sale was well represented, a large number of buyers being present, and a great quantity of goods disposed of. For next fortnight there is only one sale announced, viz., 5th October, Wm. Thomson and Co., at Victoria Dock, Sundswall, deals and battens, ex Janus and Juliane.\n\nGLASGOW.\n(From our own Correspondent.) September 30th, 1875.\nThe imports of Norway and Baltic woods (chiefly deals and battens) into Grangemouth during the past fortnight have been very large, of which a considerable portion will be forwarded to Port Dundas by canal for consumption at the numerous saw-mills which are now erected there, and also to Edinburgh and the east coast. The railway from Grangemouth is also very well employed in carrying wood to stations situated on all sides of this city. A few days ago an important station at Stobcross (near Yorkhill Wharf) was opened, with the prospect of doing a large business.\nAs will be observed, the arrivals into Greenock and Glasgow have been small; old stocks are therefore getting reduced, and importers and brokers are naturally looking forward to hardening prices, especially as all tradesmen connected with house-building are pretty well employed.\nThe public sale by auction here on the 22nd inst. was fairly attended, and a considerable quantity of Miramichi and Windsor N.S. spruce deals were sold from £6 17s. 6d. to £8 8s. 6d. per std.\nTo-day at Stobcross Yards Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchell sold about 100,000 feet of Tabasco mahogany at from 4d. to 3s. 5d. per foot—ave-\n\n181\nrage nearly 6 3/4d. per foot; about a fifth of the cargo unsold.\nThe import of deals and battens into Clyde from 1st January to 31st August, 1874, was 480,000 pieces from Quebec, 310,000 pieces from St. John, N.B., and 312,000 pieces from other ports, and this year (1875) there has been imported 150,000 pieces from Quebec, 87,000 pieces from St. John, N.B., and 360,000 pieces from other ports. The arrivals into Clyde from British North America this month have been 13,000 tons, against 54,000 tons for the corresponding month of last year.\n\nTHE TYNE.\n(From our own Correspondent.) September 30th, 1875.\nThe prevailing feature of the trade at present here is more so than at any previous time during the present season. Consequence of stocks from Sweden have been only limited, and in consequence of stocks being small the demand appears enough to send all away for early consumption. Merchants are not increasing stock to any apparent extent; and as the Norwegian shippers state that they will send no more to the Tyne this season, except at very much higher rates, we may expect prices will soon show an upward tendency. The demand for floorings in the district continues extremely good, and there being very small importations of foreign manufacture coming forward, all the mills are very busily employed dressing. The shipping season will very probably be at an end, we are able to predict with some certainty that prices will be high, and wood goods—more especially of better classes—very scarce during the season. The building trade shows no signs of declension; on all sides rows of streets are rising; nearly three hundred acres of ground have been sold for building sites during the last three months in close proximity to Newcastle.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From Sept. 16th to Sept. 30th, 1875.\nTIMBER, DEALS, &c.—Delphin @ Miramichi,—499,750 palings, Order.
