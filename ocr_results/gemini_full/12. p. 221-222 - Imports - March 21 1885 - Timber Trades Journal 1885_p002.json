No visitor is ever likely to forget his impressions of the magnificent Corliss Engines which give motion to 10,600 feet of shafting, or of the marvellous ease with which the enormous power they develop is transmitted by the IMMENSE BELTS. As the huge fair is, above everything, an Exposition of Cotton Manufactures in the greatest cotton-growing district of the world, it is in keeping with “the eternal fitness of things” that these ENORMOUS BELTS should also be of cotton. For one of the large engines are supplied with them, the largest belt being SIXTY INCHES WIDE.—See New Orleans “Times-Democrat” of 17th December.] It is an interesting fact that the Americans were the first to adopt the transmission of power from the engine by the means of belts, as also the first to use Cotton Belts, which are now by universal testimony conceded to be superior to every other kind. THESE FOUR LARGE COTTON BELTS were made specially for this great Exposition by\nTHE GANDY BELTING COMPANY,\nBALTIMORE, LONDON, LIVERPOOL, PARIS, HAMBURG, AND VIENNA\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nLEITH.\nMar. 11 Triton-Drontheim-10,707 battens-Mitchell, Somerville, & Co.\n12 Scaramanga - Drontheim-13,320 battens-J.

Imbued with the popular idea that the colony is a desolate flat wilderness, and the inhabitants negroes sufficiently Americanized to vitiate their native qualities, I was somewhat astonished when the gentlemanly bronzed individual in charge informed me that Belize is a town of eight or nine thousand inhabitants, peopled and governed chiefly by the Scotch. A living witness, a countryman of Alexander Mackenzie’s, came up to the exhibitor for orders just then, and corroborated his statement. The only portion of Central America over which British colours wave, it is the only spot among all the petty states that is not continually and blood-thirstily exercised over the maintenance of its dignity. Two hundred years ago a few British pioneers came to Honduras to cut logwood and mahogany. Their arrival was regarded by Spain as an impertinent intrusion, and it was only by successive treaties with that power Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States that the colony remains British to-day. Now the exhibit The woods first, of course, the wealth of the colony. A mahogany log 23 ft. long, 4 ft. square, and a cedar 20 ft. long and 4 ft. square, are the biggest things in the space.\n\nMARCH 21, 1885.\nCedar is used chiefly for cigar boxes; but of the mahogany we have more to see. Two ‘spurs’ sliced cleanly out of the root of the tree stand ready for table-tops. One is almost round, 5 ft. in diameter. The other is a beautiful horn-shaped piece, about 5 ft. 4 in. by 5 ft. 6 in. A signed inlaid hat-rack, and three signed inlaid card-tables, all from Government House, where they have sojourned for eighty years, are also shown. ‘What is the value of one of these spurs?’ I asked my pleasant informant. ‘About three or four dollars.’ ‘And that at twenty-five. But the market is flooded. I cannot sell just now. People have had a craze for black walnut too. Now it is getting scarce, and they have to look to us again for woods. Mahogany will soon supersede. It is infinitely more durable than any other. Now this piece,’ he added, taking up a beautifully polished piece of wood, ‘was taken from a log that formed part of the foundation of the old Belize court-house, and which had lay underground for over sixty years; as you see, it is as sound as a bell.’ Indian bowls cut out of the solid wood and curiously ornamented, with various other utensils, are heaped up in a basket woven of the cocoanut fibre. Here is a narrow boat, from 40 to 50 ft. long, but only 3 ft. wide. It is scooped out of a mahogany log and is paddled up the tributaries to the cutters with provisions. Indeed, it is the only means of river transportation. Several models are shown, one under which the ‘boss’ reports on his visits of investigation. This one bears the inscription on one side, ‘No bolder man.’ Another, a perfect poem of a boat, has the legend ‘Sub umbra floret’ engraved on the back of the seat. Rosewood and ziricote, a wood resembling ivory, come next in value. The toomu tree, with its fruit shown, and logwood, indiarubber product, is also shown, and logwood and fustic, which as every schoolboy knows are exported for dyes. The woods of Central America are simply unknown in beauty and value. Here they stand, oiled and beautiful, fifty varieties. Copal, palmaletto, madre de cacao, creva, ban tan, and pimpla, of the cabbage tree, which the natives use for clapboards. No nail can pierce its density. The fruit of the tree, when young and tender, makes an excellent substitute for cabbage.\n\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nW. C. ELLIS.—The receiving order in this case was made on December 6th, the debtor being described as of Ivy Cottage Works, Uxbridge Road, builder, and the Official Receiver applied to the Court last week for the approval of resolutions come to by the creditors at the first meeting. The liabilities were stated in the accounts at £517 10s., and the assets at £690 10s., but they consisted of an estimated surplus from mortgaged property, and were not expected to be realized. A composition of 1s. in the pound was accepted, payable within one month from the date of approval, and the Official Receiver reported that the resolutions, having regard to the nature of the assets, were reasonable, and calculated to benefit the creditors. Mr. Registrar Brougham made an order approving of the resolutions.\nARTHUR SMITH.—An adjourned meeting for public examination was held before Mr. Registrar Pepys on Tuesday, under the bankruptcy of Arthur Smith, of Albany Road, Camberwell, Commercial Works, Rotherhithe, and East Twickenham, builder and contractor. The statement of affairs disclosed total liabilities expected to rank £22,714; and debts fully secured, £150,948; assets, £62,047; there being thus an estimated surplus of £39,332, subject to realization. Mr. W. F. Baker appeared for the trustee, Mr. Tanner for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Tilling on behalf of a creditor. Upon examination by Mr. Tanner, the bankrupt stated that he went into partnership with his brother about ten years since, and it was dissolved in May, 1881. They divided the property, but he had an additional £1,000, as his brother had overdrawn to that extent. He did not now consider that he was insolvent, because he had an estimated surplus of £39,000. He kept books, but not a ledger, and he had two clerks who attended to the book-keeping. A large amount of the mortgages had been given during the last three months. He thought he was very rich if he could realize the property, but he could neither let the houses nor sell them. He held a private meeting of creditors at the end of last year, and presented a statement of affairs before them, his position being very much the same then as now. He allowed Mr. Woodcock, a creditor, to remove 50,000 bricks from his premises early in December. He did so because Mr. Woodcock was a poor man and unable to afford to lose the bricks. He did not know that he was insolvent then any more than he did now if he could have realized the property. He had never failed before. By Mr. Baker: He started with £6,000, after dissolving partnership with his brother. His business consisted in taking building estates and developing them, raising money upon mortgage as he went along. He attributed his building operations up to the time of his suspension, and to obtain advances up to the same date. With one exception, all the mortgages which he gave were for moneys actually advanced at the time. He had given full information with regard to the further mortgage which he executed by way of further security. He on suspended payment on December 24th. On December 8th a large portion of his properties had been valued by Mr. Whittaker Ellis and Mr. Fowler, and the valuation was £175,000, of which was more than the total amount of his debts. He had given the trustee information as to the removal of the bricks by Mr. Woodcock, and was still willing to give all the assistance in his power. He had had no communication with the trustees as to the amounts received from the mortgagees. Mr. Tilling said the bankrupt had given the trustee all the information, and he had no doubt he would still continue to do so. The trustee had no knowledge of the formal compliance, but it was consented to with the examination being concluded. By Mr. Tilling: He first had a debt in the ordinary course. At the end of December an execution was put in his furniture for £395, but his brother-in-law paid it back from the Sheriff, and then it was sold to his (bankrupt's) wife. There was no valuation. He was making the statement from the facts before him. His Honour thereupon ordered the examination to be concluded.
