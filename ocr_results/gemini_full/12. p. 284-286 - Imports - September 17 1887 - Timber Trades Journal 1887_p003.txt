PRACTICAL NOTES
[Our Readers are invited to avail themselves of this column both to ask questions connected with saw-mill and building materials, and also to impart information by replying to the questions asked. Questions are given one week and the answers to them in the following issue.]
QUESTIONS.
Cross-cut Saw Bench for Box Work.
—What form of saw bench do you recommend as the most expeditious and best suited for the above work, and the approximate price?—S. & Co.
Cutting Thin Boards.—I have a small deal frame, and get on all right, except in cutting thin boards, say 5 cuts in 3 in. when between the saws get blocked, the sawdust collecting and jamming, also the bottoms of the deals are torn and bruised. The blocks between the saws are made triangular. Can you suggest a remedy?—Novice.
ANSWERS.
Mortise Chisels.—We notice in your issue of last week a statement by Messrs. John Wood & Co. to the effect that any chisel made with a portion of its groove parallel, so as to effectually bite the chips when it is cut, is the principle on which these chisels are made, and is the essential element, however otherwise differently constructed, would be an infringement of Wood's patent rights, and would render the parties dealing with it liable. We beg to inform your readers that we have both manufactured and had in actual work in our joiners' shops for more than twenty years chisels grooved in the manner described above, and that we have still in our employment a mechanic who made such chisels for us twenty years since, and a joiner who worked a foot mortising machine with such chisels twenty years ago; therefore, it is no infringement of any patent right for either ourselves or any one else to make or use them.—THOMAS ROBINSON & SON, Limited, Railway Works, Rochdale, 13th September, 1887.
Weight of Firewood.—On the basis that 50 cubic feet of firewood equal one ton, a fathom of firewood would weigh 4 tons 6 1/2 cwt. The rates for railway carriage differ with different companies. We can recommend you the following works on woodworking machinery, which we can supply post free at the prices given : Woodworking Machinery, by M. Powis Bale, 13s. ; Saw-mills, their Arrangement and Management, same author, 11s.
BUILDING NEWS.
A new church is to be built at Carmarthen.
The Crown post office at Shrewsbury is to be enlarged.
A temperance hall is to be built at Barnstaple.
Detached villas are to be erected at St. Helen's Bay, Belfast.
Extensive alterations are to be made to the town hall at Northampton.
A lady named Thompson, of Sandgate, has bequeathed £10,000 for the erection of a new church, at Cheriton near Folkestone. Lord Radnor has also undertaken to complete the erection of Trinity Church at a cost of about £5,000.
The Wolverhampton Board of Guardians have confirmed their decision to erect new workhouse schools at a cost of £12,000. The ratepayers objected to the expenditure as being unnecessary, but a resolution rescinding the decision of the Board, which was brought before the last meeting of the Board, was rejected.
On Tuesday evening, at about eight o'clock, a serious accident occurred in Shoreditch. During the past few days workmen have been employed in pulling down an old house in Austin Street, round which there was a wall.
