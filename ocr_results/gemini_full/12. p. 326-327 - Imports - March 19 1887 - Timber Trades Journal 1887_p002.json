Britain, Limited, 11, Queen Victoria Street, London, E.C., have issued a catalogue of their electrical appliances, a copy of which they have kindly forwarded to us. We have gone through it with a great deal of interest, and find it to contain quite a store of information upon the subject of electricity and the various appliances now employed in subjection. The potential force to be employed in subjection has yet been found capable, and which in the future we have no doubt will be largely extended. In this country will be large milltates very strongly vested interests in opposition to which the electric light is making its way; notably in saw-mills. We are pleased to see this, for the benefits of the light to saw-millers are manifold. In Sweden the illumination, whilst it is also extensively employed in the United States, and indeed in all our colonies. Those who may be contemplating the use of the electric light could do no better than place themselves into communication with the company we have mentioned. The catalogue referred to contains a variety of articles for this purpose, besides all kinds, and it can be had from the company post free for a shilling.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nACTON, JOHN.—The report of the Official Receiver in the case of this debtor, who carried on business as a builder and contractor at Knutsford, showed that the total indebtedness was £2,463; the assets had realised a little more than £200, or sufficient for a dividend of 10¾d. in the pound. It also stated that the bankrupt had omitted to keep books of account which disclosed his financial position within three years preceding his bankruptcy, and that he had contracted the whole of the debts provable in the bankruptcy without having any reasonable expectation of being able to pay them. Acton some time ago built several lots of property in Knutsford. Owing to depreciation, he had lost a great deal of money on that property; he also lost about £1,000 in an action which he brought against Mr. Carver, for whom he built a house. The debtor applied at the Manchester Court on Saturday last for his discharge, which His Honour granted subject to suspension for twelve months.\n\nASTRUP, THOMAS, timber merchant, 58, Lombard Street, E.C.—This case has been previously reported, and the meeting for the bankrupt’s public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The accounts showed unsecured liabilities to the amount of £3,823 17s. 2d., and debts fully secured £6,154 7s. 7d.; with assets estimated at £404 0s. 1d. In reply to the Official Solicitor, the bankrupt stated that he commenced business in 1875 in partnership with Mr. T. Harland, with a joint capital of £400. They traded together until April, 1880, when the partnership was dissolved, and he took over the assets and liabilities. The assets were then estimated at about £400 over the liabilities, and at the end of 1880 (the year being a prosperous one) his estate, including his private property, showed a surplus of £2,500. They had no stock, it being an agency business, and they received goods free-on-board, and sold them on commission. He attributes his failure mainly to a liability for £1,400 under a judgment recovered against him in respect of certain bills which he had drawn, and for which he received no consideration. The bills were accepted by an Australian firm, and judgment was given against him for £1,400 and costs. No opposition was offered, and the bankrupt passed his examination.\n\nBARTON, A. J., builder, Carlyle Terrace, Rosendale Road, East Dulwich.—The first meeting in this case (reported last week) was held on Tuesday before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The unsecured liabilities were stated in the accounts at £1,811 4s. 1d., and debts fully secured, £18,695 3s. 11d.; against stock, &c., £15; and a nominal surplus of £2,910 from property held as security. An adjudication had already been made, and the estate will accordingly be wound up in bankruptcy.\n\nBISHOP, J. G., builder, 15, Kelvin Terrace, Highbury.—The first meeting under this failure was held on Tuesday before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The accounts showed unsecured liabilities £10,663 8s. 11d., and debts fully secured £24,467; assets, £80.

G., Goswell Road ... ... ... 112 10 0\n\nIn 1879 the debtor, who was then a licensed victualler and omnibus contractor and builder, presented a petition for liquidation, his unsecured liabilities amounting to £5,225, and he has since been chiefly engaged in completing properties for the mortgagees. Mr. R. Chapman appeared for the debtor, who had been adjudged bankrupt, and he has since been chiefly engaged in completing properties for the mortgagees. Mr. R. Chapman appeared for the debtor, who had been adjudged bankrupt, and made. ‘In the absence of a quorum of creditors no resolution was passed, and the chairman (Mr. Wreford) said that, so far as he could see at present, the furniture, which had realised £93, was the only asset, unless something could be got from the equities of redemption.\n\nCAMPBELL, JOHN, builder, of Reigate and Redhill.—In this matter an application for discharge, has just been made to the Court. The report of the Official Receiver (Mr. Cecil Mercer of Westminster) was submitted to his Honour Judge Vernon Lushington, Q.C., to whom the application was made. It showed that the debtor had only a small capital when he began, and this was borrowed money. This was after his failure in 1882, and in the “ordinary way,” and the properties were duly mortgaged and sold. He (the Official Receiver) opposed the application “in the interests of commercial morality.” The assets had only realised £18. He (the debtor) seemed to have brought himself into his present position by “rash and hazardous” speculations. His Honour refused the application for discharge.",
