October 10th, 1877.
There have been numerous arrivals here during the last few days, consisting chiefly of deals from Quebec and Miramichi. These imports, with stock in the Yorkhill yards here are now equal to present demands or consumption; indeed were it not that a considerable proportion of tonnage is required for other purposes (causing a rise in freights), we should say the market here is assuming the appearance of being overstocked. The aggregate import of Quebec deals from 1st January to the end of September amounts to 680,000 pieces, as compared with 462,000 for last year.

There have been three auction sales at Yorkhill yards during the fortnight, viz., sales of deals and boards on Thursday, 27th ult., at which there was a large attendance, Edmiston and Mitchells, brokers; also Allison, Cousland, and Hamilton's sale on the 4th inst.; and on the 9th Messrs. Edmiston and Mitchells offered a large cargo of Tabasco mahogany, the import of S. Lett, Esq.

There was a fair attendance at this sale, and about 700,000 feet, including most of the large sized wood, was sold, average price about 7½d.

October 12th, 1877.
The arrivals of wood goods continue to increase. My returns for last fortnight show 73 vessels, being upwards of 30 more than the previous fortnight. I find these to consist of 30 cargoes deals and battens, 5 cargoes Baltic timber, 3 cargoes Quebec timber, 7 cargoes sleepers, 25 cargoes pit props, besides various lots lathwood.

Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. exposed for sale on the 2nd inst. deals and battens. There was a large attendance, and several lots were disposed of. The sale throughout was dull. The following prices were obtained, viz. :—
Crown red Wyborg 8 x 3 2 1/8d.
Second „ „ 6½ x 2½ 1 1/8d.
„ „ „Kemi” 11 x 3 3d. to 3 3/8d.

The Swedish deals, “Kemi,” first-rate quality and in fine order.

Messrs. Risk and Co. held their third quarterly sale at the Edinburgh and Leith Saw-mills on the 9th inst., Mr. Stewart, one of the partners, being auctioneer. The attendance at the commencement was not so large as might have been expected, but as the sale progressed the company increased, and latterly some good buyers came forward. The prices did not come up to the exposers' expectations, still several parcels changed hands. Seventy-five lots waney (Michigan) were offered, and all varying from 2 5/8d. to 3½d. These were sold except 10 lots, the prices not sold, as is customary, at 8d. average.

Ten lots yellow pine boards, cut from first quality Michigan deals, brought from 2 11/16d. to 3 5/8d. First quality yellow pine deals fetched 2s. 9½d. to 3s. 1½d. per cubic foot. Several parcels were withdrawn for want of competition.

[OCTOBER 13, 1877.
first quality yellow pine deals, 2s. 3d. to 2s. 4d. per cubic foot. Most of these lots were disposed of, and they appeared to be in demand. A parcel of waney pine logs were offered, and found buyers at 2s. 1d. to 2s. 5½d. per cubic foot.

Flooring is a class of goods appeared to be wanted, and sarking 8d., all per yard. This class of goods were disposed of, but the prices need not be enumerated. Various other lots were disposed of.

The number of buyers was very small, and business very stiff.

Trade here just now is pretty active. Importers are busy landing and storing cargoes, which seem to be turning out satisfactorily. Stocks will be lighter this season, and in view of the expected revival of the jute and flax trades a better paying trade is looked for next spring.
