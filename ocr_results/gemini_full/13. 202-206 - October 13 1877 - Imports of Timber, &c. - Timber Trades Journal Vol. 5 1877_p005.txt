American Intelligence.
NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," September 29th.)
Dependent upon local influences solely, our general lumber market would scarcely find base for a gain of tone, but through outside sources comes the stimulus, which at least retains the steady feeling before noted.
On the leading primary markets, especially at the west, the fall trade sprang up suddenly, and has since continued good; values naturally hardened and are well sustained, with sellers hinting at a further advance; the cost and difficulties of transportation have increased, with little chance of reaction at this season of the year, and coastwise supplies are reduced; from one source through apparent scarcity, and from another through difficulties encountered in obtaining freight accommodation.
The foreign trade continues to receive much attention, and responds fairly, with the return on shipments remunerative and advices encouraging.
The South American markets are growing stronger, and it is thought will send some large orders before the expiration of the year.
The deal shipments through this port appear to have ceased, no clearances being reported by the Custom House for some time, nor do we learn of vessels chartered for carrying this class of goods.
As the western papers are silent on the subject, and foreign accounts unpropitious, it is probable that the filling of old contracts has brought the experiment to an end for the time being at least.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," September 29th.)
The week just closed has been fairly active at the wholesale docks.
A considerable fleet has been offered, and, with the exception of a few cargoes that are unsold this morning, has all been disposed of.
Buyers have been sufficiently plenty to enable the supply to be disposed of about as fast as received; but hardly enough competition has been developed to cause any increase of firmness on the part of holders.
Quotations at this writing are unchanged, and as far as can be discovered are likely to remain so, for a while at least.
The offerings still continue to be mainly of rather poor lumber, which tends to prevent many sales that might otherwise be made.
