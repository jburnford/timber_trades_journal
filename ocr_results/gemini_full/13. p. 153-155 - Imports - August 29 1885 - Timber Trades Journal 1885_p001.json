But enthusi-\nadvocates of Irish afforestation should rem-\nber to prove the diverse commercial condi-\nof success involved in more than one of\npropositions. For instance, even though\ngeology of Erin is singular in having a mag-\ncent carboniferous system, practically de-\nof coal-beds, could its future supplies of v\nfuel compete with the mineral supplies of\nEnglish coal-fields?

This would have the effect\nprotecting the banks from the injuriou-\neffects of wind waves, and would shelter th-\nland behind. Such efforts have been most\nuseful in several parts of Limerick.
