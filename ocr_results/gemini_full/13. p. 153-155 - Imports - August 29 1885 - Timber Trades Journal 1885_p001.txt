All speed to such needed reforms as are
indicated in railway charges. But enthusi-
advocates of Irish afforestation should rem-
ber to prove the diverse commercial condi-
of success involved in more than one of
propositions. For instance, even though
geology of Erin is singular in having a mag-
cent carboniferous system, practically de-
of coal-beds, could its future supplies of v
fuel compete with the mineral supplies of
English coal-fields? Further, are the tur-
tine, resin, or wood-charcoal markets
capable of absorbing unlimited supplies

Foresters alone cannot afford to ignore sup-

The French Forest Department have
charge of the restoration and conservation
mountain pasture lands. So the Irish fore-
problem may legitimately embrace the furt-
improvement of the country specially
stock-raising; merely keeping tree-planting
a means to such an end. Now Mr. G.
Kinahan, of the Geological Survey of Irela-
has given evidence bearing on this before

Thus 4,000 acres might be reclaimed from th-

strongly recommended the planting of willo-

protecting the banks from the injuriou-
effects of wind waves, and would shelter th-
land behind. Such efforts have been most
useful in several parts of Limerick. When h-

which were now barren, and which might be
utilised by planting in the same way as plant-
ing had been carried out in some parts o-
France. If they planted these sands wit-
trees, the flow would be stopped, and much o-
the land behind could be brought under tillage-
He knew that in some instances the planting
of fir trees under these circumstances had
failed to produce timber, but shelter had been
given to the land, which in itself was of
much benefit. In France, where there had
been a failure to produce timber, the trees had
yielded large quantities of turpentine and
pitch, and he saw no reason why trees should
not grow as well in Ireland, notwithstanding
climatal differences.
