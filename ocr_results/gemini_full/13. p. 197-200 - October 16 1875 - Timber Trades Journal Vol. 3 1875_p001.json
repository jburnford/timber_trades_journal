  "text": "[OCTOBER 16, 1875.]\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nalready announced are about 100 less than in the corresponding period of last year Freights are advancing, and tonnage is scarce.\nThe stock of deals is considered not to fall far short of 5,000,000, of which not more than 25 per cent, is of first and second qualities.\nIt is anticipated that a large quantity of these goods will be shipped to London this autumn.\nThere is a much smaller proportion of timber held back this year than in preceding ones; of oak, it is stated that every stick cut in Michigan has been cleared out of the woods and sent down.\nIt is only on the Ottawa that timber in any quantity is held back.\nThat the production during the ensuing winter will fall far short of previous years is admitted on all hands.\nSo many rafts have been sold here recently under the actual cost, that if the lumbermen had any inclination, they have not the means of carrying on their operations.\nThe banks are almost unanimous in their determination to withhold further advances till prices will admit of a margin of profit.\nThere is also every reason to suppose that the members of the Lumbermen's Association will faithfully abide by the resolution limiting production, which they adopted at their late meeting.\nIt is certain that there will be a considerable falling off in the number of manufacturers during the coming season; and it is equally certain that the banks have set their faces against assisting any new operators.\nUnder these circumstances there is at least, a possibility that in future the timber supply of the country will be regulated by a safer guide than caprice or inconsiderate speculation.\n\nCOMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF TIMBER, &c., measured by order of Supervisor of Cullers to the 1st October, for the years 1873, 1874, and 1875.\n1873. 1874. 1875.\nWaney White Pine.... 2,646,679 1,287,383 1,373,625\nWhite Pine ............ 9,225,504 6,642,816 9,106,752\nRed Pine ............... 2,869,454 4,095,778 1,619,442\nOak ...................... 1,103,276 2,010,994 2,417,583\nElm ...................... 205,927 892,000 586,477\nAsh....................... 22,606 52,518 254,974\nBasswood ............... 1,866 4,195 16,333\nButternut .............. 58,751 263,099 1,081\nTamarac................. 836,361 858,914 182,697\nBirch and Maple ...... 50 58 132,176\nMasts and Bowsprits...pcs. 45 10 70\nSpars.......................pcs. 1644.0.0.1 1694.7.3.21 765.2.2.21\nStandard Staves ...... ... 5604.4.3.5 1223.0.3.24 773.3.0.2\nW.
