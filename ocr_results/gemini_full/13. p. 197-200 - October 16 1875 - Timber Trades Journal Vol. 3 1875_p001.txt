THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
already announced are about 100 less than in the corresponding period of last year Freights are advancing, and tonnage is scarce.
The stock of deals is considered not to fall far short of 5,000,000, of which not more than 25 per cent, is of first and second qualities.
It is anticipated that a large quantity of these goods will be shipped to London this autumn.
There is a much smaller proportion of timber held back this year than in preceding ones; of oak, it is stated that every stick cut in Michigan has been cleared out of the woods and sent down.
It is only on the Ottawa that timber in any quantity is held back.
That the production during the ensuing winter will fall far short of previous years is admitted on all hands.
So many rafts have been sold here recently under the actual cost, that if the lumbermen had any inclination, they have not the means of carrying on their operations.
The banks are almost unanimous in their determination to withhold further advances till prices will admit of a margin of profit.
There is also every reason to suppose that the members of the Lumbermen's Association will faithfully abide by the resolution limiting production, which they adopted at their late meeting.
It is certain that there will be a considerable falling off in the number of manufacturers during the coming season; and it is equally certain that the banks have set their faces against assisting any new operators.
Under these circumstances there is at least, a possibility that in future the timber supply of the country will be regulated by a safer guide than caprice or inconsiderate speculation.

NEW YORK.
(From the Real Estate Record, Sept. 18th.)
Our general wholesale market is still quite dull, and tame, with scarcely sufficient variation to warrant a report for the current week.
Buyers from all quarters came forward very slowly and indifferently, and even where orders for future delivery were expected there has been disappointment, and only a few negotiations worth speaking of were successfully accomplished.
The present offering of supplies are not in shape to cause any pressure, and it is understood that every effort possible is being made to keep the addition small, but still there is plenty and to spare for all current outlets, with possibly an exception in the way of good selection of coarse lumber.
The export demand, too, keeps within narrow limits, and recent advices from several dependent foreign markets do not seem to indicate any revival of this trade for the present.
Bad as the market is, however, we do not think it quite so utterly hopeless and forsaken as one of our city journals, calling itself a leading commercial paper, would make it appear, and instead, a great many dealers, as noted in our last, are still quite hopeful that a fair amount of stock will yet be wanted this Fall, especially the choice and standard descriptions, upon which shrinkage in value has been sufficient to cause an acknowledgment of cheapness by buyers.
Most of the advices from the interior now coming to hand are firm in their tenor, and making full allowance for natural high colouring, there is no doubt that business at least is improving, and considerable stock being started for tide water.
In some cases freights have strengthened a trifle, but we learn of no addition to cost of lumber as yet.

BAY CITY, MICHIGAN.
(From the Lumberman's Gazette, Sept. 24th )
The last week has been barren of events which materially affect the lumber market at this point The terrible storm of last week has had the effect to discourage the shipping business to some extent, and there has been a dearth of buyers as well.
From careful inquiry we are of the opinion that less lumber changed hands during the week than during any previous week this season.
Possibly the question of who it is safe to sell to may have had some influence on the minds of our lumbermen Experience is a dear teacher, and after having tried both ways, nearly all of the Saginaw River manufacturers have come to the conclusion

that it is better to hold their lumber than to sell to irresponsible or shaky firms abroad.
Lack of confidence is not confined to the East, the symptoms of the disease are visible here as well.
We make no change in quotations.

ALBANY.
(From the Albany Argus, Sept. 21st.)
There has been a fair business during the week in lumber.
To-day the district wears a quiet appearance.
The receipts, which are light, are ample for the demand.
Stocks are sufficient and well assorted.
Coarse lumber is in light receipt, in decreasing stock, and firmly held.
Prices of both spruce and hemlock have an upward tendency.
Holders of hemlock boards say that quotations are kept down by the low price at which common pine is selling; while the holders of common pine say they could get more therefore if the trade asked more money for hemlock boards.
