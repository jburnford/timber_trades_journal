CUTLER.—The first meeting of the creditors of Edward J. Cutler, builder, of Campbell Grove Road, Springbourne, Bournemouth, was held at the London Hotel, Poole, on the 19th inst, when the debtor and about half a dozen creditors attended. Mr. F. A. Dawes, Official Receiver, presided. The liabilities to unsecured creditors were put down at £209, other creditors at £1,920 13s. 11d. hold securities estimated to be worth £2,660. The assets were stated to be as follows:—Stock-in-trade, £15; book debts, £126; household furniture, £3 10s.; and surplus from securities in the hands of creditors, £769 6s. 1d.; total £913 16s. 1d. The bankrupt attributed his failure to inability to realize his estate, including property at Southbourne-on-Sea and elsewhere. He added that he was of opinion that the value of his property exceeded the charges in it, and also the amount due to unsecured creditors. After hearing the debtor's statement it was resolved to adjourn the meeting until the following Wednesday, Mr. Hogg and Mr. H. Locke being appointed as a committee of inquiry to ascertain the value of the securities held for the charges on the debtor's property, and also to make inquiries into other matters.\nJOHN MOON.—This matter has been previously reported. A special meeting of the creditors was held at 39, Bond Street, Brighton, on Friday, when the Official Receiver (Mr. A. Mackintosh) presided. The latter stated that since the last meeting the debtor had been endeavouring to make an arrangement by which the sale of his property at a great sacrifice would be prevented. He was prepared to make an offer of 12s. 6d. in the pound, payable in four instalments extending over a year. He could not, however, guarantee the same, and the question was whether they would appoint a trustee under a scheme of arrangement, providing for the payment of the composition, or put the estate into bankruptcy. As the debtor's son-in-law had obtained judgment under an action, and was in possession of some property, it was necessary to appoint a trustee. A creditor urged that the matter should go into bankruptcy, and the Receiver remarked that he should vote against the composition, as it was not secured. After discussion it was decided to vote for adjournment, with Mr. F. Clark, accountant, Brighton, as trustee.\nF. H. GILDER.—This case has been previously reported, the debtor being described as of Goswell Road, timber merchant, and secretary to the Para Rubber Company. An application was made to the Court last week for the approval of the resolutions come to at the first meeting. The Official Receiver reported that the debtor filed his petition on December 15th, showing his liabilities at £4,692, and assets £468; and the creditors accepted a composition of 4s. 6d. in the pound, payable in cash within twenty-one days from the date of approval, in addition to the costs and preferential claims. The liabilities, except to the extent of about £50, had arisen from the debtor having allowed his father (an undisclosed chant in his name, the debtor having no knowledge whatever of the business. Mr. Registrar Brougham made an order approving of the resolution.\nB. T. WOOD.—The debtor, Benjamin Thomas Wood, of 4, Linscott Road, Clapton, and formerly of 18, Morning Lane, Hackney, builder, filed his petition on February 26th, and the first meeting of creditors was held last week before Mr. Stewart, Assistant Receiver. A statement of affairs was furnished showing unsecured debts £1,881 17s. 3d., debts fully secured £10,993 9s. 8d., (value of security £100); other liabilities on bills discounted £157 10s. 8d.; and liabilities which £67 16s. 9d. of which was expected to rank. Total amount expected to rank, £2,157 4s. 8d. Assets: good debts £129 2s. 7d., doubtful and bad £315 8s. 10d. (value nil), estimated surplus",
