FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ALLEN, WILLIAM, carpenter, Totnes.-The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held at the office of the Official Receiver (Mr. J. Greenway), Frankfort Street, Plymouth, on Tuesday. Mr. F. W. Skardon appeared for the debtor, whose statement of affairs showed liabilities to unsecured creditors, £266 16s. 1d.; and assets, £82 1s. 10d.; less £14 17s. due to preferential creditors; leaving a deficiency of £199 11s. 3d. The debtor attributed his failure to sickness of himself and family, his hay on premises, and want of capital. He had been in business four years, and began with a capital of £20. No offer of composition was made, and it was determined to wind up the estate in bankruptcy. The creditors are:-

BISHOP, J. G., builder, 15, Kelvin Terrace, Highbury, N.-This case was reported last week, and the meeting for the bankrupt's public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The accounts showed unsecured liabilities, £10,663 8s. 11d.; and debts fully secured, £24,467; assets, £80. Mr. F. C. Willis appeared for the bankrupt, and Mr. Tanner for the Official Receiver. The bankrupt passed his examination.
BRAY, W. H., builder, &c., Truro.-This debtor appeared for public examination at the Truro Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday, before his Honour Judge Bere. The Official Receiver (Mr. G. Appleby Jenkins) said this was as important a case as he thought they had had in that court for a long time, and he had felt so important that, under the 338th rule of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, he had called upon the debtor to furnish an account of receipts and payments. He then proceeded to examine the debtor, who, in reply to questions, said he commenced business in March, 1869, with a capital of £10. He first became aware of his insolvency in 1881, when he lost £300 on the contract for St. George's Chapel. He should think that he was about £400 to the bad at that time, the other £100 loss being on two houses which he built for a man who absconded. If everything he then had had been realised, he dare say he should have been £300 to the bad. He did not think he had been solvent from that time up to the time of the receiving order. He kept on working hard, trying, by perseverance and energy, to get over his difficulties. With regard to certain sums-receipts and payments-he promised to give particulars of them in the statement of account he was preparing for the Official Receiver. Debtor admitted that in the early part of February he completed a contract to build a stable or store for Mr. Avery, ironmonger, Truro, for £61, the materials having been obtained on credit. He received £10 from Mr. Avery, and the balance went in settlement of an account he had with Mr. Avery. Asked as to whether this constituted a fraudulent preference under the Act, his Honour said the last decision on the subject was an awkward one, as it upset the whole of the previous doctrine on the point. The Official Receiver said the matter was one that must be inquired into. The examination was then adjourned to the next court, to be taken before his Honour.

CANTRELL, GEORGE H., coachbuilder and wheelwright, Burton-on-Trent.-The public examination of this debtor took place at the Burton-on-Trent Court House on the 17th inst. A statement of affairs and list of creditors appeared in our last week's issue. Mr. Wilson represented the debtor, and Mr. Hall, the Assistant Official Receiver, conducted the examination. The debtor stated that he commenced business as a coachbuilder and wheelwright in April, 1885, with a capital of £60, which money was given him by his grandfather. About Easter, 1886, he built a house and workshop at Stretton upon leasehold property at a cost of £564. He was solvent at that time. He had not sold any tools since his insolvency. The examination was concluded.
CLINCH & PATTEN, builders and decorators, Rotherfield Street, Islington, N.-A receiving order was recently made in this case upon the debtors' petition, and the accounts which they have filed show liabilities £428 18s. 9d., with assets £74 4s. 6d.; the following being scheduled as creditors:-

COLLIER, RICHARD GEORGE, builder, Worthing.-Last week a meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Brighton. Mr. A. S. Cully presided. The gross liabilities are £146 0s. 2d., of which £134 10s. 2d. are expected to rank, and assets, £115 0s. 11d. The deficiency, £19 9s. 3d.-deficiency. The debtor commenced business at Bognor in 1882, with a capital of £50. He remained there two years, at the end of which time he made a private arrangement, paying 10s. in the pound to his creditors. Starting again in 1883 at Worthing, with a very small capital, he had continually borrowed money at exorbitant rates of interest, and attributed his deficiency to that he partly adjudicated a bankrupt. The creditors are:-
