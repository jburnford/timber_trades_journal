American Intelligence.
NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," October 13th.)
Our market is a steady one, and the amount of business in aggregate fair, but beyond this sellers cannot claim much advantage for the present, nor any encouraging signs for the future, if an increase is calculated upon.
The most economical of all buyers is the consumer, who still sticks closely to the hand-to-mouth policy, and this influence of course is reflected back through the entire market, and prevents demand, except upon a basis of actual necessity.
So far as shown, winter necessities are not likely to be much in excess of last year, and hence the absence of any liberal preparations.
As near as can be judged at present, the accumulation of stocks here will, for building purposes, be composed largely of coarse stuff, while a fair amount must be secured in the way of box boards, light and heavy, and for export about the usual quantity and assortment.
The finer grades of soft woods, however, seem to be considered as without promising indications, and our dealers are not inclined to carry much, while the hardwoods will also be handled sparingly, and especially as a great many styles are always more or less within easy reach.
Advices from coastwise points of supply, especially eastward, are generally quite firm, and interior accounts speak more or less hopefully, but thus far buyers have met with no adverse influences except the advance on freights.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," October 3rd.)
The state of the market continues much as it was at our last report.
If there is any change it is an increasing firmness on the part of sellers.
