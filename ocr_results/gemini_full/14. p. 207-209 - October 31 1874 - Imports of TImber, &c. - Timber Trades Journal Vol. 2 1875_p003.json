We say present requirements advisedly, because it is understood that very few speculators have yet come forward, though we think we discern, in the larger inquiry and (when price is agreed) comparative indifference to quantity which have lately come under our notice, a kind of general impression that prices are not going to be lower, and that therefore that no considerable mistake can be made by laying in sufficient stock now to render the buyer independent of the vicissitudes of the market between this and next spring.\nThough it has been the fashion all through this season to complain of the dulness of business, the returns of the Board of Trade which were placed before our readers in the previous number of this Journal must be taken to prove the very reverse. With a large excess in the quantity of wood imported over that of last year how could prices have been so well sustained had there not been also a great increase of consumption? Take by contrast the case of assuming that the imports of this year had not exceeded those of 1873, is it not more than probable that instead of a depression of prices we should have seen a very marked and increasing advance? Such is the rapid development and extension of trade and industry in this country, that the importation of a hundred thousand loads of timber more or less does not sensibly affect the general market as to prices save in a very remote and transient degree.\nThe Baltic fleet of late summer ships has been delayed and has not yet arrived. Many in unusualy this season, attempting to make their passage against contrary winds and bad weather have been driven back, and some with damage, resuming their voyage for some time; but now that the wind seems settling in the eastern quarter we may expect a considerable addition to the supply already at market, but these must be counted the last of the season, because it will be too late for any of the ships to return to the north of Europe this fall, and doubtless many expected cargoes will be missing. In fact, we are of opinion that the effects of the heavy gales of last week are not yet fully appreciated. Our last advices from Norway inform us that there has been a great destruction of shipping on that coast, and that \"the Christiania Fiord is strewed with wreck from the hurricane.\"\nThere is no concession of prices from abroad since our last impression—the tendency is generally the other way; but if a ship were on the spot and ready to load before the ports close, her cargo might no doubt be purchased under the current quotations. The prospect of getting early payment for the goods, instead of having to keep them through the winter unprofitably, would be worth an abatement to every vender; but we do not hear that there is any eagerness to part with such stocks as still remain unshipped at any temping discount, and in fact many will not undertake to deliver further cargoes to this country until the opening of the navigation in spring.\nLONDON TIMBER SALES.\nOctober 21st. Messrs. SIMSON & MASON held a public sale at the \"Baltic,\" Threadneedle Street. There was an average attendance, but from the amount of business transacted it is evident that London dealers will not purchase beyond what is absolutely necessary to supply their most pressing wants, though a large number remained for the stave sale, only a few lots producing any bidding.\nThe following goods were offered :—\n700 loads Danzig fir timber.\n150 „ Riga do.\n500 „ Magdalen River and Picton birch.\n200 „ pitch pine\n650 „ Swedish and Danzig balks.\n250 „ Quebec oak planks.\n150 „ Danzig do.\n600 Danzig deck deals.",
