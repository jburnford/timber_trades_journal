HOLLOWAY'S PILLS
Sir SAMUEL BAKER,
In his work on the Sources of the Nile, says:—
"I ordered my dragoman Mahomet to inform the "Faky that I was a doctor, and that I had the best "medicines at the service of the sick, with advice "gratis. In a short time I had many applicants, to "whom I served out a quantity of Holloway's Pills. "These are most useful to an explorer, as, possessing "undeniable purgative properties, they create an "undeniable effect upon the patient, which satisfies "him of their value."
This fine Medicine cures all disorders of the Liver, Stomach, Kidneys and Bowels, is a Great PURIFIER of the BLOOD, and wonderfully efficacious in all ailments incidental to Females—young or aged.

GRATEFUL—COMFORTING.
EPPS'S COCOA.
"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which "govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and "by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast "tables with a delicately flavoured beverage which may "save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the "judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution "may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist "every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies "are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is "a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by "keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a "properly nourished frame."—See article in the Civil Service Gazette.
