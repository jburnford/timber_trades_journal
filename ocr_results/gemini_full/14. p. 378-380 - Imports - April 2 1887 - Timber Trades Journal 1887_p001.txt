THE ST. JOHN FAILURES.
We quote the following from the Montreal Herald of March 14th :—
“No clear explanation of the failure of the Maritime Bank, of St. John, N.B., has come to hand, and we notice that the press of that city is expressing great dissatisfaction with the reticence of the directors. The president of the bank has been in Montreal for a day or two, but it does not appear that he has communicated any information to the public or the press calculated to throw light upon the bank’s collapse. Meantime, however, reports are being telegraphed from St. John of a sensational character, well adapted to injure the standing of business houses without really adding to the information which the public have already received. It has been stated, for instance, that the firm of R. A. & J. Stewart, doing business in St. John and Miramichi, New Brunswick, have been the cause of the bank’s failure, the fact being that the bank was closed for several days before any of R. A. & J. Stewart’s paper went to protest. No note or exchange or other liability of Messrs. Stewart had become due and was unpaid when the bank collapsed, nor was the suspension of Messrs. Stewart immediately due to its relations with the Maritime Bank. When the bank went down, R. A. & J. Stewart were carrying on their business in the usual way and had met every engagement of theirs in the promptest manner. Its difficulty was created in England by injurious reports cabled from Canada, and growing in part out of a serious blunder in another bank which refused to cash some of its checks when there were ample funds in the bank to meet them, and these funds were afterwards paid over to the Stewarts on demand. This refusal and the sensational reports telegraphed to England in reference to their connection with the Maritime Bank had the effect of impairing Messrs. Stewart’s credit, compelling their temporary suspension. We are inclined to think that Messrs. Stewart were the means of keeping the Maritime Bank on its feet at the time of the Carvill-McKean failure, and that the bank has leaned on the Stewarts rather than the Stewarts on the bank. From information which we have from St. John we learn that the Messrs. Stewart were anxious, and proposed some time since to the directors, to pay off the whole of their indebtedness, but had they done so the bank would have been unable to carry through their then existing “dead” accounts. The figures mentioned have been grossly exaggerated, and in the event of a forced degradation the heaviest sufferers will be the Messrs. Stewart and their friends who came to their relief during the serious illness of their senior partner, who has not been able to attend to business for nearly three months. London cables state that much sympathy is expressed for the firm in commercial circles.
“To reach a full understanding of the causes of the bank’s failure is impossible in the absence of a detailed statement of the bank’s affairs, but in financial circles the opinion is current that the directors have sadly mismanaged the bank’s resources. It is said they have been for some time running a large lumbering business of their own, which has not been profitable; that the bank has been interested in railroading and manufacturing; that it had a number of heavy “dead” accounts, and that, generally speaking, the directors have been taking risks which were not justified, considering their limited capital and the fact that they were trading largely on the money of depositors. It may suit the interests of members of the board to throw the blame on this or that concern or on the president himself, or place it on any shoulders but their own, but our information leads us to the opinion that the exposure, which must come, will show a rotten state of things for which the directors, as a body, are responsible. We are very far from saying that anything in the nature of fraud taints the management, but we believe we are justified in saying there has been gross mismanagement which will be revealed as soon as the facts are laid before the public.”

THE “CLUNY” TELEPHONE.
This is an invention of Mr. McPherson, of Cluny, N.B., a brother to Mr. McPherson, timber merchant, of Macduff. It is a very ingenious and efficient acoustic telephone,

TIMBER BROKERS. E. JANSSON & CO., 50, Bishopsgate St. Within, LONDON, E.C.

for short distances it is superior to the ordinary electric telephone or speaking tubes. It is likewise cheap and easily applied, being in no way the subject of royalties or dues. The diaphragm is so sensitive that it permits conversation to be carried on in ordinary tones without approaching it, or even in a whisper inaudible to any person in the room. It is, therefore, admirably adapted for connecting workshops and yard buildings with the office, for use in collieries, hotels, clubs, ships, wharves, &c. It is manufactured by the Cluny Telephone Co., St. Stephen’s Chambers, Telegraph Street, London, E.C.
