It would appear that the debtor commenced business eighteen years ago, that in 1885 and 1886 he undertook certain contracts for the erection of schools, and a drill hall at East Ham, and a police station at Wanstead, in respect of which he incurred losses to the amount of £2,700, to which he attributes his failure.
He states that all the moneys due to him under the contracts have been received, excepting retention money, amounting to £250, in respect of the police station contract, his claim to which he made over to his timber merchants.
It was stated that the bankrupt was too ill to attend for examination, and the meeting was accordingly adjourned to May 4th.

BULLING, S., builder, Upton, Essex.—The receiving order in this case was made in July last, upon the petition of Messrs. Deason & Son, timber merchants, Stratford, and the bankrupt applied on Wednesday for his order of discharge.
The debts were stated in the accounts at £233 14s. 8d., and the assets at £205 19s.
The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had not kept proper books of account, and Mr. Registrar Giffard suspended the order of discharge for two months.

COLLIER, RICHARD GEO.—This case was reported last week.
On Thursday this debtor appeared for public examination at the Brighton Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. A. O. Jennings, Registrar.
He was examined by the Official Receiver, Mr. A. Mackintosh.
Debtor formerly in business at Bognor, where he commenced with a small capital advanced by his father and uncle, the former of whom gave him the money.
Ultimately he failed, and a composition of 10s. in the pound was paid, several creditors receiving 15s. in the pound.
He then started at Worthing, his father giving him £10 and his aunt a similar sum.
He borrowed money, on which he paid interest at the rate of 60 per cent.
His trade profits amounted to 25 per cent.
Ultimately the examination was adjourned for the production of certain accounts.

COOPER & BARROW, builders, Dante Road, Newington Butts, S.E.—The receiving order in this case was made upon the petition of Messrs. Bryceson Bros., timber merchants, of 23, Park Place, Islington Green, and Cooper appeared for his public examination on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard.
Debts appeared at £217 15s. 11d., and assets nil.
Upon examination the bankrupt stated that these proceedings commenced in January, 1885, and he admitted that he did not attend the first meeting.
He did not intend any disrespect to the Court.
He was not aware that Mr. Brody, a timber merchant, had a judgment against him for a debt of £40, and therefore, had not scheduled him as a creditor.
He had not heard of his partner, Barrow, for some time, and did not know where he was.
He had bought timber from Messrs. Bryceson Bros., and he did not think he had sold any of it at a loss, except some to Messrs. Pulling & Co. for £10 or £12 for joists, and such as were of no use to him.
The bankrupt closed his examination.

CURTIS, WILLIAM H. C., builder, Poole. —At the Poole Bankruptcy Court, on the 24th ult., Mr. W. C. Powning, solicitor, of Salisbury, applied on behalf of Mr. W. H. Baker, of Salisbury, the trustee of this bankrupt estate, for leave to disclaim four building agreements which debtor entered into previous to the receiving order.
The application was unopposed, and formal evidence of notice having been given, his Honour granted the application.

DAY, GEORGE, carpenter and decorator, House Street, W.—The receiving order in this case was made on February 22nd upon the petition of Mr. A. Clifford, of 86, Leadenhall Street, and the first meeting was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Brougham, Assistant Receiver.
The debts were stated in the accounts at £461 7s. 10d., and the assets at £43 1s. 7d., the principal creditors being:—

The debtor, who had already been adjudicated bankrupt, made no proposals and his affairs will accordingly be wound up by the Official Receiver.

DAW, PHILIP, builder, Stourport.—On Friday, 25th ult., this debtor came up for his public examination at the Kidderminster Court, before Mr. Registrar Talbot.
In reply to the Official Receiver, Mr. E. P. Jobson, the debtor stated that he commenced business about nine years ago without capital, persons giving him credit.
His liabilities amounted to nearly £400, his assets nil.
He had lost upon nearly every contract he had accepted; in one instance, where he had erected four cottages, he had lost as much as £130.
He admitted that he did not go to the trouble of preparing estimates, but simply guessed at the prices, them, taking good care to quote lower than any other contractors; in consequence he had some money when they married, but over that he had no control; he however, admitted that some furniture was removed secretly from his house about Christmas last.
The registrar said that the debtor's answers were most unsatisfactory, and he should adjourn the examination sine die.

DUNFORD, JAMES, builder and contractor, 3, Hill Street, Poole.—The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was recently held at the London Hotel, Poole, under the presidency of Mr. J. Keith Dowden, Deputy Official Receiver.
The statement of affairs showed liabilities to unsecured creditors £357 1s. 5d., fully secured £5,968, estimated value of securities £8,075, surplus £2,107; assets: stock-in-trade £35, good book debts £13 6s. 1d., cash £2 2s. 6d., other property £10, surplus from

securities in the hands of creditors fully secured £2,107, less amount due to preferential creditors (payable in full) £252 10s. 1d.; net assets £2,112 18s. 6d., and showing an estimated surplus of £1,255 17s. 1d.
The causes of failure were put as insufficiency of capital, property at a fair value.
The Official Receiver's observations were, it appears, that the debtor's stock-in-trade, plant, and household furniture have been seized by the sheriff's officer, the bill of sale holder, and the County Court bailiff.
In answer to the statutory questions, the debtor said he commenced business in November, 1881, with a capital of £100.
He had £200 in hand, and nothing at the bank, at the date of his petition.
His life was insured in the Queen Insurance Company for £100, and the policy was at the National Provincial Bank, Poole, as security for advance.
Two judgments had been issued against him, and two auction sales had taken place.
He had executed a bill of sale on his furniture on December 17th, 1886, and the holder had levied and sold under his bill, the proceeds of the sale being in the hands of Messrs. Curtis & Sons, auctioneers, Poole, who, however, have since been ordered to pay them into Court, as an interpleaded action is pending in reference to them.
He suspended payment of his debts on March 3rd, 1887.
He did not consider he was insolvent; if he had disposed of his property at a fair value he would have had a surplus.
Mr. William Baker, accountant, Minster Street, Salisbury, was appointed trustee, the remuneration to be left to the Board of Trade.
No committee of inspection was appointed, the duties that would devolve on its members are to be carried out by the Board of Trade.
The following are the principal creditors:—

ESDAILE & CO., machine sawyers and timber merchants, Wenlock Road and Nicholas Lane, E.C.—The following is a summary of the accounts filed under this failure:—Liabilities: creditors unsecured, £28,366 1s. 8d.; creditors fully secured, £8,600, estimated value of securities, £8,600; creditors partly secured, £28,976 4s. 10d.; less estimated value of securities, £24,900 (of the sum of £25,000, £8,400 is disputed); liabilities on bills other than debtors' own acceptances, £24,437 1s. 8d. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend; preferential creditors for rent, taxes, &c., £5,519 11s. 3d., which leaves a sum of £5,519 11s. 3d. for preferential creditors, and a contra deduction of £5,519 11s. 3d.
The total liabilities are thus £72,352 18s. 1d., and of £38,932 3s. 4d. is expected to rank for dividend.
Assets: cash in hand, £1,000; cash at banks, £59 2s. 6d.; stock-in-trade, £6,000; estimated cost, £9,287 10s. 6d.; machinery, fixtures, tools, &c., £15,000 (estimated cost, £15,100); horses, £200; furniture at Nicholas Lane, £100; book debts, good, £5,330 14s. 1d., less 20 per cent., £4,264 11s. 3d.; doubtful and bad, £3,000 7s. 10d., of which £312 11s. is doubtful; bills of exchange, £509 2s. 6d., expected to produce £325 4s.; other property, £1,000; total, £15,966 8s. 9d., which, after deducting £5,519 11s. 3d. for preferential creditors, leaves net assets at £10,446 17s. 6d., and a deficiency of £28,485 5s. 10d.
The Official Receiver's observations are as follows:—The receiving order was made on the 21st January, on the debtors' own petition, and on the 25th Mr. Henry Brown, of 19, Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, S.W., accountant, was appointed special manager of the estate and business until the first meeting, such appointment appearing to be necessary, and in the interests of the creditors generally.
The debtors state that the business was originally established in the year 1810 or thereabouts, and that there were several changes in the partnership of the firm down to 1869, in which year they became partners, the other partner at that time being Mr. Edward Esdaile, and Mr. Theodore Sheath, the latter of whom retired in or about 1877 (the firm agreeing to pay him an annuity of £150), the remaining partners then consisting of Mr. Edward Esdaile and the present debtors, but that from about 1880 Mr. E. Esdaile ceased to take an active part in the business, receiving an annuity of £500 (afterwards reduced to £300) in lieu of profits.
Mr. Edward Esdaile not having been joined in the petition, the question as to his position as a partner was raised, and this has caused some delay in summoning the meeting.
It is now proposed to meet the difficulty by Mr. Edward Esdaile disclaiming all interest in the partnership estate.
The debtors state that they did not bring in any capital upon joining the firm, but the former capital in the business (about £15,000 standing in the names of the executors of the late Mr. James Esdaile, exclusive of other family moneys) was left in as a loan, and in 1872 was paid out by means of a fresh loan from another member of the family.
The business was profitable down to the year 1884, but between that time and 1886 the firm made heavy losses and was met by the remission of family claims to the amount of about £30,000.
These remissions being taken into account, the firm's affairs according to a balance-sheet or statement of liabilities and assets dated 30th June, 1884, showed an approximate surplus of £14,073.
The drawings of the partners from the business since that date have been: Mr. E. M. Esdaile, £1,814 2s. 4d.; Mr. A. W. Peat, £2,599 5s.; and the amount of bad debts written off from June, 1885, to January, 1887, is put down at £6,054 12s. 8d.
The debtors attribute their failure to the greatly reduced demand for veneers for which the mills were originally built, and from which business the profits were largely derived; the falling off in the returns from the mill trades generally, owing to the prevailing depression and the concurrent reduction in rates through competition; the unproductive holding of the Imperial Mills, which have not been worked for many years past; excessive bad debts consequent on the depression in the timber and building trades; and to insufficiency of capital for a fixed scale of trading commensurate with the heavy charges of the business.
The books have been well kept, but they have not been fully balanced and proper balance-sheets have not been prepared, but statements of liabilities and assets have been made out from time to time, the last dated the 30th June, 1884, showing an approximate surplus (valuing the assets as a going concern) of £14,073, as above mentioned.
The unsecured and other cash debts include claims of family liabilities.
The debtors' statements of their private affairs show:—Mr. E. M. Esdaile—net liabilities, £1,769 18s. 1d.; net assets, £162 10s. 7d.; deficiency, £1,607 9s. 6d.
Mr. A. W. Peat,—net liabilities, £858 9s. 10d.; net assets, £582 5s.; deficiency, £276 4s. 10d.

EVANS, THOMAS JOSEPH, contractor, 2, Fronfelen, Barmouth, Merioneth.—A receiving order was made against this debtor on the 19th March last, on his own petition, at the Aberystwith County Court.
The statement of affairs shows:—

APRIL 2, 1887.]
£24,900 (of the sum of £25,000, £8,400 is disputed); liabilities on bills other than debtors' own acceptances, which £24,437 1s. 8d. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend; preferential creditors for rent, taxes, &c., £5,519 11s. 3d., which leaves a sum of £5,519 11s. 3d. for preferential creditors, and a contra deduction of £5,519 11s. 3d.
The total liabilities are thus £72,352 18s. 1d., and of £38,932 3s. 4d. is expected to rank for dividend.
Assets: cash in hand, £1,000; cash at banks, £59 2s. 6d.; stock-in-trade, £6,000; estimated cost, £9,287 10s. 6d.; machinery, fixtures, tools, &c., £15,000 (estimated cost, £15,100); horses, £200; furniture at Nicholas Lane, £100; book debts, good, £5,330 14s. 1d., less 20 per cent., £4,264 11s. 3d.; doubtful and bad, £3,000 7s. 10d., of which £312 11s. is doubtful; bills of exchange, £509 2s. 6d., expected to produce £325 4s.; other property, £1,000; total, £15,966 8s. 9d., which, after deducting £5,519 11s. 3d. for preferential creditors, leaves net assets at £10,446 17s. 6d., and a deficiency of £28,485 5s. 10d.
The Official Receiver's observations are as follows:—The receiving order was made on the 21st January, on the debtors' own petition, and on the 25th Mr. Henry Brown, of 19, Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, S.W., accountant, was appointed special manager of the estate and business until the first meeting, such appointment appearing to be necessary, and in the interests of the creditors generally.
