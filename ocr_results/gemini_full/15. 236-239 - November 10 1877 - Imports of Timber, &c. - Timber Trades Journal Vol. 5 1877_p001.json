Prices obtained were—\nCrown red ... 11 x 3 ... 5 1/2d.\nDo. do. ... 9 x 3 ... 3 1/2d.\nDo. white ... 11 x 3 ... 3 1/2d.\nDo. do. ... 11 x 3 ... 2 1/2d.\nDo. do. ... 7 x 2 1/2 ... 1 3/4d.\nSecond red ... 11 x 3 ... 3 1/2d.\nRed deals ... ... ... 1 3/4d.\nWhite do. ... ... ... 1 3/4d.\nSeveral other lots were offered as advertised, but did not find buyers.\nMessrs. Risk and Co.’s sale, advertised for the 13th, has been postponed in consequence of their vessel the East, from Quebec, having put into a port in Norway in distress.\nMessrs. Wm. Thomson and Co. will, however, offer for sale on that day at the Victoria Docks yellow pine deals and battens.\n\nDUNDEE.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nSince I last reported, trade has on the whole been good.\nThe arrivals are fair as per my return.\nTwo firms in the building line have in both cases a pretty good realization.\nIt is now understood that the firm of Wm. Kirkland and Son, Dundee Saw-mills, are to retire from the timber trade.\nTheir stock is now all disposed of, and the machinery, &c., is being catalogued for sale on an early day.\nThe Harbour Trustees have at last moved in the matter of timber ponds, and their engineer has prepared for approval a plan for a pond of 45 acres to the east of the dock.\n\nBRISTOL.\n(From Messrs. G. M. Barnes & King’s Circular.)\nCanon’s Marsh, Nov. 1st, 1877.\nThere has been a fair demand during the past month, and owing to falling off in the importation as compared with the corresponding month last year (excluding Quebec yellow pine imported for railway purposes), we may consider that the stocks are not excessive, although ample to meet the requirements of the winter.\nWe do not anticipate any further heavy importation, as the season is now drawing to a close.\nQuebec Goods.—Yellow and red pine are but lightly in request.\nOak, elm, and ash—demand light.\nBirch—fair demand.\nDeals have been fairly inquired for, and prices are firm.\nStaves and lathwood quiet.\nNew Brunswick Goods.—Spruce deals still come forward freely; the demand has been fair, but we cannot look for any improvement in prices until the importation is closed.\nBaltic Timber.—There is a slight improvement in the demand for Memel fir timber, but no inquiries for oak.\nSwedish timber is not in great request, and the stocks are sufficient.\nBaltic Deals.—There is a fair demand for most descriptions, especially for first quality and building deals.\nPrepared Flooring.—There has been a good demand during the past month, and prices are somewhat firmer.\nPitch Pine Timber.—There is sufficient stock, as the demand has not been large.\nMahogany, &c.—A cargo was sold by auction on the 23rd October, and realized good prices.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From October 25th to November 7th.\nHewn Timber (loads).\nRussia—950 Burt & Co.\n590 J.
