DUNDEE.
(From our own Correspondent.)
Since I last reported, trade has on the whole been good.
The arrivals are fair as per my return.
Two firms in the building line have in both cases a pretty good realization.
It is now understood that the firm of Wm. Kirkland and Son, Dundee Saw-mills, are to retire from the timber trade.
Their stock is now all disposed of, and the machinery, &c., is being catalogued for sale on an early day.
The Harbour Trustees have at last moved in the matter of timber ponds, and their engineer has prepared for approval a plan for a pond of 45 acres to the east of the dock.

BRISTOL.
(From Messrs. G. M. Barnes & King’s Circular.)
Canon’s Marsh, Nov. 1st, 1877.
There has been a fair demand during the past month, and owing to falling off in the importation as compared with the corresponding month last year (excluding Quebec yellow pine imported for railway purposes), we may consider that the stocks are not excessive, although ample to meet the requirements of the winter.
We do not anticipate any further heavy importation, as the season is now drawing to a close.
Quebec Goods.—Yellow and red pine are but lightly in request.
Oak, elm, and ash—demand light.
Birch—fair demand.
Deals have been fairly inquired for, and prices are firm.
Staves and lathwood quiet.
New Brunswick Goods.—Spruce deals still come forward freely; the demand has been fair, but we cannot look for any improvement in prices until the importation is closed.
Baltic Timber.—There is a slight improvement in the demand for Memel fir timber, but no inquiries for oak.
Swedish timber is not in great request, and the stocks are sufficient.
Baltic Deals.—There is a fair demand for most descriptions, especially for first quality and building deals.
Prepared Flooring.—There has been a good demand during the past month, and prices are somewhat firmer.
Pitch Pine Timber.—There is sufficient stock, as the demand has not been large.
Mahogany, &c.—A cargo was sold by auction on the 23rd October, and realized good prices.
