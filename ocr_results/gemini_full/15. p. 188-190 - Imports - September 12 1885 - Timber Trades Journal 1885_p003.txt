Mr. Pearce (a creditor) said the bankrupt told him a month ago that he had got £400 on the property he had mortgaged. It was decided to adjudicate the debtor bankrupt.
RAILWAY AND CANAL TRADERS' ASSOCIATION.—At the ordinary monthly meeting of the Council of the Railway and Canal Traders' Association, held at the offices, Eastcheap Buildings, last week, the following resolution was carried unanimously:—"That as the General Election is now near at hand this Council urges upon voters the necessity of ascertaining clearly the views of Parliamentary candidates upon the shown by the action of the companies preference traders, and also the unjust to foreign traders, the excessive charges for station accommodation, terminal, the companies in addition to their authorised maximum rates, and is of opinion that no candidate should be supported unless he pledges to protect the interests of railway and canal in relation to such subjects."
