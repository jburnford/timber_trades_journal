There are but two vessels now open for business, and advanced rates will probably be obtained as the inquiry for grain is good with prospects of over 8s. being paid.\nThe fall short to date numbers 221 vessels, 175,713 tons, compared with last year.\nQuotations are :—London, 40s. timber, 95s. deals.

This artist, whose name is Oestergren, and who is a native of the obscure town of Westeras, in Sweden, is making ready for the forthcoming Philadelphia Exhibition a set of chessmen intended to typify the struggle of opinion now going on in Germany. On the one side the struggle of opinion the Empress Augusta is the queen, Prince Bismarck and the Minister of Public Instruction, Herr Falk, the bishops; the knights are Uhlans, and the pawns recruited of the landwehr. Their adversaries are the Pope, of course as king, while an abbess figures as queen; the bishops are cardinals, monks mounted on asses represent the knights, and the pawns are monks on foot.",
