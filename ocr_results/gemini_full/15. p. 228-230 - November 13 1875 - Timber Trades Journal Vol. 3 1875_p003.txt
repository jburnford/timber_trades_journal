FREIGHTS.
QUEBEC, Oct. 22nd.—There is but slight change to note in the Freight Market, rates continue about the same. There are but two vessels now open for business, and advanced rates will probably be obtained as the inquiry for grain is good with prospects of over 8s. being paid.

Quotations are :—London, 40s. timber, 95s. deals. Liverpool, 40s. hardwood, 37s. 6d. pine, and 92s. 6d. deals. Bristol, 38s. pine. Clyde, 35s. to 36s. timber.

TREES FOR PORTLAND-PLACE.—At a meeting of the Marylebone Vestry on the 28th ult., it was unanimously resolved, on the motion of Mr. Harlowe—"That it be referred to a special committee to consider and report as to the practicability and advisability of planting a row of suitable trees throughout its entire length on each side of Portland-place." Mr. Harlowe, on moving his resolution, referred to the pleasant aspect which the planting of trees gave to the Boulevards of Paris, Brussels, and of other Continental cities, and to the adaptability of the only thoroughfare in the metropolis that is Portland-place (almost so) to similar treatment.—Builder.

An ingenious Swedish wood-carver has hit on a way of applying the game of chess to political and religious controversy. This artist, whose name is Oestergren, and who is a native of the obscure town of Westeras, in Sweden, is making ready for the forthcoming Philadelphia Exhibition a set of chessmen intended to typify the struggle of opinion now going on in Germany. On the one side the struggle of opinion the Empress Augusta is the queen, Prince Bismarck and the Minister of Public Instruction, Herr Falk, the bishops; the knights are Uhlans, and the pawns recruited of the landwehr. Their adversaries are the Pope, of course as king, while an abbess figures as queen; the bishops are cardinals, monks mounted on asses represent the knights, and the pawns are monks on foot.
