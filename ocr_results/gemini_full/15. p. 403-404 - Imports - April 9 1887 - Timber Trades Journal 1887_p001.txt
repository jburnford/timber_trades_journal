No doubt some severe gales may open it up, but the exceptionally few storms we have had up to the present lead one to think that that navigation will open in many places much earlier than usual.
In Helsingfors, however, we have open water, a large steamer having been “sawn” in on the 26th April.

provided with suitable means of preventing end play.
The top cutter block has an arrangement that enables it to clear away the thin part of the moulding; this allows the cutters to be shorter, and to produce better work than when they are fixed on a cutter block placed parallel to the table.
All the spindles are made of a quality of steel well adapted for high speed, and the cutter blocks of the top and bottom cutters are each forged solid with their spindles.
The machine is quite “self contained,” and only requires one belt from the line shafting.
The countershaft for driving the various cutters is fixed to the rear end of the machine, and is fitted with all the necessary pulleys.

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
GUY AND OTHERS v. CHURCHILL AND SIM.
This matter was mentioned on Saturday last to Lords Justices Cotton, Lindley & Fry, sitting in the Court of Appeal of the High Court of Judicature, by Mr. Pike on behalf of plaintiffs on a question of costs.
The learned counsel stated that he understood he had no opponent, as he had given notice to the other side, but they had expressed their intention of not appearing, and stated they had no objection to the course he (Mr. Pike) was asking their Lordships to adopt.
What he was now applying for from their Lordships was a declaration that the solicitors for the plaintiffs in this action should have a charge or lien on a sum of £298 and some odd shillings which their Lordships had ordered should be repaid by the defendants to the plaintiffs.
The order in question had been made under the following circumstances:— The original action was an action which was carried on before Mr. Justice Stirling, and was by him dismissed with costs.
Notice of appeal was then given, and before that appeal was allowed to be prosecuted, the plaintiffs were ordered to pay the amount of the costs of the trial into Court.
This was accordingly done, and their Lordships on the appeal had reversed the order of Mr. Justice Stirling, and had ruled that the costs of the trial in the Court below should be repaid to the plaintiffs.
It was with reference to these costs that he was asking the Court to make a declaration that the plaintiffs’ solicitors had a lien.
Their Lordships, after some discussion, made the declaration asked.

QUEBEC CHARTERING.—“A Cardiff Small Part Owner” writes as follows to a contemporary:—“As the season for Quebec chartering is at hand, allow me through your columns to caution owners against the practice which has crept into the trade, within the last two or three years, of carrying timber away for railway purposes, and receiving freight as per specification.
The usual size is called 14 by 7, but as many pieces hold 14½, 14¼ in. wide, and 7½, 7¼, and 7⅛ in. thick, it has been found that, if measured by Customs calliper measure, there is an over-measure of some 3 per cent.
Now, 3 per cent. on a 19s. or 20s. freight means about 7d. per load, the cost of measuring (the merchant paying one moiety) being 2d. per load, leaves 5d. per load to the benefit of the ship, or about enough to pay for discharging.
Why should not sawn yellow pine be measured as sawn pitch pine is?—Verb. sap. sat.”

FOREST RESOURCES OF AMERICA.
THE following circular, issued by the Chicago Lumberman’s Exchange and approved by the Lumber Manufacturers’ Association of the north-west, has been sent out:—
It is desired to enlist your sympathy and assistance in an endeavour to obtain an inventory of the forest resources of the nation.
It is a work which can properly be accomplished only by the Forestry Division of the Bureau of Agriculture, and we learn from reliable sources that the amount allotted to that Division from the annual appropriation to the Bureau is utterly inadequate to accomplish any useful purpose.
It is desired that the Division of Forestry should place men in the various states, as rapidly as circumstances will permit, with instructions to ascertain: 1st. The amount of the various kinds of standing timber, classified. 2nd. The extent of the improved farming land—with such other useful information as may suggest itself to the Chief of Division.
And why is it desirable that this information should be obtained?
As a nation we are scarcely more than 100 years old, and yet in that time the forests of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania have parted entirely with the vast supplies of white pine which once covered their forests, and their good oak is also gone.
In these states only hemlock, spruce and hardwood, mainly of second growth, and of a vastly inferior grade as compared with the original timber growth, is to be found.
Michigan, which but fifty years ago was estimated to contain 150,000,000,000 (one hundred and fifty billion feet), is set down in the census report for 1880 at but 32,000,000,000 ft., while the annual manufacture equals 5,000,000,000 ft.
Wisconsin in the same time has been reduced, from an original supply fully equal to Michigan, to an estimate of 44,000,000,000 ft. in 1880.
Minnesota, with an original growth of perhaps 30,000,000,000 ft., was in 1880 estimated at but 11,000,000,000 remaining.
These three last-named states are supplying lumber at the rate of not far from 10,000,000,000 ft. per year, and, if the census estimates were reasonably correct, the year 1890 should show an almost entire extinction of the white pine supply of the north-west.
While, perhaps, the estimates were far too low, the poorer grade of the supply of each succeeding year is speaking as no figures can do of the fact that the pine supply of the north-west is drawing uncomfortably nigh to a period of utter exhaustion.
Of oak, which for many years was a staple production of Michigan, it may truthfully be said that it has disappeared; for a while a large amount of inferior timber suited only for saw logs may yet remain, the seeker after staves and square timber for ship-building is compelled to look to other and more remote regions.
The vast timber resources of states further south, as Ohio and Indiana, have been culled over until little is to be found except that which but a few years ago was rejected as of no value.
With an average consumptive demand equalling 500 ft. per capital the 60,000,000 people of the United States require 30,000,000,000 ft. per year of the sawed products of the forests, in addition to their firewood.
How long the now extensive forests of the south can stand the strain, which (with a smaller population) has so nearly exhausted

the once supposed inexhaustible forests of the north.
Our Canadian neighbours, who have been hitherto thought the possessors of unlimited forests of pine, have already taken the alarm, and ascertaining that in eight years the timber trade of Montreal has increased from 3,800,000 ft. in 1878 to over 100,000,000 ft. in 1886, now propose to increase the export duty upon the manufactured product, in order to conserve and protect her forests from speedy extinction.
Under these circumstances, is it not for the interest and advantage of every citizen of the United States, be he farmer, merchant, professional man, or labourer, that a reliable inventory of the present and still remaining forest resources of the country should be speedily undertaken, in order that, with an intelligent appreciation of the facts, waste may be prevented, and the commercial, agricultural, and manufacturing interests of the nation may, to the fullest extent, be protected?
It is firmly believed that, when the importance of the subject shall be appreciated by our legislators, there will be no delay in providing the Bureau of Forestry of the United States with ample means for inventorying the timber resources.
To this end your influence and vote is requested.
