THE Norwegian Government have submitted to the Storthing a bill authorising the Treasury to grant a subvention of 120,000 kroner per year for three years to a navigation service between Bergen and Great Britain. It is proposed that vessels shall sail thrice a week from Bergen, alternately for Newcastle and Leith. The subvention granted to the service from Christiania to Fredrikshavn is to be withdrawn. Hitherto the postal service has been via Jutland and Germany, and it is said that this new proposal to divert the mail service from Christiania to Fredrikshald, it is stated, meets with lively opposition in Norway itself.

ASHCROFT, PETER, Timber Merchant, 50, Bishopsgate Street Within, E.C.—In this case Mr. Justice Cave (sitting in bankruptcy) gave judgment on Wednesday upon the application which had been made, on behalf of the trustee of the estate, to set aside a settlement executed by the bankrupt after his marriage. By the settlement, which was dated April 27th, 1877, the bankrupt assigned to trustees certain Dutch Rhenish Railway shares for the benefit of his wife. On the execution of the settlement the bankrupt handed over the scrip for the shares, and notice was given to the secretary of the company that the shares were the property of the trustees of the settlement. In February, 1886, the bankrupt executed a transfer of the shares in question to the trustees, but the said transfer was never actually registered in the books of the company, the shares remaining in the bankrupt's name up to the date of the receiving order, which was made in April, 1886. The trustees under the bankruptcy claimed the shares under section 47 of the Act, upon the ground that the failure had occurred within ten years of the date of the settlement. The bankrupt alleged, however, that he was solvent at the time, but was unable to give any details of his assets and liabilities. Mr. Justice Cave, in giving judgment, said that in April, 1877, the bankrupt, who was then in partnership with one Storey, was minded to make a settlement on his wife and children. At that time he was possessed, among other property, of furniture, plate, and household effects, of a reversionary interest in some bank annuities and stock, and of the Dutch Rhenish Railway shares in question. By an indenture of the 27th April, 1877, after reciting his title to the above-mentioned property, and that he was desirous of settling the whole of it upon trust for the benefit of his wife, himself, and his children, and for the purpose of effectuating that interest was about to transfer the shares into the names of Todd & Miller, it was witnessed that Ashcroft assigned to Todd & Miller the plate, furniture, and effects, and his interests in the bank annuities and stock to hold—as to the plate, furniture and effects on the trusts thereinafter declared for the benefit of his wife, himself, and their children. By the same indenture it was further agreed that Todd & Miller should stand possessed of the bank annuities and stocks, and also of the shares so soon as the same should be transferred to them upon trust, to pay the dividend to his wife during her life for her separate use without power of anticipation, and after her death on further trusts for the benefit of the settler and his children. At the time of the execution of the deed the certificates of the shares were handed over to Todd & Miller, and on the 17th May, 1877, Ashcroft's solicitors gave a written notice to the trustees of Peter Ashcroft's will, in whom the bank annuities and stock were vested, and also to the Dutch Rhenish Railway Company, that the eighty shares were directed to be held by Todd & Miller upon the trusts therein mentioned. No transfer of the shares to Todd & Miller was executed until the 19th February, 1886, and Ashcroft continued to receive the dividends and apply them to his own use. On the 21st April, 1886, Ashcroft filed his petition, and on the 30th April he was adjudged bankrupt. It was first contended that the settlement was void under Section 47, on the ground that the settler was insolvent at the time of making such settlement. It had, however, been proved to his lordship's satisfaction that Ashcroft was then able to pay all his debts without the aid of the property comprised in the settlement. Ashcroft's interest in the shares did not in fact pass until the 19th February, 1886, but it was contended that there was a complete declaration of trust by which Ashcroft constituted himself a trustee of the shares in the trusts contained in the indenture. The late Master of the Rolls said "To constitute a valid declaration of trust, the owner must so deal with the property as to deprive himself of its beneficial ownership, and declare that he will hold it from that time forward on trust for the other person." His Lordship was of opinion that it was the intention of the settler to transfer the shares to Todd & Miller, on the trusts declared, and not to constitute himself a trustee. The shares therefore passed to the trustee under the bankruptcy, and the application would be granted.
