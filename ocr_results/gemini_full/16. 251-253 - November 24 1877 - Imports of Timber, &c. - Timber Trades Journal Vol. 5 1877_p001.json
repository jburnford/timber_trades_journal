Wright and Breakenridge’s sale at Greenock on the 22nd inst. the attendance of buyers was not large, probably owing to the inclemency of the weather, and the circumstance of the sale being held out of doors.

Tellefsen, Wills, and Co.’s Circular, Nov. 13th.)\nThe demand for pitwood has fallen off considerably, in consequence of the partial work at the collieries reducing their requirements. The arrivals have been heavy, so that prices are less firm, and we are confirmed in the opinion we expressed in our last on this subject.\nNorwegian mining timber stocks in Cardiff are gradually lessening, so that prices for this class of wood are likely to advance.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From November 8th to 21st.\nHewn Timber (loads).\nRussia—625 Burt & Co.\n183 Other Importers.\nPrussia—620 Churchill & Sim.\n412 Burt & Co.\n117 Other Importers.\nSweden— 760 Churchill & Sim.\nB.
