LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.)
November 22nd, 1877.
Importations for the last fortnight are 35 vessels, and their cargoes consist of 12 deals and battens, 3 Baltic timber, 12 Quebec timber, 12 pit props, 4 square sleepers, and various parcels staves, lathwood, &c.
The timber trade is dull and languid. Very little doing.
Messrs. W. Thomson and Co. exposed for sale, on the 13th, at the Albert Docks, yellow pine deals, battens, &c. Very few buyers were present.
There was no competition, and the auctioneer had great difficulty in finding purchasers.
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. offered for sale, at the head of Queen’s Dock, on the 20th, deals, battens, &c. There was a good attendance but a limited demand; several lots were passed over. American pine deals found buyers at 2s. 8d., and 2s. 9d. per cubic foot.
Messrs. Jas. Duncan and Co. will have an extensive sale, on the 11th proximo, in their yard, Seafield, as per advertisement.

CARDIFF.
(From Messrs. Tellefsen, Wills, and Co.’s Circular, Nov. 13th.)
The demand for pitwood has fallen off considerably, in consequence of the partial work at the collieries reducing their requirements. The arrivals have been heavy, so that prices are less firm, and we are confirmed in the opinion we expressed in our last on this subject.
Norwegian mining timber stocks in Cardiff are gradually lessening, so that prices for this class of wood are likely to advance.
