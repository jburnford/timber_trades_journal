NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," November 10th.)
A slightly monotonous state of affairs is found on the general lumber market, most dealers reporting "nothing new," and business appearing to move along in much the same channel as recorded for some time past.
There is no speculative feeling of decided character extant that we can discover, and an absence of basis for excitement in any form, the conservative tendencies of both buyers and sellers proving a healthy and still favour the belief that in filling encouraging feature.
Indications up for the winter an effort will be made to keep the amount on a close limit of probable consumptive and distributive wants, both as regards quantity and selection, with a chance that caution in this direction may in some cases be carried too far.
Experience, however, has taught some severe lessons during the past three or four years, and the trade believe it is better to take the risk of a temporary shortage than to indulge in investments beyond the wants of the period between crops, especially as business has settled into such form as to permit a calculation of these wants with a considerable degree of certainty.
The "short crop" bugbear appears to have had rather a bad summer of it, and has, no doubt, retired to his hole to recuperate for the regular winter and spring cry of "no logs" and "scant water," with variations on the absence of snow, &c., leaving most of the primary markets with a fair to good stock of lumber seeking sale at prices by no means high considering the season.
The "little" three years which was to exhaust our standing lumber have also passed, and yet the preparations being made for the winter onslaught upon the forests seem to indicate that the lumbermen expect to find "a few more left."

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," November 1st.)
The cargo market has had another fit of sickness; it is convalescent this morning, however, and hopes are entertained of its speedy recovery if no relapse is experienced.
The receipts of lumber during the week ending October 30th amounted to 40,375,000 feet, or a little more than the total receipts of the corresponding week last year.
This brings the total receipts by lake for the season up to within 3,000,000 feet of last year.
From Friday to Tuesday the amount was something like 30,000,000, and it proved altogether too much for the market to stand up under.
Some grades of boards and strips weakened also, but not sufficiently to warrant changing the quotations.
To-day there are only a few cargoes left at the docks, and the buyers are pretty well represented.
Lumber seems to have been thrown in here from all quarters regardless of what might be the consequences—under the stimulus of the last advance.
Several Lake Huron points sent cargoes which had before been but lightly represented.
Saginaw river, it will be observed, is still 10,000,000 feet behind last year.
