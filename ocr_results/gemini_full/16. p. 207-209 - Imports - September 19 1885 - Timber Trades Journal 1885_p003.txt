CIGAR BOXES.
THE following is an account of an interview between the reporter of a Michigan paper and the principal of a cigar-box manufactory at Grand Rapids:-
"The material of which we make our boxes?" queried the principal, pleasantly. "H'm! we use cedar, imitation, sycamore and veneered. The first is the most expensive. It is of two kinds, Cuban and Mexican or Spanish, but there is very little of the former kind used in this country at the present time. It is an imported wood cut in the mountains of Mexico and floated down the gulf. Imitation is white-wood grained to resemble cedar. It is second in expense. Sycamore is the cheapest. A little dearer is the veneered wood. Here is some of it," he said, taking up one of the wooden sheets, and showing that on one side it was plain whitewood, while on the other side it was unmistakably cedar.
"This is prepared in the following manner:-A long piece of cedar is thoroughly steamed; a long, broad sheet, from the 100th to the 160th part of an inch thick, is shaved from it and cemented to a whitewood board. When dry, this is sand-papered, and then made into cigar boxes, but few can distinguish them from real cedar without making a close examination.
I know of where veneer is made are Cincinnati and New York. The sycamore used by local factories is cut principally in this and neighbouring states and prepared here. The other materials are obtained chiefly in New York, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati, and New Orleans."
A young man was nailing together parts of boxes in an adjoining room. He used a machine which worked with a treadle, fed the nails, and drove them very rapid. Further on some girls were pasting linings, labels, and edgings on finished boxes.
"We complete our products right here," went on the gentleman, "you see we are private, others always use paper for linings. Some of the labels tinfoil was the material. We have stock labels. We has yielded to paper. For weddings we make linings with gold or silver paper, and tie the boxes with ribbon to match, but we do not frequently have any demand for that sort of thing. Although there are some labels printed on paper and pasted on the cover, the majority of them are printed on the wood itself. We use this printing press formerly the custom of branding labels and names on the boxes with a brass brand was in vogue, but the process has been abandoned for the printing press. Boxes are mostly made to order. I may say that this is universal, for very few factories keep them in stock."

THE Ferdinand Brunn, of Stettin, from Doboy for Dundee, with pitch pine, went ashore at 10 p.m. on Saturday last, near the Bell Rock. The crew landed at Arbroath on Thursday, and the vessel was floated on Thursday.
TEAK.-The latest mail advices from Bangkok express a prevailing fear that unless heavy rains should soon fall, the rice crop in Siam will be seriously damaged. The supply of teak wood at Bangkok was very limited, and was expected to continue so until the rivers were sufficiently full to float down timber from the interior. Altogether the season is considered a backward one in Siam.
ENDURANCE OF WOODS.-In some tests, made with small squares of various woods buried one inch in the ground, the following results, says the Garden, were noted:-Birch and aspen decayed in three years; willow and horse-chestnut in four years; maple and red beech in five years; elm, ash, hornbeam and Lombardy poplar in seven years; oak, Scotch fir, Weymouth pine, and silver fir decayed to a depth of half an inch in seven years, larch, juniper, and arbor vitæ were uninjured at the expiration of the seven years.
