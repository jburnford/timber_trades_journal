There is to-day, in the Tittabawassee river, one-half as many logs as will be rafted from the river this season; and if one hundred and fifty million feet more are put in on that river and its tributaries, it is all that can be gotten out; yet one firm are preparing to put in twenty million, and another, whose mill is now fully stocked, for another season's cutting, are preparing to put in ten million more. The aggregate of operations on those streams will without doubt be fully three hundred million, leaving one hundred and fifty million more to be carried over next year, to add to the present burthen of manufactured stock. This will help to depreciate the market value of lumbermen. This will help to depreciate the market value of manufactured stock, and the logs themselves will also be apt to suffer a large decline.\n\nMONTREAL\n(From the \" Ottawa Citizen.\") October 20th, 1875.\nThere is a slight increase in the local demand for lumber, as builders are anxious to close in their buildings before the setting in of cold weather. In dressed lumber there is a moderate business done. The foreign trade in lumber shows signs of improvement; the number of lumber-laden vessels that have cleared from this port up to date is twenty-six, with a tonnage of 11,548 tons. To the same date last year there cleared from this port twenty-seven lumber-laden vessels, with an aggregate of 14,000 tons.\n\nST. JOHN, N.B.\n(From the \" Quebec Chronicle.\") November 2nd, 1875.\nThe deal exports to Europe from this port for October were15,737,788, against 22,037,390 in October, 1874. For the year, so far, the shipments are 163,432,945 feet, against 190,015,521 feet the same time last year. The Telegraph estimates that the total shipments of the port this year will not exceed 185,000,000.\n\nSHEFFIELD STEEL AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY.—This company have opened London offices and sample rooms at 115, Cannon-street. We regret to announce the death of Mr. Cunningham, the proprietor of the Victoria Saw-Mill, Minerva-street, Hackney-road, which took place suddenly whilst acting as foreman of a jury.\n\nMr. GEORGE HORSLEY, Mayor of Hartlepool, member of the firm of E. S. Jobson and Co., merchants, has been appointed Vice-Consul at the Hartlepools for Sweden and Norway.\n\nSHIPMENTS FROM THE ST. LAWRENCE.—The shipments of lumber from the river St. Lawrence to the river Plate during this season, extending from July 15th to November 8th, have amounted to 10,180,795 feet. This quantity is considerably below the shipments of the five previous years.\n\nNEW ZEALAND TIMBER.—The value of New Zealand timber for ship-building purposes has been acknowledged by the Lords of the Admiralty, who have entered into a contract with Mr. J. Russell, of Auckland, to supply the department with 2,500,000 feet of spars and bulk timber annually for a term of five years.\n\nCONGRESS OF FORESTRY.—We read in the Echo Forestier that an international congress for discussing subjects appertaining to forestry is to be held next year in Rome, at which representatives from Italy, Germany, France, England, Austria, and other countries are expected to be present.\n\nIt is a popular belief that lightning will not strike a beech tree. In a recent thunder shower at Goshen, Mass, a beech and maple standing near together, with branches interlocking each other, received the electric bolt, which shattered the maple and passed into the earth through a prostrate hemlock tree lying near, which was stripped of its bark nearly the whole length. No trace of the lightning was left upon the beech.\n\nWOOD FOR JETTIES.—A fact has occurred at Belfast, Victoria, which is well worth noting. In 1868 an auger was dropped in the bay there by one of the workmen employed on the jetty. Last Christmas the tool was picked up on the beach near the mouth of the Moyne. The iron auger was encrusted with rust, sand, &c., and the iron partly destroyed, but the wooden handle (blackwood) was perfectly sound. In building jetties this fact would prove that iron bolts are not as durable as treenails of blackwood.\n\nELECTRIC WOOD SAW.—A novel invention for sawing wood has been patented. The process consists in substituting a platinum wire for the ordinary steel saw. The wire is heated to a white heat by the passage of an electric current. This wire, to which a forward and backward movement is given, cuts across the hardest woods with inconceivable ease. The platinum wire, constantly maintained at a white heat by the electric current, advances in the wood by carbonizing the surface which it touches, but this carbonization is entirely superficial, and has no bad effect.\n\n241\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From Nov. 11th to Nov. 24th, 1875.\nHewn Timber (loads).\nRussia— 2695 Burt & Co.\n150 Engstrom & Co.\n105 J.
