CORRECTION.—In our stock of wood at the Public Docks of London, on Oct. 31st, 1875, given in our last issue, the stock of lathwood should have been 1,327½ fathoms.
THE JARROW CARPENTERS AND JOINERS.—On the 13th inst. a mass meeting of the carpenters and joiners employed in the Tyne shipbuilding yards was held at Jarrow, when twenty-four rules, as drawn up by the masters, were unanimously adopted. With respect to the proposed 10 per cent. reduction, a motion was passed that the men do not submit to any such reduction. A resolution to the effect that no overtime should be worked in any of the yards until the wages question had been definitely settled, was also agreed to.
