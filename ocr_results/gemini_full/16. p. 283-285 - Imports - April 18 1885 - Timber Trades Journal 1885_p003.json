Aston Dawes).\nHe stated that he started in business as a builder and contractor six years ago, and three years since estimated that he was worth £1,800.\nIn his statement of affairs it was shown that there was a surplus of £1,180, but the bankrupt now stated that he reckoned that amount on the supposition that his property would realize the same as he had sold, although, if a forced sale were made, he expected that great difficulty would be experienced in obtaining an offer for them.\nHe had communicated with the mortgagees, and they felt inclined to allow him to realise the properties.\nHe was one of the trustees under his father's will, but could not state whether he was indebted to the estate or not.\nHis brother was the acting executor, and he had never received an account, although he had written for it.\nThe Registrar was the acting solicitor in the matter.\nMr. Wilson said that the debtor had been applied to several times for the money, but he would never come near him.\nAfter a lengthy examination, the bankrupt was allowed to pass upon the application of Mr. Fulton, solicitor.\nJOHN OAKSHORN, builder and timber merchant, of Clapham.—A meeting of the creditors in this matter was held on Tuesday, the 14th inst., at the offices of the Official Receiver, 109, Victoria Street, Westminster.\nThe debtor is a builder and timber merchant, carrying on business at 111, Clapham Park Road, and\n\ncommenced about twenty-five years ago, and has kept books, which, however, fail to disclose his trading and financial position.\nHis statement shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £3,600, to fully secured creditors £2,219 6s. 1d., the securities held by them are valued at £4,060, making a surplus of £460.\nLiabilities on bills are £97 2s., which will have to be paid in full.\nThe total amount expected to rank for dividend is £2,456 0s. 7d.\nThe assets are: stock-in-trade £100, book debts £167 8s. 1d., furniture £10, other property, consisting of two horses and two vans, harness, &c., £40, and the surplus from the security in the hands of secured creditors £460, making in all £777 8s. 1d., and after payment of the preferential claims there is a balance of £97 2s., and creates a deficiency of £1,775 15s. 5d.\nThe deficiency by the general debtor accounts for this illness.\nIt appears the debtor was aware of his insolvency in 1881, and that the greater proportion of his present debts were incurred since that date.\nAt the meeting of creditors, Mr. H. Andrews, accountant, of Ironmonger Lane, was appointed trustee with a committee of inspection.\nThe following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nBall J., Victoria Park, Battersea ... ... ... 35 11 6\nBloore —, South Lambeth ... ... ... 10 0 0\nBone —, 150, Larkhall Rise ... ... ... 40 0 0\nBrown J.
