FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases whose names are published in these lists the creditors hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
WILLIAM CROOK.—The bankrupt was examined at length at the Salisbury Bankruptcy Court on Friday by the Official Receiver (Mr. F. Aston Dawes).
He stated that he started in business as a builder and contractor six years ago, and three years since estimated that he was worth £1,800.
In his statement of affairs it was shown that there was a surplus of £1,180, but the bankrupt now stated that he reckoned that amount on the supposition that his property would realize the same as he had sold, although, if a forced sale were made, he expected that great difficulty would be experienced in obtaining an offer for them.
He had communicated with the mortgagees, and they felt inclined to allow him to realise the properties.
He was one of the trustees under his father's will, but could not state whether he was indebted to the estate or not.
His brother was the acting executor, and he had never received an account, although he had written for it.
The Registrar was the acting solicitor in the matter.
Mr. Wilson said that the debtor had been applied to several times for the money, but he would never come near him.
After a lengthy examination, the bankrupt was allowed to pass upon the application of Mr. Fulton, solicitor.
JOHN OAKSHORN, builder and timber merchant, of Clapham.—A meeting of the creditors in this matter was held on Tuesday, the 14th inst., at the offices of the Official Receiver, 109, Victoria Street, Westminster.
The debtor is a builder and timber merchant, carrying on business at 111, Clapham Park Road, and

commenced about twenty-five years ago, and has kept books, which, however, fail to disclose his trading and financial position.
His statement shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £3,600, to fully secured creditors £2,219 6s. 1d., the securities held by them are valued at £4,060, making a surplus of £460.
Liabilities on bills are £97 2s., which will have to be paid in full.
The total amount expected to rank for dividend is £2,456 0s. 7d.
The assets are: stock-in-trade £100, book debts £167 8s. 1d., furniture £10, other property, consisting of two horses and two vans, harness, &c., £40, and the surplus from the security in the hands of secured creditors £460, making in all £777 8s. 1d., and after payment of the preferential claims there is a balance of £97 2s., and creates a deficiency of £1,775 15s. 5d.
The deficiency by the general debtor accounts for this illness.
It appears the debtor was aware of his insolvency in 1881, and that the greater proportion of his present debts were incurred since that date.
At the meeting of creditors, Mr. H. Andrews, accountant, of Ironmonger Lane, was appointed trustee with a committee of inspection.

ROBERT BISHOP, of Grove Road, Windsor, builder and contractor.—A receiving order was made in this matter on the 29th of March last, and the first meeting of the creditors was held on the 11th inst.
The debtor is a builder and contractor, and commenced business in the beginning of the year 1880 without capital.
In his statement of affairs he shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £2,022 2s.; to fully secured creditors £587, and estimates the securities as worth £630, making a surplus of £43; to creditors partly secured £1,380, and estimates their securities as worth £625, leaving a deficit of £755.
Preferential claims, payable in full, are £60 10s. 10d., making a total to rank for dividend £2,777; against which there are assets: book debts, £561; cash, £3; furniture, £18 18s.; surplus from secured creditors, £43; which, after deducting the preferential claims, leaves a net balance of assets £1,033 6s. 2d., and a deficiency of £1,738 15s. 10d.
At the time the receiving order was made the debtor had several contracts in hand, and Mr. James Herbert, high bailiff of the Windsor County Court, was appointed special manager under the supervision of the Official Receiver, for the purpose of proceeding with such contracts.
At the meeting held on the 11th inst. the debtor offered a composition of 5s. in the pound, payable 2s. 6d. in 14 days and 2s. 6d. within three months, secured to the satisfaction of the Official Receiver, which offer was accepted, and Mr. James Herbert was entrusted with the distribution thereof, as provided by the Bankruptcy Act, 1883.
