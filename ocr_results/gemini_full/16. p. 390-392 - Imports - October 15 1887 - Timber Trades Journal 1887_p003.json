Assets consist of stock-in-trade, cost £80, machinery, trade fixtures, fittings, &c., £200, furniture £100, these together are estimated to realise £226 3s. 6d., book debts, good £111 18s. 9d., doubtful and bad £95 15s. 8d., estimated to produce 10s., and surplus from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors £10, total £348 12s. 3d., from which £153 10s. 10d. has to be deducted for preferential claims payable in full, leaving net assets at £195 1s. 5d., and showing a deficiency of £1,666 4s. 9d.

Mr. Whatley appeared for the debtor, and Mr. Cottam Castle for creditors. The Official Receiver applied for an order that the debtor should furnish a deficiency account, and the Registrar concurring, the examination was adjourned till the 21st inst., the debtor to supply the account in the meantime.\nBROWNING, JAMES, builder, late of Thornton Heath, now of Kentish Town.—This matter, which has already been briefly reported in the Timber Trades Journal, has just come again before the Court. It may be remembered that the receiving order was made against the debtor on the petition of Mr. James Neal, of New Wandsworth, a builder and contractor, and a creditor for £148 8s. 6d., the amount of a judgment and costs in the High Court. The debtor was now examined by Mr. Shirtcliffe, the Deputy Official Receiver, of Westminster, S.W., after which Mr. Registrar Fox, who presided, again adjourned the examination.\nCLARKE, WM., builder, Bromley.—In this matter the public examination in bankruptcy having stood open since March, 1886, owing to certain proceedings in the High Courts, has just been closed. The debtor was\n\ndescribed in the petition as a builder, of Glebe Road, Bromley, and at the last sitting of the Court of Bankruptcy for his district the proceedings were completed and the debtor allowed to pass.\nCORDROY, THOS. HENRY, cabinet-maker, Old King Street, Bristol.—The sitting for the public examination of this debtor was held at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court recently before Mr. Registrar Harley. Mr. W. H. Brown appeared for debtor. The Official Receiver said that in the debtor's statement of affairs he showed liabilities £350, and assets estimated to be worth £70. In his deficiency account he had put down £250 as household and travelling expenses for a year. This was one of those cases in which probably no benefit would be derived from a more exhaustive inquiry, but it was exceedingly unsatisfactory. Mr. Brown considered that the debtor had done his best to supply a correct account, and the examination was adjourned till the 21st inst.\nDACOMBE, ALBERT, builder and cabinet maker, Wimborne.—At the Poole County Court his debtor applied for his order of discharge. His Honour observed that the Official Receiver's report stated that the debtor had failed to keep the necessary books of account, as required by the Act of Parliament, and that he had been trading after he knew he was an insolvent man. The debtor said he unfortunately had met with severe losses, and had a large family to keep. His Honour said he was bound, however, to carry out the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, which was a very wholesome piece of legislation, and it provided that a man in business should keep proper books of account, because it was right and proper his creditors, in case of insolvency, should know how his money had been spent. He should suspend the discharge for six months.\nEASTON, EDWARD, jun., joiner and builder, 26, Jackson's Row, Manchester.—The statement of affairs filed in this recent failure shows unsecured liabilities amounting to £383 3s. 2d. The following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nDutton James, Manchester ... ... ... 18 0 0\nGawin John, Manchester ... ... ... 46 0 0\nIllingworth & Ingham, Manchester ... ... 58 0 0\nLake A., Manchester ... ... ... 20 0 0\nLancashire and Yorkshire Discount Co.

A petition in bankruptcy had been presented against the debtor by Messrs. King & Starbuck, of Scarborough, timber merchants, and upon the application of Messrs. G. W. Webb his Honour made the receiving order. The assets were stated to be of trifling value, the amount of the liabilities did not transpire.\nFIRTH, JOSEPH & SONS, builders and contractors, Dewsbury.—The public examination of these debtors was held at the Dewsbury Bankruptcy Court. The statement of affairs showed liabilities £26,011 17s. 9d., and assets £4,059 14s. 2d. The Huddersfield Banking Company was represented by Mr. S. Chadwick, Mr. G. E. B. Blakeley acted on behalf of Messrs. Godfrey, Rhodes, & Evans, solicitors, Halifax, who likewise represented several other creditors, and Mr. C. A. Ridgway represented two large creditors. Mr. Blakeley asked the Official Receiver, who was asked by the Registrar to state his opinion on the matter, if he did not think he could complete his examination of the debtors until he had heard the examination on behalf of the creditors who were to be represented. The estate was of considerable magnitude, and the matter was in too early a stage for the examinations to be finally concluded. He should certainly ask the examinations to be adjourned until a day after the solicitors representing creditors had taken the examinations they required. It was finally agreed to set apart a special day for the examinations, namely, November 1st.\nGRIFFITHS, JOHN.—Last week this debtor, a builder, residing at 18, Spellow Lane, Liverpool, came before the Liverpool Court for public examination. The statement of affairs showed liabilities £740 8s. 7d., and no assets except an expected surplus from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors, amounting to £18 10s., and there are preferential claims to that amount. The debtor attributed his failure to depreciation of house property and consequent loss of rent. Eventually the examination was adjourned to November 7th.\n40\n\nOCTOBER 15, 1887.]\nand the debtor was ordered to make up his accounts.\nHAYTER, TOM BAKER.—A file further bankruptcy was ordered in Portsmouth County Court last week, by Mr. George Hall King, solicitor, of North Street, Portsea, on behalf of Tom Baker Hayter, builder's contractor, of Powerscourt Road, Buckland, and order might be granted against his estate, and on the same day the usual receiving order, constituting the Official Receiver (Mr. John C. Moberly, M.A.) receiver of the estate and effects of the debtor. For several months a private arrangement has been distributed to those creditors who would accept in payment of same. The debtor has been in business many years, and a few years since had one of the largest works in the town. The cause of filing the petition has not yet transpired. The examination is fixed for the 24th inst.\nHILLIER, WM., cabinet-maker, Marlborough.—The first meeting of creditors herein was held last week at the Official Receiver's offices, Swindon. The statement of affairs showed a deficiency of £211 0s. 5d. The causes of failure are alleged by debtor are bad trade and loss on sale of goods last year to the Marlborough Corporation. The debtor said his position was brought to its present issue by process issued by a writ. He was unable to make a proposal, and left himself in the hands of his creditors. Mr. Smith, a creditor, wished to know how the Marlborough Corporation became responsible to the office they appointed him. Mr. Smith said he was treasurer for the Corporation to the extent of £437. The debtor said that body, and had to collect money for them. When he resigned the office they appointed a new auditor (on all previous occasions his accounts had been audited, and found correct), who found that there were defalcations to the amount named. To do this the auditor had reopened previous years' accounts, which had once been audited, and found correct. He could not account for the loss, except that he might have used the money in his business. Mr. F. B. Smith, undertaker, of Great Portland Street, London, was appointed trustee, and the committee of inspection are:—Smith (London), Doyley and Pheasant (Marlborough), and White and Lucy (Marlborough). The sitting was adjourned sine die.\nHULETT, W. H., builder, Sandmere Road, Clapham.—The adjourned first meeting in this case has been held before Mr. Wreford. The matter had stood over in consequence of the non-attendance of a quorum of creditors, and the chairman stated that there was still no quorum present. The Official Receiver would therefore wind up the estate.\nKELLEY, WM., builder, Millbrook Road, Edmonton.—This debtor came up at the Edmonton Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday week before Mr. Registrar Pulley, for his public examination. In reply to Mr. T. W. J. Britten (Deputy Official Receiver), the debtor said he commenced business in 1872 or 1873 in Manchester, and failed, paying his creditors 2s. 6d. in the pound. He then worked as a journeyman until January, 1886, when he commenced building with a capital of £100 cash and a quantity of building material. Part of the cash he had saved, and part his father had given him. He did not become aware of his insolvency until December, 1886, when he ceased building. The only book he had kept was a cash book. His life was not insured. The immediate cause of failure was the verdict given against him and others in an action for illegal distraint. The first mortgages of the houses at Epping had sold, and the holder of a second charge had a second charge given by him. The debtor was allowed to pass his public examination.\nMILNER & HORNER, timber merchants, Meadow Lane, Leeds.—At a meeting of the creditors of the above-named debtors, held at the Law Institute, Albion Place, Leeds, on Tuesday, the 4th of October inst., a statement of affairs was produced, and read, which showed liabilities £1,085 12s. 3d., and allowing £136 for the payment of preferential claims. After some discussion, it was unanimously resolved that the debtors be requested to execute a deed of assignment of their estate and effects to a trustee for the benefit of their creditors, and that Mr. Matthew Lancaster, of Tadcaster, timber merchant, be appointed trustee, and Mr. William Pratt, of Rical, near York, and Mr. Thomas Pickard, of Horsforth, be a committee of inspection for the purpose of winding up of the estate. Creditors to the amount of £923 were present or represented at the meeting, and assented to the resolution.\nKING, CHARLES, builder, Sandgate.—The bankrupt appeared at the Tunbridge Wells Bankruptcy Court last week, and on behalf Mr. Hare, solicitor, said it was impossible to file an amended deficiency account, as ordered at the last sitting, until the previous day. In answer to the Deputy Official Receiver, the bankrupt admitted that some goods had been removed from his premises which he had not previously disclosed. The examination was therefore adjourned to enable further inquiries to be made.\nMATTHEWS, JOHN WILLIAM, builder, Folkestone.—In this East Kent bankruptcy the case the public examination was fixed to take place on the 7th inst., before Mr. Registrar Furley. The receiving order was originally made in the Canterbury Court, but the debtor was not now present, and Mr. Leman (the Official Receiver) said that he had heard that he had absconded. Under these circumstances the Registrar adjourned the case sine die.\nMORGAN, JOHN.—This debtor was described as a builder carrying on business at Grangetown, and came up for examination in the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court on Friday week. Mr. Stephens represented the debtor. The latter stated that when he commenced business, about 1883, he possessed about £300, left him by his father. His liabilities now amounted to £180, and the assets, represented by mortgaged property, would, if the full value were realised, amount to £153. Mr. Stephens pressed the debtor for an explanation why he sought to liquidate when he owed more than he owed. The liquidator said he was “no scholar,” but that on the other hand creditors was pressing him. Mr. Barnes said that Morgan was advised not to take this course, but he would insist on doing so. That morning it was discovered that the property was worth £50 more than at first thought. Replying to questions put by Mr. Stephens, Morgan said he owed a Mr. Slocombe, of Cardiff, £20. This man was a friend of his, and when he had some money he bought two houses belonging to Slocombe at something like £50 or £60 less than their value, deducted the £49 owing to him, and also a debt owing to the Lower Grange Brick Company, and handed back the balance, about £100, to debtor. At the time of this transaction Slocombe knew that notice of a writ had been served on Morgan by Messrs. Watson, and had been made acquainted with his affairs. For this £80 the debtor went around to his creditors and paid them at the rate of 10s. in the pound. The examination was adjourned to November 11th.\nMUSSELL, J. T.—This bankrupt appeared before the Registrar, Mr. R. G. Edmonds, at the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court yesterday, to pass his public examination, and in answer to the Official Receiver stated that he had been in business two years, previously to which he was a journeyman mason. For twelve months he carried on a jobbing business, and he then took a contract for the erection of a house in Woodford Park for £320. The contract proved an unprofitable one for him. His liabilities were £202, and assets £81. The Registrar said the debtor had really put £120 worth of his creditors' money into the house for the benefit of some one else. It was a lamentable case of a man going into trade utterly unfit for it. The Official Receiver said it was only typical of the great many cases in the building trade. The Registrar: It is the fault of the lawyers who back them up. (Laughter.) Debtor was allowed to pass. The following are the creditors :—\nBone J. J., 46, Duke Street, Devonport ... ... 20\nEde H. & Son, Sutton Road, Plymouth ... ... 52\nFord S., Fareham Place, Plymouth ... ... 10\nHarris & Penn, Steam Saw-mills, Plymouth ... 28\nHawken S., 11, Old Town Street, Plymouth ... 10\nPile H., 29, Tavistock Road, Devonport ... ... 20\nPritchard W. & J. W., Washford, Taunton ... 29\nOAKLEY, WILLIAM, builder and contractor, Tunbridge Wells.—At the Tunbridge Wells Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, Mr. Pochin, barrister, on behalf of the trustee, applied that the examination of the bankrupt might be adjourned to enable him to transfer it to another Court. An adjournment was accordingly granted to November 10th.\nRAYNHAM FREDERICK, builder, of Forest Hill.—On Wednesday last the official details were issued to the creditors in this matter. The liabilities and assets are as stated in the Journal last week. It now appears that the receiving order was made on the petition of Mr. Ernest Foreman, of 57, Gracechurch Street, E.C., acting as trustee of the estate and effects of Wm. Batchelor, a bankrupt. Mr. Cecil Mercer (the Official Receiver) in his report alludes to the debtor's books, and adds that he has only kept a day book of each job, and that no cash book or any of his receipts and payments have been kept.",
