Examined by the Official Receiver (Mr. F. A. Dawes), the debtor said he started business he had no capital and never kept any books. Part of the furniture in his house belonged to his mother-in-law, who resided with him. He had been aware of his insolvency for the last three years. The Registrar said that would discredit the debtor. Examination continued : He had incurred debts since discovering his insolvency. He had a thorough push during the last three years. The Official Receiver said it was unnecessary to proceed further with the examination, and the Registrar allowed it to be closed, but he told the bankrupt that he very much doubted whether he would get his order of discharge.\nDOTTERILL, HENRY, builder, of Canterbury Road, Croydon.-The motion, which was as reported in the Timber Trades Journal a fortnight ago-has just come up for hearing. Mr. Muir Mackenzie, on behalf of Mr. Cecil Mercer, of Victoria Street, Westminster, the Official Receiver for the district, that an order be made declaring \"that all the plant, building materials and other building effects, which at the commencement of the bankruptcy, were on the premises of the bankrupt in Canterbury Road, Croydon, were, and are the property of the trustee in the bankruptcy, as being in the possession, order, or disposition of the bankrupt at the commencement of his bankruptcy in his trade or business, with the consent of the true owner, under such circumstances that the bankrupt was the reputed owner thereof, and that Thomas Isaac White, who had claimed the said property, be ordered to deliver the same to the trustee and pay the costs of this application.\" Mr. A. Ditton, solicitor, appealed on behalf of Mr. T. I. White, who is also a builder in the Brighton Road. His Honour gave judgment for the Official Receiver, with costs.\nFOULKES, JOHN, timber merchant, Rhyl. -The adjourned public examination was proceeded with at the Bangor Bankruptcy Court on the 6th inst. The bankrupt was examined upon his deficiency account, and it was found that he had omitted several items amounting to several hundreds of pounds. He was allowed a further short adjournment to furnish the information, and eventually the examination was closed.\n\n[APRIL 16, 1887.]\ning liabilities amounting to £139 1s. 11d., assets £57 17s. 6d., or a deficiency of £81 4s. 5d. The Official Receiver said that the books which were estimated to produce £30 10s. were most unsatisfactory, as in the majority of cases he found that there were counter claims which exceeded the amount of the debts. The debtor attributed his failure to bad debts. The examination was closed on the understanding that the bankrupt should furnish a statement of his losses.\nGRAY, CHARLES, joiner, Wombwell, near Pontefract.-This debtor came up for his public examination on Thursday, the 7th inst., at the Wakefield Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar H. Mason. The statement of affairs showed a deficiency of £142 4s. 11d. In reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that, in September last, he endeavoured to effect an arrangement with his creditors, paying them 6s. 8d. in the pound, but while some were willing to agree to this composition, others refused, and it therefore fell through. At that time his liabilities exceeded his assets by £120. Ultimately the bankrupt was allowed to pass.\nHINKLEY, WILLIAM, builder, Chatham Road, Chatham.-The statement of affairs in this recent failure shows liabilities £544 10s. 5d., and net assets £285 8s. 3d., leaving a deficiency of £259 2s. 2d.-The following are creditors :-\n£ s. d.\nBarnes -, Chatham ... ... ... 6 10 0\nCooper & Son, timber merchants, London ... 85 0 0\nHowe -, London ... ... ... 14 0 0\nLinay J.

The Official Receiver's report was not of a very satisfactory description. His Honour said that he should suspend the discharge for three months, the offence charged against the debtor by the Official Receiver having been proved.\nLACY, JAMES ALOYSIUS, timber merchant, Canada Buildings, Canada Dock, Liverpool, and 30, Brook Road, Bootle (trading in co-partnership as James Cartmel & Co.).-The liabilities in this case are £693 6s. 5d., and assets £318 4s. 9d.

A., builder, Portland Place, Clapham Road, S.W.-The debtor has filed his petition, and on Thursday a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The amount of the liabilities and probable assets did not transpire.\nLANGDON, CHARLES.-This bankrupt was brought before the county magistrates at Truro, on Saturday, on the adjourned charges under the Bankruptcy Act, 1883. Mr. R. Marrack again prosecuted, Mr. R. Dobell defended. Mr. W. Bullen, ironmonger, Truro, was examined and deposed that last year, and in January of the present year, he supplied prisoner with goods to the value of £75 18s. 8d., £48 of which was delivered in December and January last. He had examined the boxes found in prisoner's possession, and there identified several of the goods he sold to Langdon. Cross-examined.-No arrangement for payment was made at that time. George Phillips, manager, confirmed this testimony. Prisoner's account up to last midsummer had been paid. Evidence was then called to prove the departure of the boxes from Truro and their delivery to the prisoner. They were consigned in the name of \"John Roberts.\" A valuer deposed that he estimated the goods found in prisoner's possession at £59 7s. Upon the completion of the case the prisoner was committed for trial, an application for bail being refused.\nMILLER, HENRY FRANK, of Beckenham, builder.-The public examination has been fixed for the Croydon Court on Friday the 29th ult. Preliminary details appeared in our last issue, showing the liabilities, assets, and deficiency.",
