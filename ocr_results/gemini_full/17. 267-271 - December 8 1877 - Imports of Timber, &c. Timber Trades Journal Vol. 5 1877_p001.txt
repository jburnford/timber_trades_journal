DECEMBER 8, 1877.

NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE.
(From our own Correspondent.) December 5th, 1877.
A large fleet of sailing vessels has arrived from the Baltic ports during the last week with timber cargoes, and, with the exception of a solitary cargo or two, these will now about complete the importation to the Tyne for the present season. The docks and wharves are very full, and all hands employed in stowing away cargoes. The importation has been very light, merchants having anticipated only a very small demand, and laid in stocks accordingly. All the saw-mills, as a rule, are working short time, and it is evident little or no alteration may be expected for some months to come.
Matters in the coal trade have a very gloomy prospect—the steam coal owners having demanded a reduction of 12½ per cent., and declined to submit it to the usual method of settlement by arbitration. Should the men decline to accept it, a lock-out will probably take place, and the result to trade generally in this district cannot but be most disastrous.

BRISTOL.
(From Messrs. G. M. Barnes & King's Circular, December 1st.)
We are pleased to report a considerable diminution in the import for the past month as compared with that of last year. There has been for this time of year a very fair demand, and the consumption has been such that it leads us to anticipate that the stocks will not be in excess of the demand for the ensuing spring season may be considered virtually closed, and as the importation for the advance. Quebec goods.—Yellow pine.—There have been several arrivals for railway purposes, but the demand for private consumption

is not great. Red pine is in rather better request; the same may be said of oak, elm, birch, and ash. Deals.—Fair demand throughout the month; inquiries for staves slack. New Brunswick goods.—There has been a very large importation during the season, but stocks do not appear to be too heavy. Prices are fairly maintained, and we anticipate an advance now that the shipping season is closed. Birch is not much in request. Baltic timber.—Memel.—Fir timber has not been in great demand, neither has oak. Swedish timber has only been imported to a very small extent, and the quantity now expected to arrive should meet with a fair demand. Baltic deals.—The importation has been considerable, but the demand has been steady throughout the season, and prices are firm. Prepared flooring.—Although the importation has been greatly in excess of an average of years, the demand has been such as to warrant the same, and prices continue firm. Pitch pine timber.—There has not been any large inquiry during the past month. Stocks will be ample until fresh arrivals. Mahogany, &c.—A cargo of Mexican has just arrived to our consignment, and will be sold by auction shortly, of which notice will be given. The arrivals for the past month (including 3 vessels, 2,404 tons register, that have discharged at Avonmouth Dock) consist of 6 vessels from Quebec, 4,914 tons; 5 from New Brunswick, 3,169 tons; 1 from Riga, 202 tons; 4 from Sweden and Norway, 2,009 tons; 2 from Archangel, &c., 788 tons; 1 from Finland, 347 tons,—together 19 vessels, 16,170 tons, for the corresponding month last year, showing a decrease of 4,743 tons register.
For the season commencing February 1st, 1877, to the present time, there have been 200 vessels, 109,097 tons register, arrived, against 210 vessels, 99,256 tons register, for the same period last year, showing an increase of 9,841 tons register.

CARDIFF.
(From Messrs. Adams and Wilson's Circular, 1st December, 1877.)
There has a decrease in the quantity of pitwood imported into Cardiff this month (Nov.) to the extent of 5,400 tons, as compared with the previous month (October); still the quantity received is far in excess of what is required for the collieries at their present rate of working; consequently, although the importers are offering the wood at prices which cannot but leave them a serious loss, they fail to find buyers for all which is imported, and are obliged to put the wood on the wharves, which will cause them a further serious loss before it is finally disposed of. Notwithstanding this, some large steamers have been fixed by French firms to bring forward immediately further considerable quantities. It is difficult to understand their reason for this action, but it is very easy to foresee the result.
There is no prospect of any improvement in trade, at any rate for the remainder of this year; and with the quantities of wood already in stock here and at the collieries there will be very little more required for some time. Annexed is a summary of the pitwood imported into Cardiff during November:—French wood, 8,826 tons; Irish wood, 1,673; English wood, 187; Spanish wood, 791; Swedish wood, 350. Total, 11,827 tons.

DUNDEE.
(From our own Correspondent.) December 5th, 1877.
The arrivals since I last reported have been pretty numerous, and a fleet has come to hand yesterday and the day previous not yet entered at Custom House, so that the harbour shows an unwontedly lively appearance just now. Trade is fair, but sales by auction are very poorly attended, and bidding spiritless.
