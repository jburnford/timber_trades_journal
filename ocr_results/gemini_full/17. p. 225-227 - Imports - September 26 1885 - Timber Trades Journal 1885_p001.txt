offered included a large and varied assortment of both American and European deals, battens, floorings, and sarking. There was a large attendance of buyers, both from town and country, and the auctioneer (Mr. Calder) having commenced promptly at the advertised hour, the bidding was somewhat spirited, and prices obtained were very fair for all except some old, inferior goods, which were cleared out without reserve. The sale lasted until late in the afternoon, and a large quantity disposed of was very satisfactory. Undernoted are particulars of the principal prices obtained :—

WOOD PAVING AT NORWICH.—The Wood Paving Committee of the Norwich Corpo-ration have accepted tenders for the supply of 300 loads of Memel deals.
EXTENSIVE SALE OF TIMBER.—At the saw-mills and other business premises at Ottery St. Mary, Devon, for many years occupied by the late Mr. John Digby, a large quantity of timber was offered for sale by public auction at an early hour on Wednesday.
We regret to announce the death of Mr. Joseph Thompson, of the firm of Messrs. Thompson & Co., which occurred at his residence, Gray Road, Sunderland, on Wednesday morning. The deceased gentleman was 64 years of age and has been ailing for some time past.
FATAL CRANE ACCIDENT.—An accident of a very serious character, which it is feared may result in the death of at least three persons, occurred on Wednesday evening at the saw-mills of Mr. [?], Wharf, Salmon's Lane, Lime-house. The premises in question belongs to Mr. John Lenanton, timber merchant, of [?] Wharf. Six men in the employ of the Britannia Dry Dock Company were engaged in the trees on an immense travelling crane. While so doing, the gearing of the traveller, to some extent under-going repairs, shifted, the effect of which was to cause the lifting gear to break. The immense baulks of timber at once fell on to the six unfortunate men. Assistance was quickly at hand, and the injured men were extricated from their frightful position, and conveyed in cabs to the London Hospital. It was found that four of the men (sawyers and labourers) in Mr. Lenanton's employ were injured, their injuries being so severely that it is feared their injuries may prove fatal.
