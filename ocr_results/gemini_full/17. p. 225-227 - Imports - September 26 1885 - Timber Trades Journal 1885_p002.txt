DESTRUCTION OF A SAW-MILL.
On Wednesday morning last a very extensive fire broke out on the premises of Excelsior Saw-mills, in Great Homer Street, Hackney. The whole of the total destruction of the building, which was promptly given, and in a very short time the brigade were on the spot with several a manual and steamer. The fire originated in mills the co-operation of the firemen was taken fairly under control. The building, which covered an area of about 100ft. by surrounded by a large quantity of timber, caused very great anxiety for its safety. A messenger was despatched to the Scotland Road for four additional engines, and on intelligence being received at the Southwark Bridge Road station, further aid was ordered on the spot from Clerkenwell and Islington, and the fire was confined to Hackney.
The fire was first discovered about half-past two o'clock, and at that time the first floor was well alight. Several manuals were promptly on the spot, and all round the building, and it was with such rapidity that in a short time the efforts of the firemen were successful. The shops of Mr. J. H. Ashton, a picture-frame facturer. A detachment of police were present to keep the fresh arrivals of engines, and severe exertion the fire was got under and extinguished. The roof had fallen in, than the roof of the building fell in, which this substantially-built erection, allowed the origin of the fire is unknown. its proportions, and the whole of the saw-mill itself was destroyed. The men kept at work with the engines till half-past two on Thursday, when all further danger had ceased. The building, mum. The building is the property of the London and Lancashire Insurance Company, and the damage done is estimated at £2,000. of the building was completely gutted, and a quantity of timber which was stored in the yard. Considerable damage was also done to the roof, premises, and a large portion of the contents of whose premises adjoin the mill. the Liverpool and London and Globe and Atlas offices, but it is not known whether the building was insured. The origin of the fire cannot be ascertained, but the watchman who himself looks upon it as a mystery, apparently safe a short time before the break was discovered.

PEART'S BLUE OR TIMBER MARKING INK.
We have had brought under our notice samples of a kind of chalk-like substance, much partaking of the character of French troduced by Mr. H. J. Peart, of 11, Road, E., for marking timber. We understand that this material, which is manufactured in two colours, red and blue, is very extensively adopted by the railway By its use a very distinct and indelible over other substances in use for the same that the rain will not wash it off. We are sure that our subscribers will find this composition of very great service in the yard for marking the contents of deals, boards and for other purposes.
