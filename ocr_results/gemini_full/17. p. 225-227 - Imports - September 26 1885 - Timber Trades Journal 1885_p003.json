Buckham, Town Hall, Ipswich, is borough surveyor.\n\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE AT HACKNEY.\nON Wednesday night a fire broke out on the extensive premises of Mr. F. J. West, the Excelsior Steam Saw-mills, Ash Grove, Mare Street, Hackney, resulting in the well-nigh total destruction of the works.\nA call was promptly given at the Hackney Station, and the brigade turned out expeditiously with a manual and a steamer.\nOn arrival at the mills the conflagration was found to have taken fairly hold of the building.\nThe works, which covered a large area, were completely surrounded by houses, a circumstance which caused very considerable apprehension.\nA messenger was despatched to the Commercial Road for four more steamers, and the intelligence being communicated to Southwark Bridge Road, the officer in charge ordered on the steamers from Tooley Street and Islington, and then himself proceeded to Hackney.\nWithin half an hour of the time of the first call seven steamers and four manuals were on the spot and well at work all round the building; but the fire spread with such rapidity that it outdistanced the efforts of the firemen, and ignited the workshop of Mr. J. R. Naish, boot and shoe manufacturer.\nA detachment of men were told off to keep the fresh outburst under, and after severe exertion they managed to control it, and extinguished it before anything further than the roof was burnt.\nThe diversion which this subsidiary fire had caused had allowed the original conflagration to increase its proportions, and by eleven o'clock the saw-mill itself was completely burnt out.\nThe men kept energetically at work till half-past twelve, by which time all further danger had been reduced to a minimum.\nThe building was insured with the London and Lancashire Insurance Company, and the damage done was the complete gutting of the building and the destruction of a quantity of timber which was stacked in the yard.\nConsiderable damage was also done to the roof, premises, and stock of Mr. Naish, the contents of whose premises were insured in the Liverpool and London and Globe and Atlas offices, but it is unknown whether the building was insured or otherwise.\nThe cause of the fire cannot be ascertained.\nMr. West, who himself locks up, having left the place apparently safe a short time before the outbreak was discovered.\n\nPEART'S BLUE OR RED FOR MARKING TIMBER.\nWE have had brought under our notice samples of a kind of chalk, or substance very much partaking of the nature of keel-ball, introduced by Mr. H. J. Peart, of 12, Lea Bridge Road, E., for marking timber.\nWe understand that this material, which is manufactured in two colours, red and blue, has been very extensively adopted in the timber trade.\nBy its use a very distinct mark can be made on the wood, and it has the great advantage over other substances in use for the purpose that the rain will not wash it off.\nWe feel sure that our subscribers will find Mr. Peart's composition of very great value in the timber yard for marking the contents on the face of boards and for other purposes.\n\n227\nREVIEW.\nTeknisk Tidskrift. Parts I., II., & III. of the third year of publication.\nThis is a magazine published by the Norwegian \"Engineers' and Architects' Union\" and the \"Polytechnical Union,\" both of Christiania, Norway.\nBeing printed in Norwegian (or Danish), the circulation of the magazine out of Scandinavia is probably a limited one, except perhaps, among those who have emigrated and found homes in other countries.\nThe magazine is wonderfully well got up, and is printed in Latin type instead of the antiquated Gothic or German type, which is now more and more rarely used in Norway, and in every respect it does its editor and printer great credit; among the articles in the before mentioned numbers we notice the following:-On streets, roadways, and traffic in some of the large European cities; roofing materials; making the River Raubera navigable; the speed of the newest transatlantic steamers; literature; the working expenses of Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish railways; rooting ovens; shipbuilding; observations on the height of the sea on the Coast of Norway; the bearing capacity of iron and steel; the new bridge at Queensferry, Scot.; the principles of the scales of charges on railways; correspondence from North America; the extention of the Rhine valley into Baden; the speed of vessels on Canals.\nFrom these subjects it will be seen that our friends in Norway keep themselves well posted as to what is going on in other countries, and with such a magazine as this to turn to for information and instruction, any student of engineering in Norway, will only have himself to thank if he does not get on in his career, as the opportunities offered by this publication are certainly very great.\n\nSIXPENNY TELEGRAPH RATE.\nON the 1st of October next the new rate for inland telegrams will come into force.\nThe charge will be 6d. for twelve words or less, and halfpenny per word afterwards.\nEvery word, including the addresses, will be charged for.\nIt is anticipated that in the majority of cases the senders of telegrams will need only to have their names telegraphed.\nThe new form is so arranged so that the address of the receiver comes at the head of the telegram in the space which has hitherto been occupied by the address of both sender and receiver, six lines being divided into five spaces each, being given for the division of the message and such information as to name and address as the sender thinks necessary to have telegraphed.\nA special place at the back of the form is devoted to the sender's address, where this is not to be telegraphed, as in such cases it will still be necessary for the department to have the sender's address in order to be able to communicate with the sender in the event of the telegram failing to be delivered, or any charge having to be recovered from him.\nIt also happens sometimes that persons require copies of telegrams they have sent, and in such a case, if the sender has failed to give his name and address, the department would not be able, without vexatious formula, to comply with the request.\nIn consequence of the change of rate the following alterations in the mode of counting will be made.\nNames of towns and villages will be counted as one word each.\nThus Malvern Wells, which, under the former rules, was counted as two words, will be only one.\nAgain, figures which were counted as one word each will be counted in Continental telegrams, at the rate of five figures to a word.\nThus 364, Oxford Street, under the former rules was counted as five words, it will be only three.\nInitial letters charged for as one word each, but an exemption has been made in favour of the London district initials.\nEach set of initials, \"S.W.,\" will be counted as one word only.\nThus the charge will be 6d. for a telegram of any length if the two addresses are within the same town.\nIf the two addresses are not in the same town the full rate will be charged.\nFor the purpose of this rule each London district is regarded as a separate town.\n\nTHE QUEBEC TIMBER MARKET.-The Quebec Chronicle of Friday September 11th, says: \"The timber market continues in a most stagnant state, and we hear of no fresh transactions.\nSome waney pine board of about 20 in. is said to have changed hands at 37½ cents.\nWe hear of nothing being reported in hardwoods at prices not transpired.\nDeals.-In pine deals we do not hear of any offering, while in spruce we hear that a lot has recently been sold at 43, 28, 23, and 17 dols. and if deals, with all charges.",
