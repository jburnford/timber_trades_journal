GLASGOW.
(From our own Correspondent.)
December 8th, 1875.
There has been a fair import of wood during last fortnight—for this season of the year—at the various Clyde ports and into Grangemouth; but the imports into Clyde ports over the whole year will show a large falling off when compared with 1874. Without taking into consideration pitch pine, of which there has also been a very small import this year, I expect the deficiency will amount to about 50,000 logs and 500,000 deals, as shown by the comparison of arrivals from Quebec, St. John, and other ports during 1874 and 1875.
The stocks for the spring months will not be large, and from all that can be gathered from American ports, prices are likely to advance, in-coming cargoes of deals being generally stored or stacked to sell at fixed rates.
A cargo of Santa Ana mahogany was sold here on Thursday, 2nd inst., by Messrs. Farnworth and Jardine. Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, and Co., agents—averaging 5 5/8d per foot.
A number of old remainder lots of Mexican mahogany were also disposed of—prices ranging from 3d. to 4½d. per foot.
The cargo of Santa Ana wood referred to in my last as having arrived is now all discharged, and comprises 375 logs. This is nearly all the mahogany now in importers' hands in Clyde ports.
No other public sales have been held here by brokers during the fortnight, but a fair business has been done privately. Current rates : Waney boardwood, 1s. 10d. to 2s. 1d. for 20 to 21-in. average; square boardwood, 2s. 5d. per 16-in. average; deck plank, 2s. 1½d. per 70 ft. average of prime quality, and about 1s. 9d. for F. A. quality, 50 to 60 ft. average; building timber, 1s. 5½d. to 1s. 7d., according to quality; oak, good, 2s. 5d. to 2s. 6d. per foot, and for second class, 2s. 1d. to 2s. 3d.; Quebec and Lower Port birch, 1s. 3½d. to 1s. 6½d. per foot.
Deals, Quebec pine, 1st quality, £22 to £23 0 St. Peters. stand.
„ „ 2nd „ £13 to £14 10 „
„ „ 3rd „ £9 to £10 0 „
Lower Port spruce, averaging 2nd qual. £7 15s. to £8 5s. „

LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.)
December 8th, 1875.
I have nothing new to communicate since my last. Thirty vessels have arrived with various wood cargoes, including a Quebec cargo for Granton. Messrs. Ferguson, Davidson, and Co. will sell by auction on the 16th (Thursday), in their yard, Albert-street, Leith Walk, a miscellaneous quantity of cut timber. Sale to commence half past twelve o'clock.
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville and Co. will expose for sale on the 21st, at Queen's Dock, twelve o'clock, Norwegian and Baltic deals and battens.
