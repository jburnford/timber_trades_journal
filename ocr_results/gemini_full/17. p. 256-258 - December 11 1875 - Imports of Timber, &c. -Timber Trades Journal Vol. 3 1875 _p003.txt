FRANCIS LEROY'S IMPROVED-PATENT
NON-CONDUCTING COMPOSITION FOR COATING BOILERS, STEAM PIPES, and other highly heated surfaces.
Much superior to Felt, or any other Composition, as regards Durability, Adhesiveness and Effectiveness, to prevent the radiation of Heat, save Fuel, increase the power of Steam, and keep the Stoke-hole and Engine-Room cool; it will at once show a leak; it cannot catch or communicate fire.
Used by H.M. Government in the Dockyards, the S.S. Great Eastern, a number of the S.S. Companies, and some of the greatest Engineers. Can be seen on highly heated surfaces, where it has been for ten years without the least apparent change. References and testimonials and all information, at F. LEROY & CO., Sole Manufacturers, 12 Gray Street, Philpot Street, Commercial Road, E., and Griffith Street, Manchester.
