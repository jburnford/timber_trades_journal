Mr. Upjohn: Was there not another item that Mr. Watson should pay your creditors £110? The Registrar here asked if that was reduced to writing, and being informed that it was the Registrar held that the debtor need not answer the question as the document would speak for itself, and ought to be put in.

After some further questions the public examination was adjourned until November.\n\nGODDARD, ARTHUR, of Sydenham, builder.—The public examination of the debtor in this matter took place at the Greenwich District Court of Bankruptcy, on Friday last.

HENRY, cabinet-maker, Marlborough.—The sitting for the public examination of this debtor was held at the Swindon Bankruptcy Court last week.

The Official Receiver said a dividend of 1½d. only had been paid, and the bankrupt having stated that he was not prepared to make any offer to his creditors, his Honour refused the application.",
