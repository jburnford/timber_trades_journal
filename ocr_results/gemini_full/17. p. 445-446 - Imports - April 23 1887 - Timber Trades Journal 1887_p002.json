West\nGAS-LIGHTING BY ELECTRICITY.\nThe Woodhouse and Rawson Electrical Supply Company of Great Britain, Limited, 11, Queen Victoria Street, E.C., which is always to the fore with improvements in electrical appliances, have now issued an illustrated descriptive pamphlet, a copy of which we have received, of their gas-lighting by electricity. This ingenious system enables all styles and kinds of gas-burners to be ignited and extinguished by means of an electric current. The method of working is as follows :-By the touch of a press-button, a current from the battery is sent through the coil of the magnet, which causes the armature carrying a lever end, rotates the circuit-breaker to vibrate. The armature, which has a pawl attached to it, having a ratchet-wheel connected to the spindle of the gas-cock to open the valve. When the ratchet-wheel is turned two-thirds and the gas ignited, the commutator shifts the current into another circuit, leaving the flexible wire dead. The act of a second button again makes the armature and forces the pawl to further rotate the ratchet-wheel one-third round, and shut off the gas. The commutator automatically cuts off the current when the lighting or extinguishing is accomplished. In large buildings and for purposes of street lighting, this system will be simply invaluable, and should come most extensively into use.\nLIMITED COMPANIES.\nThe following are the present quotations of the limited companies in the timber trade.

Last night (the 14th) 12 degs. was registered in Helsingfors. There is open water at many of the chief shipping ports (Abo, Rafso, Bjorneborg, and Helsingfors), and many rivers are expected to throw off their ice within the next few days. Generally speaking, there is remarkably less water in the rivers this spring than usual, and this will, no doubt cause some inconvenience to floating. The Neva is free. There are a few sailers at present for England at Sornas. Of course all the snow is now off the ground.\nREADINGS OF TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER IN THE BALTIC, &c., FOR THE WEEK ENDING APRIL 14th, 1887.\n[table]\n| | 8th. | 9th. | 10th. | 11th. | 12th. | 13th. | 14th. |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Stockholm | 35° half dull | 32° very fine | Easter Day; no information received | 42° very fine | 46° very fine | 38° windy, half dull | 30° fine |\n| Hernösand | 39° dull | 30° fine | 44° fine | 41° \" | 33° very fine | 30° very fine |\n| Haparanda | 32° windy, dull | 23° half fine | 39° very fine | 37° \" | 21° \" | 21° \" |\n| Uleaborg | 26° dull | 15° very fine | 35° \" | 35° dull | 25° \" | 19° \" |\n| Wasa | 32° \" | 26° \" | 37° \" | 37° very fine | 33° dull | 28° \" |\n| Helsingfors | 32° very fine | 33° windy, but fine | 39° \" | 32° \" | 34° \" | 37° very fine | 32° \" |\n| Wyborg | 32° very fine | 32° dull | 33° fine | 34° \" | 32° \" | 27° \" | 14° \" |\n| Petersburg | 32° \" | 30° snow | 34° dull | 39° \" | 39° \" | 42° \" | 14° half fine |\n| Riga | 27° dull | 35° dull | 39° very fine | 38° dull | 39° \" | 39° \" | 39° \" |\n| Archangel | | 19° foggy | 21° dull | | | | |\n\nAPRIL 23, 1887.]\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nBALDOCK, Wm., builder, of Hitchin.—On a former occasion this debtor's examination was adjourned to give him the opportunity of filing a further deficiency account showing what he had done with money received from a loan and advance company. On the next occasion he stated that he had not complied with the order of the Court, and the examination was again adjourned until this week. Mr. Ewen, Deputy Official Receiver, stated that on the previous Thursday had he received something from the debtor, and then he had sent him a statement of receipts, but said nothing about his disbursements. The debtor had now had forwarded a letter stating that it was impossible to furnish any further information. As the debtor seemed to have given them all the trouble he could, he (Mr. Cully) would ask that the examination be adjourned sine die, and this application Mr. Registrar granted.\nBROWN, J. H., builder, 82, Junction-road, N., and 84, King's Road, Camden Town, N.W.—The bankrupt, trading as J. H. Brown & Son, filed his petition in January last, and he applied on Wednesday for his order of discharge. The liabilities were £443 12s. 11d., and it appeared that the assets had realised £119 9s. 7d. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt commenced business in 1873 with £300 capital, and he attributed his difficulties to the falling off of his business, losses by bad debts, and depreciation in the value of his stock as estimated for realisation. His books did not sufficiently disclose his business actions and financial position. Mr. Registrar Giffard suspended the order of discharge for three months.\nCAREY, H. G.—A meeting of the creditors of Mr. H. G. Carey, builder and contractor, of Yeovil, Preston, and Hinton, was held on Wednesday. Mr. Keith Dowden (from the office of the Official Receiver) presided. The debtor's statement of affairs shows liabilities to unsecured creditors, £433 11s. 3d. ; creditors fully secured, £3,566 14s. 7d. ; estimated value of securities, £4,550 ; carrying a surplus to audit ; the assets of £983 5s. 5d. ; preferential creditors, £15 0s. 2d. ; assets : stock-in-trade, £70 ; good book debts, £74 7s. 4d. ; household furniture, £25 ; other property, £10 ; surplus from securities, £983 5s. 5d. ; total, £1,162 12s. 9d. ; deduct preferential creditors, £15 0s. 2d. ; leaving the net assets, £1,147 12s. 7d., which would give a surplus, after paying the creditors in full, of £714 1s. 4d. The debtor attributed his failure to inability to obtain payment of a debt due, amounting to £350, and to effect a sale of houses erected by him at Pen Mill, or to obtain a further advance on the same by way of mortgage ; also to the damage caused to his stock of bricks in consequence of the severe winter. The only observation made by the Official Receiver was to the effect that the debtor's affairs were wound up under a liquidation by arrangement eight years ago, but the amount of dividend then paid was not stated. Mr. Dowden pointed out that the most doubtful asset was the equity of redemption on the cottage property, &c., at Pen Mill, mortgaged to Mr. J. B. Paynter and others. If the property could be realised at anything like the sum estimated by the debtor, viz., £4,220, there would be no difficulty in paying 20s. to the pound, and a handsome surplus would remain besides. The debtor said that he could offer 12s. in the pound, to be paid in instalments, covering a period of two years. He had no responsible person, however, who would guarantee the composition. Mr. Dowden thought the creditors would agree with him that they could not accept any offer unless it was guaranteed. Eventually, it was decided to adjudicate the debtor a bankrupt, and Mr. T. J. Denman was appointed trustee. The committee of inspection consists of Messrs. C. J. Trask, S. Brooks, and W. W. Sawtell. The following are the creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nBaker W.
