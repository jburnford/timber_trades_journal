Messrs. W. Stewart and Co. on the 18th, at the Burgh Saw-mills, a varied assortment of wood goods, principally shown. There was a large attendance, much larger than usual, but this is to be accounted for as being the last sale for the season, and a dissolution of partnership taking place next month as advertised.

A large quantity of goods boards 5 x 1, 1s. 1d.; flooring, 1s. 2d.; sarking, 9½d. found buyers, but several lots were passed over in consequence of the time occupied in placing the various lots, darkness having set in before the sale was concluded.

CARDIFF.
(From Messrs. Tellefsen, Wills and Co.'s Circular, December 15th, 1877.)
The arrivals of pitwood during the last month have been in excess of the demand, and prices are consequently lower than they were. The extreme depression of the coal trade is no doubt the cause of the present glut in the market. We are of opinion that had collieries worked full time the quantity imported would not have been too large for the demand; but as it is, the price at this season of the year (when at least two shillings per ton Norwegian timber continues in below those of August and September. Norway just the same state as last month, only two cargoes having arrived this month.

DUNDEE.
(From our own Correspondent.)
In the way of business there is little of interest to report here. At the last meeting of the Works Committee of the Dundee Harbour Board, the engineer (Mr. Cunningham) reported that he had visited and inspected the timber ponds at Port-Glasgow, and also the yards for storing timber at Yorkhill, belonging to the Clyde trustees. He also submitted by him for the consideration the suggestions made in Dundee of modifications on the plans such as he had introduced in his plans, and these as amended were discussed. The committee agreed to recommend to the Board to approve of the plans for the construction of the ponds at an estimated cost of £2,800. To-morrow and day following the clearing sale of the machinery at the Dundee saw-mills takes place.
