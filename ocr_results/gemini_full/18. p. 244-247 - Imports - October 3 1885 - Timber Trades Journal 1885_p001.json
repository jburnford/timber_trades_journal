In the summer they are occupied in tilling the soil and tending their herds of goats on the hillsides, a pursuit they love so much that no amount of money could entice them from it.\n\nTHE WEIGHT OF AN AXE.\nI well remember my first axe, and my early experience with it. It weighed 4 1/2 lb., being the heaviest one I could find at the time. I was fresh from school—fresh from a class in natural philosophy, one of my favourite studies.\nI knew all about *inertia*, and had learned something of the force of gravity and the laws of falling bodies; had rightly guessed that chopping wood might be hard work, and determined that my knowledge of physics should help me out.\nI would have a heavy axe, a long handle—it would move slowly, and take strokes that would count when they fell. My axe handle was 34 inches in length, the longest one in the store. I had hired a tough little French Canadian, weighing about 120 lb., to help me at this work. When he came he brought an axe—a mere toy I called it. I think it weighed 2 1/2 lb., with a handle only 26 in. long. I told him I had a fair-sized job for him, and thought it would pay him to buy a full-grown axe. He smiled and said he guessed his would do. I tried to explain to him the beauties of a heavy axe and the wonderful advantage of a long handle. But it was all in vain: I was only wasting time; he could not understand it.\n“Poor fellow,” I thought, “he knows nothing of the beautiful science of physics. It is too bad that he should thus waste his strength through ignorance, and be unwilling to listen to the voice of wisdom.”\nWe went to the wood lot and began work. I had decided that we would work separately during the first day or two, in order that I might show him what I could do.\nAs I began to swing my axe I felt proud of its ponderous blows that rang through the woods, and rather pitied the poor fellow who was drumming away with his little axe, taking about two blows to my one.\nPresently I had to stop to rest, and then again, and still again; but Joe, my man, kept pecking away quietly, steadily, and easily.\nEvery few minutes I would stop to take breath; but Joe seemed perfectly able to do all necessary breathing without stopping his work for the purpose.\nWhen night came, we piled up our wood and measured it. Joe’s pile measured 1 1/2 cords; mine only 3/4 of a cord.\nDuring the early part of the day I had planned giving Joe another lesson in the evening, to see if I could not make him understand the elementary principles of wood-cutting and the philosophical requirements of an axe.\nBut when night came I decided that perhaps it would be as well to let him go on in ignorance, and thereafter remained silent on the subject.\nThe next day I felt lame, and stayed at home. Joe put his cord and a half as usual.\nWhen I went to the woods again, Joe and I worked together. Not many days passed before I found an excuse for buying a lighter axe and a shorter handle. And every axe and handle that I have bought since then has been lighter and shorter than its predecessor.\nWhenever I use an axe now I select one very much like Joe’s, both in weight and length of handle. I can use this without getting at all out of breath, and can hit twice in the same place. The result is, I can do more and better work, and save a vast amount of strength.\n\nRAILWAYS IN AMERICA.—The New York correspondent of an engineering journal states that the railway projectors of the United States are halting between two opinions upon the question of railway extension. About 12,000 miles of new road are in contemplation, but there is some doubt as to the expediency of beginning to construct them at once. On the one hand it is contended that the abundance of all kinds excepting wheat are favourable to immediate operations, as well as the moderate increase in the July earnings and the low prices of materials. On the other hand, the absence of marked improvement in the manufacturing industries is urged as a ground of caution. The writer adds that at present the American locomotive works are turning out fewer engines than for some years. The largest,—Baldwin’s, at Philadelphia—are employing only one-fourth of their average force, and this is not working more than three days per week.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nIMPORTS.\n[For the purpose of economizing space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
