THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON TRADE.
A statement, signed by a number of the leading manufacturers of Nottingham, has been published, protesting against the action of the Council of the local Chamber of Commerce in declining to reply to the questions issued by the Royal Commission on Trade Depression. The manufacturers affirm that in a matter so closely affecting the staple trades of the town the Council ought to have called a general meeting of all subscribers to and members of the Chamber of Commerce, and even to have invited other merchants and manufacturers connected with the Nottingham trade, and advised with them about this important question. They consider that the answer given was, in the face of the present severe depression in the local trades, eminently unsatisfactory, and that the whole matter ought to be reopened, and brought before a meeting more thoroughly representing the interests of the town. The answer referred to was to the effect that the Chamber believed the country was fully conversant with the causes of the depression of trade, and was of opinion that any interference with the principles of Free Trade would induce results disastrous to the commerce of the country.

WOOD CRYSTALS.—Chemical analysis has long since detected the presence of various mineral substances—potash, soda, silica, &c.—in many forms of vegetable growth, and the main source of potash at present, as of soda in former times, is the ashes of certain trees and plants. It also appears, as the result of microscopic investigation, that many of these mineral salts retain or assume a crystalline form even when embedded in the solid portion or bark of certain plants, as the microscope most unmistakably reveals. Should it be proved that the form these crystals assume is regulated or modified by the conditions and character of the growth which encloses them, it is evident that the fact would be one of great interest to science, and of peculiar value and service to the druggist, since it would enable him to determine the nature and purity of any medicinal bark or wood, by examining a crushed sample under the glass, and comparing the forms of the crystals with those represented in a series of standard plates. Thus the absence of the desired crystal enables him to determine the nature and extent of the impurity or adulteration.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ROGERS & HUBBARD.—This failure was reported last week. The first meeting of the creditors was held at the Bankruptcy Buildings, Portugal Street, London, W., under the presidency of Mr. A. Mackintosh, Official Receiver, who made some very strong comments on the conduct of the debtors in having traded after knowing themselves to be insolvent. The debtors had no offer to make, but it was decided to adjourn the meeting for a week.
J. J. MICHAEL, timber merchant, 27, Devonshire Chambers, Bishopsgate Street, E.C.—There was a sitting on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Pepys for public examination on this case, on the petition of the Assets Realization Company, the receiving order was made on August 7th, the unsecured debts amounting to £1,213 10s. 6d., and assets £905 1s. 2d., and according to the observations of the Official Receiver, the debtor in 1882 filed a petition in liquidation, his liabilities then being £11,042, and the assets £3,270. Under the present failure he attributed his position to bad debts, to loss on the realization of a property, and to depreciation in the value of the remainder. The case is one in which the Court has made an order for summary administration. In reply to Mr. Aldridge, the Official Solicitor, the debtor said he commenced business sixteen or seventeen years ago in partnership with another, the firm being dissolved in 1871. He believed that all the partnership liabilities had been cleared off. He first discovered that he was insolvent in February, 1885, and, although he continued to trade after that, he did not contract any fresh debts. The household furniture belonged to his wife, it having been sold by him to his father-in-law to pay a debt, and the furniture had since been vested in trustees for the absolute sale for £300, and the furniture had since been vested in trustees for the benefit of her and the children. With the exception of the 1882 failure, he had never failed before. The public examination was ordered to be concluded. The following are creditors:—

EDWARD WALLER, builder, Ranelagh Grove, Hanover Square.—This debtor attended on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Pepys to pass his public examination on accounts showing liabilities of £280 5s. 2d., and assets £7 18s. The Official Solicitor elicited from the debtor that he assigned his property to a trustee in 1879 to secure a composition of 1s. 6d. in the pound, and that he had not paid over by the person who received it, and that he had since been struggling on in the hope of being able to get clear. He had not since contracted many fresh liabilities, and had not taken contracts amounting to several hundreds of pounds. He was allowed to pass.
BEACH & HOWLETT, builders' merchants, &c., of the Great Northern Railway Yard, Caledonian Road, and elsewhere.—Mr. Registrar Pepys was on Tuesday asked to confirm the scheme of arrangement under this failure, by which the creditors accept a secured composition of 5s. in the pound. The Official Receiver reported that the total liabilities (admitted and to be admitted) were £7297, and that the composition would require £1,979, and the preferential
