There is very little question that the present hard frost will have a depressing influence on the price of timber here; it is certain to affect the consumption, and while it lasts a smaller portion of the large stocks at present stored in the docks will find its way into circulation. It is more than probable, judging from the three successive mild winters we have had, that there will be a good spell of hard weather this winter. The inquiry for deals and battens must consequently be slack, and we shall most likely commence the opening of the import season with, at any rate in London, a\n\n369\npretty well supplied market, a disadvantage which those foreign shippers who mainly depend upon the large consumption here will have to encounter.\nBut whether the winter be a hard one or not, the vast amount of work undertaken and in progress, and the immense area laid out for new buildings, both public and private, in town and in country, strengthens us in the opinion we have already expressed, that before the end of March next, trade in general, and the timber trade in particular, will experience a considerable rebound. The interruption to business which a severe winter may cause is almost certain to result in a stirring up of all our great industries with increased energy as soon as it is over, just as the lowest ebb tide is succeeded by the highest flood. It is quite a distinct thing from a natural decay of trade which sometimes befalls a country from a variety of causes, but perhaps there never was so much money in circulation in England before as there is now, nor so great a disposition to invest it directly or indirectly in private undertakings or public companies on a trading basis: therefore to believe in the continued depression of an indispensable commodity like timber in all its varieties, and respecting which we are forewarned of an approaching scarcity or greater dearness, almost weekly, by those who ought to know, and who furnish ample statistics in justification of their opinions, seems to us an absurdity. At present the stocks are heavy in London, and in the principal marts on our eastern coast; but even now we are advised that they are fast lessening, and the demand next year will, in all probability, be greater than ever it was before.\nThe stormy weather of the past three months, so destructive to shipping, has again drawn attention to the prevailing custom of deck-loads on timber-laden vessels, an argument which has afforded a subject of controversy for the last hundred years at least, and which has now assumed some prominence, as our readers will have noticed in our last impression.\nThere can be no doubt that at the fall of the year a quantity of valuable timber is lost by being stowed on ships' decks at a time when the probabilities are that they will have a stormy passage, and the vessel would have a better chance to combat with the storm that threatens to engulf her free of deckload; and nothing is more difficult than to give a decided opinion as to when a vessel may carry a deck-load and when she may not, that shall apply alike to the loading of all ships. There are no restrictions as to the proportions of length, breadth, and depth by which a builder should be governed in their construction, and consequently they are of the most varied character, and ships are built which for a cargo of timber would be absolutely less safe and manageable without a deck-load than with one, while there are others of a different construction that can carry their deck-load at greater risk; and possibly a portion of the fleet now employed in the timber trade are of the latter class. An old shipowner in the Canadian trade informed us that in his fleet he had two ships which illustrated both conditions. The one was obliged to carry ballast under her cargo, and would bear no deckload; the other, a broad shallow ship, was obliged to carry a considerable deck-load, or she was liable to lose spars and sails at sea by her great stiffness and disinclination to careen to the gale that blows, with a tendency to roll to windward in the trough of the sea, and if no deck cargo would generally reach her port of discharge minus her topgallant-masts if no worse damage happened. It is a pity that every season so much valuable property on which so much labour has been expended should of necessity be wasted in the manner we have described, but while we lament the fact we fail to perceive the remedy; and it is but fair to say that but few seamen object to go in a ship on account of her timber deck-load, possibly because it is always floatable, and should the ship strike it offers the readiest means of constructing a raft.\nIf the limits of a deck-load were prescribed by statute according to the capabilities or construction of the vessel, it would entail so much supervision that it would further discourage shipowning, which, if we are rightly informed, has already become a very risky business on account of the rigid surveyorships to which vessels may at any time be subjected, and of which the owner knows not the end. Lloyds and the Marine Insurance offices are a very good criterion as to the risk in respect of deck-loads to the general safety of the ship, and if it can be shown that more lives are sacrificed in ships so laden than in those free of deck cargo, we shall certainly be with those who advocate their discontinuance.",
