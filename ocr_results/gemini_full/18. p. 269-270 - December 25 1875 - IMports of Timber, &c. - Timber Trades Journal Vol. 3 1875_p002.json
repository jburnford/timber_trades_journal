The sudden cold snap caught a few of our dealers a little earlier than they expected, and some supplies did not get down the river, which were intended as a filling out on assortments. No one seems to be particularly short of stock, however, and though the general accumulation is estimated at a considerable per-centage below that of former years, the main difficulty anticipated is the search for buyers. On foreign account the demand fails to offer any greater encouragement than heretofore, as exporters hold no positive orders, and will not venture upon speculative shipments, owing to their recent unsatisfactory experiences. Stocks suited to this outlet are fair, and owners would like to see them reduced somewhat.\nQUEBEC.\n(From Mr. G. S.
