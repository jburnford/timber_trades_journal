NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," December 4th.)
With the closing of the canals, the check to navigation on the Hudson, and the reduced means of communication with points of supply on the Maine coast and in the provinces, there is now very little offering in a wholesale way, and the market is pretty well over for the season. The sudden cold snap caught a few of our dealers a little earlier than they expected, and some supplies did not get down the river, which were intended as a filling out on assortments. No one seems to be particularly short of stock, however, and though the general accumulation is estimated at a considerable per-centage below that of former years, the main difficulty anticipated is the search for buyers. On foreign account the demand fails to offer any greater encouragement than heretofore, as exporters hold no positive orders, and will not venture upon speculative shipments, owing to their recent unsatisfactory experiences. Stocks suited to this outlet are fair, and owners would like to see them reduced somewhat.

ALBANY.
(From the "Albany Argus," November 30th.)
Notwithstanding the intense cold weather for the past twenty-four hours the district this A.M. was busy in shipping lumber; the severe cold, however, retarded the movements of the shippers. There has been a fair business done since our last, and at full prices. The stock of pine lumber left at the close will not, it is estimated, if all in-
