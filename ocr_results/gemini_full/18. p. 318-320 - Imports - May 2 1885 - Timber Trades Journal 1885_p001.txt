CORRESPONDENCE.
THE SHIPMENT OF SLEEPERS AT MEMEL.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—In your number of the 25th inst. you give an extract from the report of Mr. Richter, late British Vice-consul here, bearing on this question. As one of the firms which, according to his authority, seem to carry things with a rather high hand, we ask you kindly to allow us to place before your readers the other side of the question.
We agree with Mr. Richter that according to the custom of this port the master of a vessel is required to take delivery of his cargo, and sign for it at the timber pond of the merchant from whom he loads. Mr. Richter, however, omits to mention that there is nothing to binder the vessel from being anchored a couple of hundred yards from the pond. For their own convenience, masters of steamers prefer to moor their vessels in the winter harbour or dock, and to transport the sleepers in rafts to the steamer. We think also, in fairness, Mr. Richter might have stated that the shipper pays half the expense of transport.
We also agree with Mr. Richter that a not inconsiderable loss of sleepers takes place in loading steamers, but entirely differ from him as to its cause, which is not to be found in the circumstances he states, but in the hurry with which all steamers are loaded. A master of a steamer loading 1,000 loads would consider himself unfairly treated if his ship were not loaded in three days, or even less. If in the transport a few sleepers get adrift no effort is made to recover them; but the chief loss arises in the winter harbour. In the anxiety to be quickly loaded, sufficient time is not given to sling the sleepers properly, consequently large quantities fall out of the slings; and should “sinkers” be among them they go down, not to reappear. In corroboration of this view we may mention that the quantity of sleepers lost in loading sailing vessels is trifling in the extreme in comparison with the loss in loading steamers. Of course there are among the masters of steamers careful men to whom these remarks do not apply, for these men rarely lose a sleeper.
Mr. Richter states that his efforts to procure a change have been fruitless. What these have been we do not know; but, although we are the oldest house in the sleeper trade here, he certainly never asked us to take any steps in the matter; had he done so we should have told him where the remedy lay, and probably his report would then have been different.—We remain your obedient servants,

COAL-DUST IN MORTAR.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—In your very useful Building News Supplement of the 18th inst., in answer to a correspondent, I meet with the following remark signed “R. C.”:—“Waterproof mortar may be made by adding coal-dust to ordinary mortar. Mortar thus made possesses great solidity.”
Sir, it strikes me that if this can be authenticated it is a piece of most important information, and I for one never heard of it before. If mortar can be made watertight, that is impermeable by rain or snow, by means of adding coal-dust to it, surely there need be no more damp houses, and weather slating can no longer be needed in exposed localities. A lot of coal-dust generally goes to waste in all our houses, so that nobody need make mortar without it. Ashes are known to be a stop-water, but unburned coal-dust as an ingredient for improving mortar must, I think, be a new discovery.
One thing only is wanting to make the information complete. Could not “R. C.” inform us what proportion of coal dust in comparison of lime would make the best mortar? I presume there is some needful limit to its use.
There are other considerations, too, which suggest themselves.

in mortar, and possibly some other of your building correspondents will tell us their experience of its utility, which I doubt not would be much esteemed by many others of your readers besides, Sir, your very humble servant,

OBITUARY.—We regret to record the death of Mr. Edward Martin, of the firm of Messrs. Martin, Wells, & Co., of Aldershot, on the 16th April, of bronchitis and pleurisy, aged 62.
We regret to announce the decease of Mr. Edward Chatfield, senior partner in the firm of Chatfield & Son, timber merchants, of Lewes and Cooksbridge, which sad event occurred very suddenly at his residence, Belvue House, St. Anne’s Crescent, Lewes, on Saturday morning last. The deceased gentleman was in his 71st year, the cause of death being apoplexy.
We also have to record the death of Mr. Charles T. Small, of Gloucester, aged 60 years, a gentleman well known in commercial circles, and particularly in Birmingham and its neighbourhood, where he had represented more or less for a period of thirty years first Messrs. Nicks & Co., then Messrs. Barkworth & Spaldin, and last of all Messrs. Thomas Adams & Co., timber merchants of this port. The Gloucestershire Chronicle says that socially the deceased was well connected. He received his education at Eton, and was a fag there to the Premier, and a day or two ago a letter was received from Mr. Gladstone expressive of sympathy for the widow in her bereavement. The late Mr. Small was of good address, could converse well, was quick in repartee, but never unkindly so, ever displaying the true instincts of a gentleman in having respect for the feelings of others, and his bonhomie was irresistible. He was thus a favourite with all who had the pleasure of his friendship and acquaintance. He was one of the original “Grenadiers” of the City Rifle Corps on its formation 26 years ago. Of those invited to the funeral there were present his brother-in-law, Mr. Henry Hyett, and Messrs. C. B. Walker, Albert Buchanan, A. Booth, and Henry Jeffs, besides gentlemen from the offices of Messrs. Adams & Co.

FIRE IN EDINBURGH.—On Sunday, April 26th, a fire broke out in a store on the premises of Messrs. Ferguson, Davidson, & Co., Imperial Saw-mills, Albert Street, Leith Walk. The Edinburgh fire brigade, on their arrival, found the store (whose contents consisted for the most part of wood) completely ablaze, while the flames had also spread to the boiler-house below, and to the engine-house adjoining. The exertions of the brigade prevented the fire from extending further, but the store itself was destroyed, and the boilers and engine were damaged by falling debris. The origin of the outbreak is not positively known, nor has the full extent of the damage been ascertained until the boilers and engine have been thoroughly examined. The loss must, however, amount to several hundred pounds. The reflection in the sky which the fire occasioned was visible for a considerable distance outside the city.
