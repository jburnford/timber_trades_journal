FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BEALE & KING.
This failure has been previously reported. The sitting for the public examination was held at the Poole Bankruptcy Court, on Wednesday, before Mr. W. H. Dickinson, Registrar. The bankrupts were subjected to a searching examination by Mr. A. S. Dawes (the Official Receiver), and stated that they commenced building operations at Southbourne-on Sea, in partnership, with a capital of about £10 each. They erected two nine-roomed villas, money being advanced to them from time to time, under an agreement, by a Mr. Harvey, who, however, when they had had £470, declined to grant them any more. As they could not get a mortgage until the buildings were completed, and creditors were pressing them, they failed, but they valued their property at considerably over their liabilities if it could only be realized. To complete the property would cost about £30, and they had hoped to have been able to get a mortgage upon it for £900, which would pay off Mr. Harvey, the only secured creditor, and the unsecured creditors, and leave them a surplus. The examination was adjourned for the production of the agreement with Mr. Harvey, the Registrar expressing his hope that in the meantime an arrangement would be come to with the secured creditor by which the debtors would be able to pay 20s. in the pound.

JOHN MORRIS.
This failure has been previously reported. The bankrupt appeared at the Brighton Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, for his adjourned public examination. The Official Receiver represented the Board of Trade, and Mr. Pope (of Stuckey, Son, & Pope) the trustee (Mr. F. G. Clark). The debtor was allowed to pass.

JOHN TUCKER.—At the Official Receiver's office, Plymouth, the statutory meeting of the creditors of John Tucker, coach proprietor and merchant, of Kingsbridge, was held, Mr. J. Greenway (the Official Receiver) presiding. Mr. J. E. Daws and Mr. Shelley represented a large number of creditors, of whom several were present, and Mr. Hurrell, solicitor, Kingsbridge, appeared for the debtor. The statement of affairs filed showed the gross liabilities £1,640 2s. 1d., of which £1,053 1s. 9d. is expected to rank for dividend. The assets consist of cash in hand £9 2s. 3d., book debts (good, doubtful, and bad) £516 16s. 3d., estimated to realize £46 11s. 6d., stock-in-trade £200, household furniture £200, bills of exchange or other negotiable securities £10 10s. 11d., total £1,083 10s. 1d. ; deduct £3,456 12s. 10d. for the amount due to preferential creditors for rent, rates, taxes, and wages £388 2s. 6d. The deficiency, £3,073 6s. 6d. The debtor attributes his failure to losses in trade, bad debts, depreciation of trade, and having his credit stopped at his bankers. After some discussion it was agreed to accept a composition of 5s. 9d. in the pound, payable one-half in two months, and the other half in four months, to be guaranteed by Messrs. Hurrell & Bar[?].

EDWARD RICKETTS.—This bankrupt came up for his adjourned public examination at the Poole Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, and was examined by Mr. A. Aston Dawes, the Official Receiver. The deficiency amounted to £1,151 8s. 1d. The bankrupt stated that he commenced business with a capital of £28 three years ago. He had been in the habit of taking building contracts, and he attributed his losses sustained on them and his insolvency to failure. He first discovered his position in January last, and endeavoured to come to a private arrangement with his creditors, but to no objection being raised, this he was unsuccessful. Now he was bankrupt was allowed to pass.

THOMAS REDFORD.—The first statutory meeting of the creditors of Thomas Redford, builder and contractor, of Horsham, Sussex, was held at the office of the Official Receiver (Mr. A. Mackintosh), 39, Bond Street, Brighton. The statement of affairs filed showed liabilities £815 7s. 6d. ; fully secured creditors £700; estimated value of securities £700; estimated surplus, £70. The assets consist of stock-in-trade estimated to produce £200; book debts, good, £41 18s. 2d.; bad, £41 18s. 2d.; household furniture £70; total, £392 16s. ; deduct amount due to creditors for rent, rates, and taxes, £70.

The first statutory meeting of the creditors was held on Tuesday at the offices of the Official Receiver, Bond Street, Brighton. Mr. Fowler, chief clerk, presiding. With respect to the estate, the chairman explained that the debtor said he had been in business ten years, and in 1881 alleged that he was worth £1,000. There was a question with reference to a previous partnership about which it might be necessary to question the debtor. He was formerly in partnership with a man named Peters, and when it was dissolved the debtor had £1,000. Subsequently he was also dissolved, and that partnership was also dissolved, the debtor paying him £100. The question was whether he was solvent when he paid that money. The chairman said the preferential claims amounted to £61, and when he dissolved the partnership with Peters he took the business, and paid him £1,000 to go out. Six or eight months afterwards he started a fresh business with Potter. When the debtor retired the debtor paid him out in £1,000, upon which there was a mortgage of the property, the debtor leaving him the book debts, stock, plant, and liabilities. A composition of 10s. in the pound was offered by the debtor, who said his brother-in-law would pay the money. Mr. Hudson, on behalf of a quarter of the creditors, thought the £250 should be refunded. In the end no resolution was moved.

PETER ALFRED [?]
A meeting for public examination was held before Mr. Registrar Pepys on Tuesday, under the failure of William [?], of Tennyson House, Walthamstow, builder and contractor, whose liabilities were stated at £1,479 10s., and debts fully secured £1,440, liabilities were £17s. 6d., and assets £1,440, consisting chiefly of a surplus from securities. At the meeting a composition of 6s. 8d. in the pound was accepted, payable in two and four months from the date of the confirmation of the arrangement by the Court, and to the satisfaction of Mr. Shorey, Mr. [?], and Mr. Davies, three of the principal creditors.
