THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. [OCTOBER 29, 1887.
ALLEGED FORGERY.—We understand that the defendant, Henry Wm. Muggridge, against whom the charge of obtaining timber by false pretences was dismissed, has been re-arrested on a fresh charge of forgery, and will be tried at Bow Street police-court.
* * *
SALISBURY.—The Mayor (Mr. F. Griffin) was on Wednesday evening last presented with a very handsome piece of silver plate, in recognition of his efforts in relation to the celebration of the Queen's Jubilee. To Miss Griffin (the Mayoress) was presented a chased gold bracelet set in two diamonds and a sapphire.

CASUALTY.—A Lloyd's telegram states that the Dei Gratia, from St. John, N.B., for Llanelly, was spoken on the 19th of October, in 52 N., 20 W., with loss of boats and bulwarks and short of provisions. The crew were starving, and were supplied with biscuits, flour, and sugar by the steamer Dominion now at Avonmouth.

DESTRUCTION OF TIMBER BY FIRE IN DUBLIN. —A fire broke out on Saturday evening, October 22nd, in the waggon and coach factory of Mr. J. Potter, of Fish Street, North Wall, in this city. It was discovered by an employe of the firm, who communicated with two fire brigades, but on their arrival the fire had spread almost over the entire building, and it was feared that the flames would extend to the adjoining premises of Messrs. Martin & Co., the extensive timber merchants. The building in which the fire originated was completely gutted. Over 100 tons of timber and about 80 coaches and cars were destroyed. The premises were nsured for £1,000. A large force of police kept back the crowd, who were attracted by the brilliant illumination. The origin of the fire is a mystery. The proprietor states that he examined the premises an hour before the fire broke out, and everything then appeared to be right. The hands had left work at three o'clock in the afternoon.

GUARDIANS AND THE SALE OF FIREWOOD.— When some Guardians of the poor seriously doubt whether firewood chopping can be made to pay no little encouragement ought to be derived from the Lambeth Union. At the last meeting of the Lambeth Guardians it was reported that a profit of no less than £285 18s. 8d. had been made on the sale of firewood during the past year. There is no doubt that firewood chopping could be made to pay, and pay handsomely, in every union were there no excessive railway rates in existence. The rates are exorbitant for most class of goods, and these press very severely on the English trader. In connection with the carriage in some parts for firewood, the Guardians will scarcely agree to try the doubtful experiment of seeing how much they can reduce the poor's rate by selling the wood. The cost not of the wood, but of the carriage, is prohibitive, and thus nothing is done, in this way at least to reduce the burthen local taxation.

MAHOGANY AND HARDWOOD TRADES.
MAHOGANY.—Though as yet there is no very perceptible alteration in the bulk of trade, a fairly good business is reported doing at rather advanced prices, and that things are improving is now freely admitted. The deliveries too, which have been pretty brisk of late, seem to indicate a steady absorption of stock, and these encouraging reports are not only heard in London, a like improvement being manifested all round. At Liverpool a cargo recently sold at public auction is said to have brought remarkably good prices. The only arrival this week is the Tell, from Minatitlan, having on board 610 logs mahogany and cedar and 79 log ends. There have been no public sales held during the week, but on Tuesday next, the 1st November, a sale is to be held, the catalogue of which contains 224 logs Tabasco mahogany, ex Hermes, from Santa Ana, described as of excellent quality, medium to large sizes, including a parcel of good curls; also 124 logs Tabasco mahogany, ex Oakdale, from Frontera, said to be of superior quality and large sizes, containing panel, machine, counter-top, table, and cabinet logs.
CEDAR.—The condition of things in this is substantially unaltered, but, should the

[OCTOBER 29, 1887.]
improvement, noticeable in mahogany, continue, it cannot be without a beneficial influence upon this market. We believe it evinces certain characteristics of holders of stock are being buoyed up in the hope that remunerative prices are not far before long.
AMERICAN BLACK WALNUT.—Inquiry has been an encouraging and business has been done in both number at satisfactory prices. There amount of stock in the docks only of the cheaper descriptions' deals are being inquired for, and not appear to be over-abundant
AMERICAN WHITEWOOD.—The this trade, though not essentially the whole has been rather not, however, hear of any large transactions having taken place. Prices remain about the same.
AMERICAN SATIN WALNUT.—There is at the present time a fair inquiry for this, from what we have not much confidence in its for by many it is looked upon as being a wood of very inferior character, and but for its cheapness would probably never have been at all extensively used in the manufacture of cabinet work. A rather large parcel of fresh-cut logs has just been landed at the East Wood Wharf, which seem to be a good lot.
KAWRIE PINE.—This wood is still very dull of sale, and we see but little prospect of improvement; the stock in the West India Docks is many remarkably large handsome logs, which, we understand, are to be bought of the brokers at unprecedentedly low prices.
SEQUOIA.—Sales in this are very difficult to effect; the demand is poor, trade being slow to an exceptional degree; the little speculation that has taken place has been confined to the very narrowest limits.
PADOUK.—Rather more has been done in this lately, and dock stocks are now much reduced; these comprise good useful logs and plank stuff of various thicknesses.
ROSEWOOD.—There has been rather more inquiry just lately, the actual consumption, however, is very limited, but as stocks are light, holders are enabled to maintain quotations with unabated firmness, though it is difficult to obtain any advance. In the other descriptions of cabinet-making woods there does not appear to be very much doing.
The only public auction sale to be held next week is that on Tuesday, by Messrs Thomas Edward & Sons.
LIVERPOOL.
The sales of Friday last, the 21st instant, held by Messrs. Edward Chaloner & Co., went off better than any of recent date. This may be accounted for in several ways. For a long time past the public auction have been few in number, and also comparatively unimportant, and the quality of the wood offered has not been sufficiently good to attract buyers.
But in this case the two cargoes which formed the basis of the catalogue were of fair to good quality, and as the market had been scantily supplied for some time past, there is no reason for surprise that competition was good and the prices showed a distinctive improvement.
The cargo of Tabasco mahogany per Sivah, from Minatitlan, very nearly 4½d. per foot, which is a distinctive advance over the prices which have been the general run of this market. The cargo per England was an indirect shipment, and being old, weathered and shaken, sold comparatively low; still we think it realised its full value at over 4d. per foot.
Several little lots of cedar were disposed of, and these too found buyers at better prices than heretofore. Messrs. Duncan, Ewing, & Co. offered several parcels of teak planks, one of which realised nearly £14 per load, but of the other parcel only one of the three lots were sold at from £15 to £17 per load.
