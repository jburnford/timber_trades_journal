468 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. [APRIL 30, 1887.

LEITH.
The arrivals of wood goods still lag behind those of last year at same date. During the past week there has not been a single complete cargo of wood, only a few oddments by some of the regular steamers, and, as your list of distribution of imports in last issue showed, the total importation to 31st March this year is only 3,749 loads against 6,686 loads last year. Nevertheless, there is no scarcity of wood goods in this market, the yarded stocks being still ample for all requirements. There is a good steady consumption going on, but the competition for orders is very keen, and the frequency of the public sales keeps prices down to the very lowest.
The public sale this week was held by Messrs. Ferguson, Davidson, & Co., at their Albert Street saw-mills, and the goods offered consisted chiefly of cut yellow pine, ash, mahogany, and wainscot boards, with the usual assortment of floorings, linings, &c. There was only a moderate attendance of buyers, and the broker (Mr. J. W. Hardie) experienced some difficulty in getting the necessary competition, the bidding being slow and buyers' requirements soon satisfied. The racks were not by any means cleared, and prices for the pine ruled low, say 1¼d. to 1½d. per sup. foot average, the average price being about 1⅜d. Of the other goods there was little sold, with the exception of the floorings and linings, which found buyers at the undernoted rates.
1¼ Whitewood flooring 10½d. per sup. yard.

TRADE ITEMS.
MR. WILLIAM GRIFFITHS has commenced business as a timber merchant at 982, Old Street, Shoreditch, London, E.C.

CANADIAN FREIGHTS.—The following charters from Canadian ports are reported in the Quebec Chronicle of April 14th:—To Liverpool—A Spanish steamship with deals from St. John, N.B., at 38s. 9d., and a British ship with do. from do. at 41s. 3d. To the west coast of England—A British bark with deals from West Bay at 42s. 6d., and another with do. from Musquash at 43s. 9d. To Limerick—A British bark with deals from St. John, N.B., reported at 42s. 6d.

THE OTTAWA OUTPUT.—From Ottawa reports says the Canada Lumberman (which, by the way, has been vastly improved by Mr. A. G. Mortimer, since he has taken it in hand), it is surmised there will be a full cut at least and if the winter had been a good one for lumbering many more logs than the mills could have cut up, which is limited, would have been made. This is accounted for by many square timber men having taken contracts for sawn logs instead of cutting square timber. If anything will be short next season it will be square timber, which is being cut in

WEATHER IN THE BALTIC.
The past week has been very dreary. I note that there has been some fine weather in the far north, but the temperature has, nevertheless, have everywhere been very cold indeed, and some very heavy changes we have had, so unusual to this climate, is said to have had an unfavourable influence upon them. I can chronicle another week or so. As a rule this port throws off its ice ten days to a fortnight later than the other south Finnish harbours. There does not seem to be many early arrivals of vessels or steamers as yet at any rate, and I learn that loading is not proceeding very quickly. I have no doubt, however, that things will be more brisk in a couple of weeks, probably sooner. The rivers are just at present throwing off their ice. There is, everywhere, a great complaint of exceptionally little water; this will, of course, be difficult to judge at present.

In the Bootle Times of Saturday last Turrett the contributor of 'Echoes' to that journal, devoted a portion of his space to the following paragraph:—“A little scene occurred at the Exchange Station on Thursday. I hear that was a fistic encounter between two Bootle gentlemen not altogether connected with the timber trade. The meeting was not pre-arranged, nor was the combat fought under the Marquis of Queensberry rules. In fact, it was of a rough-and-tumble nature, and a large crowd which had gathered was not altogether well pleased with the 'science' displayed, and to mark its sense of the eternal fitness' of things separated the combatants. These gentlemen then changed the venue to a second-class carriage, where hostilities commenced, and they carried on their muscular discussion until a railway porter, who probably is a member of the Peace Society, came to the rescue, and pulled the pugilists from the too-fond embrace which they were indulging in. Vive le boxe! You're another! Come on!”
