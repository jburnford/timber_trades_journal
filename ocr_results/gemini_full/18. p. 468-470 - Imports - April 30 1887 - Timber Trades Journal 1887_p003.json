[APRIL 30, 1887.\n\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases the creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nASTRUP, T., timber merchant, 58, Lombard Street, E.C.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Giffard, on Wednesday, upon an application by the bankrupt for his order of discharge. The receiving order was made in January last upon the petition of Messrs. Phipps, Turnbull & Co., of Melbourne, and the accounts filed by the bankrupt showed liabilities £10,045 1s. 9d., of which £3,821 6s. 2d. were unsecured; against assets £101 9s. 1d. the trustee (Mr. E. Foreman), certified on the 7th inst. that he had then realised £55 on account of the assets, and that he was unable to estimate how much further might be realised. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt formerly traded in partnership, on the dissolution of which he took over the assets and liabilities, and had since traded alone. The accounts showed a loss at January 1st, 1885, of £1,538 3s. 5d., and he attributed his failure mainly to a liability of £1,400 16s. 3d., under a judgment obtained against him in respect of a claim for loss on timber shipped in 1882, in his name, but, as he stated, without his knowledge. This judgment was given in April, 1886, and was subsequently confirmed on appeal. With respect to the transaction to which the bankrupt attributes his failure he stated that, in 1882, he drew bills for the accommodation of another firm to the amount of £4,000, believing that he would not be called upon to meet them. On the default of the acceptors (a firm in Australia) the bankrupt was held liable as aforesaid. The Official Receiver therefore submitted that the bankruptcy appeared to have resulted from the bankrupt having incurred a debt without reasonable or probable expectation of payment, as he did not appear to have anticipated that the same would be enforced against him. Mr. Tanner represented the Official Receiver, and Mr. H. Reed, who appeared for the bankrupt, said that the facts were not accurately stated in the Official Receiver's report. The bankrupt was agent to a firm in Sweden, and his failure was brought about in this way:—A person named Levi bought timber from him in 1882, and asked him to allow it to be shipped in his name to Phipps, Turnbull & Co., of Melbourne. The bankrupt consented, and at the end of three years, Phipps & Turnbull said there was a loss of £1,400 upon the shipment, and claimed the amount from the bankrupt. He contested the claim, being advised that he had a good defence, but ultimately judgment was recovered against him. There was no foundation for the allegation that the bankrupt had been a party to accommodation bills, for the bills had been duly met by Levi, and the question of the bankrupt's liability arose in consequence of his having consented to the timber being shipped in his name. The bankrupt having been examined in explanation of the transactions, Mr. Registrar Giffard decided that the case only called for a nominal suspension, upon the ground of the books not having been fully written up at the time, although they contained all the necessary materials, and suspended the discharge for three weeks.\n\nBAKER, A. B., builder, Ealing Green, W. —The receiving order in this case was made March 16th, and the accounts now filed by the debtor show unsecured liabilities £6,631 11d., and debts fully secured £56,111 1s. 8d., with assets nil. The following are scheduled as creditors:—\nFULLY SECURED.\n£ s. d.\nAlliance Bank ... ... ... ... 7337 0 0\nBaker J., Hammersmith ... ... ... 6300 0 0\nBowker & Co., Bedford Row ... ... ... 600 0 0\nBartlett —, Arthur Street West ... ... 2600 0 0\nCooke W., Camden Town .. ... ... 400 0 0\nEllis & Ellis, Spring Gardens ... ... 950 0 0\nFrost —, Hammersmith ... ... ... 18300 0 0\nHill & Co., care of Armstrong, Chalcery Lane ... ... ... ... 930 0 0\nLeach & Deedes, Lancaster Place, W.C. ... 2400 0 0\nPlerpoint R., 123, Pall Mall ... ... 4474 1 8\nThurpp & Co., Tanfield Court, Temple ... 3400 0 0\nThe debtor states that he commenced business as a builder in January, 1878, with a cash capital of about £3,000, that in November, 1879, he purchased the Cowley brickfield, Shepherd's Bush, for 5,000 guineas, a balance of £2,025 in respect of an advance obtained thereon now forming part of the unsecured liabilities, the brickfield being of no value; also that from 1884 to July, 1885, he worked the Mount Park brickfield, Ealing, which he had to surrender in consequence of an injunction. Further, that in February, 1886, at which time his affairs showed a large estimated surplus, he executed a deed of assignment, under which his creditors to the amount of about £4,500 granted him a release, and are, therefore, not included in present liabilities. He attributes his present failure mainly to his inability to sell or let, and depreciation in the value of his house and other properties, from which a surplus was anticipated at the time of the assignment. He has, on his own consent, been adjudged bankrupt.\n\nBAYLEY, WILLIAM FISHER, timber merchant, Great Bridge.—On Friday week, at the Dudley County Court, before Judge Sir Rupert Kettle, a motion in bankruptcy was moved, on the part of Mr. Shakespeare (instructed by Mr. E. M. Sharp, the official trustee; and Mr. A. Young (instructed by Mr. Alfred Caddick) was for Mr. Lavender, a creditor. Mr. Shakespeare moved, on the part of the trustee, that a transaction between the debtor and Mr. Lavender should be set on one side. His case was that within three months of Bayley's bankruptcy he allowed Mr. Lavender, a mineral merchant, to have £156 14s. worth of timber for a debt of £150, money lent on two occasions. Mr. Shakespeare quoted largely from the shorthand notes of the examination of Mr. Lavender to show that the latter was not a timber merchant, and argued that the transference to him of the goods was an undue preference. He had asked many times for his money, and finally upon which the timber was transferred. Mr. Shakespeare referred to several cases in support of his case. Mr. Young, on the other side, contended that it was not an undue preference, but that the only thing to be considered was what was passing in Mr. Bayley's mind, and so there was as no undue preference. His Honour stated that the cases be forwarded, and that he would go carefully through the evidence before giving a decision. A motion in the same bankruptcy affecting Mr. Devis, of Oldbury, was adjourned owing to the illness of that gentleman.\n\nBRAGG, HENRY, builder, Fulham, S.W. —The receiving order in this case was made in January last, and the bankrupt applied to the Court on Wednesday for his order of discharge. The unsecured debts were £2115, and debts fully secured £820, with assets £30. The Official Receiver reported that at the bankrupt account, and that he had not kept any books of account after knowing himself to be insolvent. Mr. Registrar Giffard suspended the order of discharge for twelve months.\n\nBREWERTON & HAMPSON, builders and joiners, Castleford.—This was an application for the debtors' discharge, at the Wakefield field County Court, before Judge Greenhow. Mr. Ottley, the Official Receiver, said that the only complaint that he could make was that they had offended against section 28, in that they had continued to trade after being aware that they were insolvent. His Honour suspended their discharge for two months.\n\nCOOKE, FREDERICK, builder, Great Yarmouth.—The public examination of this debtor been held at the Yarmouth Bankruptcy Court. In reply to questions the debtor stated that he commenced business at Nottingham in 1880, when filing his petition at that court he was made a bankrupt. A dividend of 8s. or 9s. in the pound was paid to the creditors. He then went into a situation at Bedford, and two years ago came to Yarmouth and began business without capital as a speculative builder; so that, if he was unsuccessful, he would have to bear the brunt of his loss. At the present time the whole of his stock-in-trade was worth only £8, and he had no furniture. What furniture he had under the other bankruptcy was bought in by his wife's sister and now belonged to her. His wife insured his life for £150 in the Prudential Society, she paying the premium.\n\nAPRIL 30, 1887.]\nthe premium. His household expenses had been about £2 10s. per week. The stock purchased from his creditors was used in the erection of houses. He had to get advances from time to time to pay his houses, but had not always paid the money into the bank. He had no means of telling what he did with the money received from the mortgagees. He might have paid his creditors in full had he been allowed time. The examination was adjourned until the 15th inst.\n\nCRAYMER, FREDERICK SEPTIMUS.—The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor, a coachbuilder, of 139, Victoria Street, and Soundwell, Bristol, was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Bank of England, Bristol, on Friday, before Mr. A. E. G. Way, Deputy Official Receiver. Mr. J. H. Clifton appeared for the debtor. The statement of affairs showed liabilities to unsecured creditors £311 4s. 4d., and assets: cash in hand, balance of proceeds of sale for rent £3 10s.; lord of stock, fittings, &c., £18 10s.; book debts £7 1s. 6d., total £27 12s., less preferential claims £7 1s., leaving net assets £20 11s.; deficiency £290 13s. 4d., which debtor, with a capital of £50, accounts for as follows:—Household expenses £150, law costs £10, payments on renewal of trade bills £10 5s., loss on exchange of a carriage and on building and selling a brougham £50, depreciation of stock-in-trade, fixtures, utensils, tools, &c., £50, and forced sale by landlord for rent £30. The Official Receiver's observations are:—\"The date of the receiving order the Sheriff was in possession under an execution, and there appearing to be insufficient on the premises to satisfy the landlord and expenses, the sale advertised was not interfered with. The debtor lives with his father in furnished lodgings, and there is no surplus after satisfying the landlord, and the book debts, amounting altogether (after paying preferential claims) to £20 11s., constitute the whole of the estate. The deficiency account is unsatisfactory and will have to be amended. The debtor having been adjudged bankrupt, the Official Receiver is trustee, so no resolutions are requisite. The following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nBirtles & Son, ironmongers, Upper Dean Street, Birmingham ... ... ... 10 0 0\nGrant R., iron merchant, Lawford Street, Bristol ... ... ... ... 8 0 0\nHewitt F., ironmonger, Frederick Street, Birmingham ... ... ... ... 10 0 0\nMacnan & Co., Glasgow ... ... ... 10 0 0\nMason & Co., varnish manufacturers, Derwent Street, Derby ... ... ... ... 17 0 0\nParsons, Thomas, oil and colourman, 45, Long Acre, London, W.C. ... ... ... 10 0 0\nReynolds & Son, builders' merchants, Tucker Street, Bristol ... ... ... ... 29 0 0\nRobbins & Draper, timber merchants, Cumberland Road, Bristol .. ... ... ... 20 0 0\nStone E.

B. Clayton. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £440, and assets £19 14s. 5d., which consisted solely of book debts. The debtor stated that he gave a bill of sale for £100, on the 26th October, 1886, to Mr. Huskisson. He attributed his failure to bad luck with his horses, having lost nine of them and a pony in two years. Ultimately the debtor was allowed to pass his examination.\n\nDAVIES, DANIEL, builder and contractor, Talley, Carmarthenshire.—A summary has just been issued in this failure by the Official Receiver, Mr. Thomas Carmarthen. The statement of affairs shows liabilities £788 4s. 3d., assets £152 15s. 6d., and a deficiency of £635 8s. 9d. The debtor attributes his failure to losses on contracts, want of capital, depression in trade, bad debts, and law-suits. The debtor commenced business at Talley, Carmarthenshire, about fifteen years ago, with a capital of £10. He has not kept proper books of account. He does not intend offering a composition, therefore the estate will forthwith be realised. The following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nArmitage & Co., London ... ... ... ... 13 8 4\nDavies & Jones, Llanyther ... ... ... 39 7 0\nDavies T. & W., Carmarthen ... ... ... 42 13 4\nDavies John, Llanwrda ... ... ... 30 0 0\nEvans R.
