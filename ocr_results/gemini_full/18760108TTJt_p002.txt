December 24th, 1875.
It would be difficult for those whose experience of winter is limited to the fitful climate of England to realize what that season implies in Lower Canada.
Let them imagine every roof covered with snow, roadways and pavements buried beneath a frozen carpet so dense that no wheeled vehicle can pass over it, a river where now large masses of ice floating up and down with the tide that presents, but one colour to the eye—and this not for a week or so, but for five or six months, and they will be able to form some idea of a Canadian winter.
No shipping, no outdoor labour, imperfect means of communication, and so far as the staple trade of the port is concerned the timber is ice-bound in the booms, and business in it completely suspended.
The outlook from a commercial point of view is dreary in the extreme, but in other respects life is very enjoyable here for those whose means permit them to turn their leisure to account.

Since the close of navigation the only intelligence of general interest to the trade is to be found in the annual statements of supply, export, and stock published by Messrs. J. B. Forsyth and Co., brokers of this city.
The care exercised by this firm during the last thirty years in compiling this annual trade record has acquired for it an unquestioned reputation for accuracy.
It would no doubt prove more satisfactory to English readers if the deals were classed according to quality, but a few firms here refused to return their stocks in that form, so that it was found impossible to supply the information.
It is, however, pretty generally admitted that the stock of first quality pine deals is under 15 per cent. of the quantity on hand.
The most serious feature in the report of 1875 is that it shows a falling off in the export trade not only in comparison with the preceding year, but with that of ten or twenty years ago; the difference would be even more marked had not the stagnation of trade been so great in the eastern lumber markets of the United States during the past two seasons.
The following table shows to what extent London has been dealing with this port during the last three years:—

MESSRS. FORSYTH AND CO.'S ANNUAL CIRCULAR.
We have again the pleasure of placing before the Trade our Annual Statement of Timber, Deals, &c., &c., together with the usual comparative statements of Supply, Export, and Stock wintering.
The past season has been one of unusual depression in every branch of commerce, and the Timber Trade of Canada forms no exception, for not only have our exports of timber to Great Britain fallen consider-ably under the average of past years, but the shipments of sawn lumber to the United States, which had attained to such a magnitude in 1871 and 1872, have in a great measure ceased, owing to the stagnation in business which has existed there for the past two years.
This sawn lumber is especially manufactured for the requirements of the United States.

As a proof of the falling off in the exports of timber to the home markets, we may here remark that in 1865, 27,610,960 feet of square and waney of all kinds were shipped from the Port of Quebec; in 1870, 21,445,880 feet, and in 1875, 14,933,120 feet, showing a great decrease in the space of ten years.
Nor has the export of deals increased during the same period as largely as might be supposed, for we find the quantity to have been 5,870,580 Quebec standard pcs. in 1865, 6,381,441 in 1870, and 6,334,182 in 1875.
Looking back again for twenty years, we find the largest shipment of timber to have been in 1863, when it amounted (as before stated) to 32,392,400 feet, and the minimum in 1875, when it only amounted to 14,933,120 feet.
During the same number of years deals (pine and spruce) reached their highest in 1874, and their lowest in 1856, when the statements show it to have been 3,242,963.
These figures will go far to prove that the export of square timber is on the decline; and we believe that the scarcity as well as high price of really good wood, and the enhanced cost of production, are among the chief causes of this decrease in the consumption of our Canadian woods, which cannot compete with pitch pine and Baltic timber as heretofore in Great Britain.
The manufacturers of all kinds of timber find it an impossibility to produce the same class of wood as they were able to do some years ago; the trees are more scattered, the new limits which furnish most of the choice timber more expensive to work, and in some cases almost inaccessible.
It is too soon to estimate the quantity of timber likely to come to market next season, though we have no fear of an over-production, for the low and unsatisfactory prices of hardwoods, waney board, and even choice white pine during the past year, as well as the action of many of the banks in curtailing their usual advances on timber, must bring about a great reduction in the supply.

WHITE PINE.—Waney Board.—The heavy production of 1872 and 1873, and the large stocks wintering since then, have had a depressing effect on this wood, and sales were effected with difficulty during the spring and summer months, but as an improvement has taken place, and the stock wintering is reduced to a moderate figure.
The supply of square has been under the average of the past ten years.
The spring opened with a dull market, the demand being chiefly for good and superior wood, very few rafts changing hands, as timber was procurable in shipping order at about the same prices as producers demanded in the raft measured off.
Prices became something easier in the beginning of September, and continued so up to the close of the season, most of the white pine having been sold, and a very small proportion of the stock wintering on manufacturers' account.
The local demand has been considerable, absorbing a larger quantity than usual of cull and inferior timber.
The quantity of square as well as waney to arrive viâ the St. Lawrence will fall far short of past years.
It is estimated that something over the average supply may be manufactured on the Ottawa, but so much depends on the height of water during the spring and summer months, that no calculation can be made of the supply from that quarter until the "drives" on its different tributaries are completed.
We hear also that the production of common and inferior wood is on the increase.
This is to be regretted, as we much fear there will be some difficulty in disposing of it, should it all reach market.
