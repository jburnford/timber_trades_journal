Sellers, to a certain extent, hold a controlling influence, and no retrograde movement on values can, under ordinary circumstances, be expected, but the power is by no means of such a nature as to admit of forcing a much higher range, and for the time being, at least, the tendency is a conservative one, looking to a preservation of all demand possible.\nSo far as it goes, the market for Eastern spruce may be considered a firm one, and quick enough to afford a sale for anything really desirable offering. There is, however, no regular supply, and even were there stock to be reached in any quantity or it would come forward, owing to the increased cost of transportation and the difficulty in securing vessels for the voyage at this season of the year. Manufacturers and their agents appear to be pretty well pleased with the close of the season, and the market is in a healthy condition apparently.\n\nTHE SAGINAW VALLEY.\n(From the \"Lumberman's Gazette,\" December 14th.)\nThe reports from many of the large distributing markets in the West agree in the opinion that by the opening of navigation next spring the yards there will be bare of stock, and this, taken in connection with\n\nthe fact that the manufacturing points from whence they draw their supplies will also be in the same short condition, would indicate that a larger than usual Western demand will be experienced here. The amount on hand here is probably less than it was a year ago, but still there is a large amount unsold on the docks.\nThe weather has been as mild as summer for the past few days, bright, clear, sunshiny, but pleasant as it is to most people, those engaged in logging are not satisfied with it, as colder weather and snow would be more to their taste. A much longer continuance of it will have the effect of curtailing operations in some parts of Michigan, but as there are many men here is more than equal to the demand, jobbers will be able to put on force enough at any time to get out their contracts, when roads, snow, and all other surroundings are favourable.\n\nCHICAGO.\n(From the \"North-western Lumberman,\" December 6th.)\nThe cargo market for 1877 is about closed, and the commission men can spend their time between now and next April admiring the credit side of their profit and loss accounts, and making advances to, and good contracts with, the saw-mill men, who depend upon them for the wherewithal to stock up for the next season's campaign. The receipts for sale afloat have been light during the past week, and a general firmness in price has been manifested. Dimension stuff of standard grades may be said to have closed at 7 dols. 75c. firm, and some sellers say that 8 dols. can be got for a few straggling cargoes to arrive. The last fleet of any account has been received, and we can bid farewell for four or five months to this market in a cargo way.\n\nTHE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.\n(From the \"North-western Lumberman,\" December 6th.)\nQuite a falling off in trade is noticed in western lumber markets, but still leaving a heavy demand upon very light stocks in the Mississippi valley. Dealers, as a rule, are satisfied with the operations of the year, and so sanguine of a continued trade that very few are making any serious effort to sell lumber, and none are disposed to shade prices, to any extent, to secure orders. In view of the prospective enormous cut of logs, it is probable that some of the holders of large stocks will become active in the new year. Undoubtedly the bulk of all the lumber on hand will be absorbed before another sawing season commences, leaving it a matter of choice whether to hold off until spring, or to actively drum up trade. The year just closing has demonstrated the wisdom of the lumbermen in making the preparations they have to do to an enormous business during the last few years. No more mills have been built—no more logs have been put on the Mississippi than the country along its banks, and westward, would have taken up, but for the two or three successive crop failures in a large part of the West; and this in spite of the unjust discrimination of the Chicago lines against the markets of the valley. This is proved by the fact that a single good crop relieved the yards of what many people (including ourselves) last year regarded as an enormous overstock. The grand lesson of the past year's experience is that the mills can saw more lumber than will be needed, with fair crops, next year. It may also be taken into account that the mills cannot saw now on the waters of the Mississippi what many people (including ourselves) last year regarded as an enormous overstock. The grand lesson of the past year's experience is that the mills can saw more lumber than will probably be more logs cut including the vast quantities hung up on the streams, and this fact will unfavourably affect their price.\n\nTHE DURABILITY OF IMPREGNATED SLEEPERS.\nThe following results were given at a meeting of engineers in Constanz, by Herr Funk:—\nRESULTS ON GERMAN RAILWAYS.\nMaterial of Sleepers.
