NAVIGATION OF THE BALTIC.—GEFLE, April 10.—Eggegrund Light was lit yesterday, the sea being open outside Lofgrun and Eggegrund. At Bonan the ice is very weak. Gefle River is open, and the channel in the ice extends to the outmost mooring posts. SANDHAMN, April 18.—The harbour is free of ice, and there is nothing to prevent vessels from coming in here. Open water extends for a mile inside from this place. ST. PETERSBURG, April 19.—The ice has begun to go adrift in the Neva to-day. CRONSTADT, April 21.—It is expected navigation will be open here in about twelve days. REVAL, April 15.—Steamers arriving here have to force their passage through the drift ice which covers the roads. RIGA, April 22.—The port of Bolderaa is now open for sailing vessels, and the navigation is already considerable.
ST. JOHN, N.B.—(*From Mr. J. L. Woodworth's Circular, March 29th.*)—Since the issue of our last circular some transactions have taken place in deal freights, which show a gradual decline in rates. This is not surprising to those kept familiar with the depressed state of the timber trade in Britain and the Continent, but the slightest indication of an improvement there would have a beneficial effect upon these freights. We hear of the following charters during the week:—
