BRISTOL.
Trade has been rather more active during the past month, although the sales have not been large, prices unfortunately continue to fall.
Now we have got through the long dull winter, we hope work may go on again, and that the anticipated improvement in business may not be checked by any misunderstanding in the labour market-a reduction of wages with the building operatives in this district being now about to come into force.
We are pleased to find the importation continues on a moderate scale, and it is to be hoped will continue so throughout the season.
Quebec goods.-Yellow and red pine timber are in but little request.
Oak.-Stocks small, demand dull.
Elm, ash, birch, and walnut.-Stocks only nominal.
Pine deals only in slow demand.
Staves and lathwood.-None.
New Brunswick stocks are reduced.
Staves are light in stock, demand heavy, and sales are being made at very low prices, but dealers do not care to speculate, the future being so uncertain and present consumption of such a limited character.
Fir timber.-There is only a small demand.
Prepared flooring.-Notwithstanding the large decrease in the importation, the consumption is so reduced that prices continue to go lower.
Spars and poles are scarce, and fresh arrivals of 4 to 6 inch will meet with ready sales.
St. Petersburg and White Sea goods continue in quiet demand.
for redwood deals.
White deals are scarce.
Lathwood.-Stocks sufficient.
United States goods.-Pitch pine timber has been imported moderately, sales are mostly of retail character, and prices continue low.
Black walnut is in fair demand.
Staves are light in stock, improved demand.
The arrivals for the past month consist of 3 vessels from New Brunswick, 1,865 tons; 2 from Memel, 746 tons; 1 from Norway, 310 tons; and 1 from the United States, 991 tons; together 7 vessels, 3,912 tons register, against 4 vessels, 1,936 tons register, for the corresponding month last year, showing an increase of 1,976 tons register.
For the season commencing February 1st, 1879, to the present time, there have been 14 vessels, 6,910 tons register, arrived, against 23 vessels, 10,536 tons register, for the same period last year, showing a decrease of 3,626 tons register.
