LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.) June 19th.
Arrivals of deals and battens here and in the Firth of Forth are very few, only four cargoes during the last fortnight.
No square timber has arrived.
Three cargoes of sleepers and 25 cargoes props; most of these props have been discharged at Bo'ness and South Alloa.
Below I note particulars of two public sales, one on the 10th and the other on the 17th.
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. will sell in their yard, Manderston Street, pitch pine, Baltic timber, deals, battens, &c.
Mr. James D. Thomson, at South Alloa, on the 28th, American and Baltic timber, deals, &c.
Messrs. William Thomson and Co., on the Sands here, on the 8th prox., square yellow pine, deals, battens, &c.
Messrs. William Thomson and Co. exposed for sale on the 10th, on the Sands, American and Baltic pine logs, deals, battens, flooring, lining, &c.
There had been no sale here for three weeks, and consequently there was a good attendance.
The sale was advertised for twelve o'clock, but it was one o'clock before the auctioneer got the company into working order.
The sale was opened with square yellow pine, and found buyers at prices which enabled the whole lot, or nearly so, to be disposed of.

Flooring, lining, and sarking were in good demand, and brought former prices, there being no advance.
Messrs. Risk and Co. offered for sale yesterday, at their yard, Leith Walk, American cut wood, waney and square logs, deals, battens, &c.
There was a very large attendance, and the prices throughout were very fair.
The cut wood was of very fine quality, and brought good prices, but was not sold according to average.
About 50 lots, being the entire quantity, were disposed of at prices varying from 1½d. to 3½d. ; 10 lots sawn pine deals, 1⅛d., 1½d. ; 90 logs square pine logs brought 1s. 3½d. to 1s. 7½d. per cubic foot, string measure ; 50 logs waney, small scantling, 1s. 8d. to 1s. 11½d. per cubic foot, string measure ; 30 logs waney, large scantling, 2s. 1½d. to 2s. 4d. per cubic foot, string measure ; 20 logs elm, 1s. 4½d. to 1s. 7½d., one large log, 1s. 9d. per cubic foot, string measure ; 8 ditto ash, 1s. 5½d., 1s. 5¾d. ; 16 logs birch, 1s. 3½d. to 1s. 6½d. ; one log, 1s. 10½d ; yellow pine deals, 3rd quality, 10½d. and 1s. per cubic foot ; Swedish deals, 11 x 4, 8½d., 8¾d. ; red and white battens, 6½ x 2½, mixed qualities, 1⅛d., 1¼d., 1d.
Flooring, lining, and sarking fetched the usual prices.
Several lots red and white deals, 9 x 3, 11 x 3 were late in bringing them forward, previous to stock-taking, so that several lots which are not enumerated were sold.
This was a clearing out sale.
No doubt a large space of ground was cleared out, thus making room for new arrivals.

A CIVIC CHAIR MADE OF OLD OAK.—Some time since an oak tree was found under the bed of the river Tone during excavations, and was presented by Alderman Taylor to the Taunton Corporation, who resolved to have it made into a civic chair.
The work was entrusted to Mr. Arthur Stevens, of the same town, who has just completed it.
The design is perpendicular Gothic in style, the front part of the chair resting on lions' feet, bearing massive canted and moulded pillars, on which stand carved lions supporting shields.
The sides are arched, and within them are richly-carved allegorical shields, representing Agriculture and Commerce on one side, and Science and Art on the other.
The back is also arched, and rests on columns with carved capitals supported by buttresses, the corporation seal being cut in the centre of the back.
The chair is upholstered in olive-green morocco.
