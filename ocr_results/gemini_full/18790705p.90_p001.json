[JULY 5, 1879.\nBRISTOL.\n(From Messrs. King Bros.' Monthly Circular, July 1st.)\nThere has been but a sluggish demand during the past month, and prices do not improve in the least. The stagnation may be partly accounted for by the strike in the local building trades, and also by the usual stoppage with the Whitsuntide holidays. Stocks generally are heavy, but several large sales have been made at the dealers' own prices, the importers being anxious to clear ground for new arrivals and to facilitate stock-taking. Quebec goods.—Pine timber is but in small request. Oak, elm, ash, birch, and walnut—Stocks light, demand only nominal. Pine deals are slow of sale. Stocks light. Staves and lathwood—none. New Brunswick goods.—Spruce deals are arriving freely, and with the present low prices the market is cleared, and there should be a fair demand for new arrivals. Memel, Danzic, &c., goods.—Fir timber continues in but little request. Wainscot oak—There has been a larger quantity than usual imported and prices are consequently very low. Staves are very quiet. Swedish and Norway goods.—Deals and battens—These goods are very slow of sale, and stocks are heavier than usual at this time of year; several lines have been cleared at very low rates, so as to make room for the new goods which will shortly arrive. Fir timber.—Stock and demand light. Prepared flooring has not been imported so freely as in previous years, but there being such a little demand the prices cannot be maintained. Spars and poles are scarce. St. Petersburg and White Sea goods.—Redwood deals are in quiet demand. White arrivals will shortly be here. Lathwood.—New United States goods.—Pitch pine timber—There has been a moderate demand in only slight request. Staves—Light in stock, fair demand. The arrivals for the past month consist of 3 vessels from New Brunswick, 1,336 tons; 2 from Memel, &c., 521 tons; 3 from Norway, 1,087 tons; and 1 from the United States, 521 tons; together 9 vessels, 3,541 tons register, against 6 vessels, 2,634 tons register, for the corresponding month last year, showing an increase of 907 tons register. For the season commencing February 1st, 1879, to the present time there have been 23 vessels, 10,450 tons register, against 29 vessels, 13,170 tons register, for the same period last year, showing a decrease of 2,719 tons register.\n\nTHE WOOD PAVING AT LAURISTON.—The secretary of Henson's Street Paving Company (Limited), the firm entrusted with the execution of the wood paving in Lauriston Street, has sent us a copy of a letter he had addressed to the Town Clerk in justification of the delay which has been complained of. This communication states that immediately upon ascertaining the probability of a failure in the supply of Crown Nyborg red deals for the work, the Company, in order to avoid needless delay, submitted an alternative suggestion to employ any other description of timber that might be approved by the town surveyor. In engaging to provide a specified brand of wood for the work, they say they were guided by local information as to the facilities for its prompt supply, but that it was only recently they had received the assurance of five or six of the principal timber merchants that the wood was not in the market. The Company, therefore, deprecate blame for a delay which, they submit, has arisen so unexpectedly; and, in face of the impossibility of selecting, cutting, and forwarding Nyborg blocks from London or elsewhere in less than four or five days more, they claim a corresponding extension of time. The secretary, in forwarding this letter, adds that, since it was written, the Company had received a communication from the surveyor, declining to entertain any proposition they had made in the hope of lessening the inconvenience.—Scotsman.\n\nA.
