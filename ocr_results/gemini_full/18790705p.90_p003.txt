American Intelligence.
NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," June 21st.)
The familiar "nothing new" is the very general reply to our requests for information among dealers.
Some report a pretty full business, others only fair, but very few appear to be at a standstill.
Indeed, the movement is at least holding its own up to the former average, and there appears to be reasonable hope for a continuation.
Prices, too, as a rule, are maintained, and appear to be fairly supported without much of an effort on all the leading styles, buyers making no serious effort to secure concessions in the ordinary run of operations.
There is not, however, the least indication of a basis for positive buoyancy, and the very generally expressed belief among the most reliable portion of the trade is that beyond small temporary fluctuations values cannot change much from the present level for this season.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," June 17th.)
A firmer feeling prevails in the market, and buyers are beginning to realize that the break they have been waiting for is not going to occur.
The dry lumber on the river is pretty much disposed of, and has brought fairly remunerative prices.
Enough lumber and other products of this region are going forward to keep all the vessels engaged in the trade fully employed, and lake freights are firm.
A number of buyers are on the river who have not shown up before this season, and from their talk and the tone of our eastern advices we judge that more active operations are anticipated for the fall trade.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," June 12th.)
The market has not been as largely represented at the Franklin Street Dock as the previous week, the number of arrivals being notably reduced.
The arrivals at the dock are followed by speedy departure, the cargoes being taken with average readiness.
As we go to press appearances indicate heavier arrivals, and city buyers are well represented among the cargoes.
The delay in unloading the big fleet of two weeks ago, from want of dock room, has been overcome, and the delayed fleet will no doubt return in full force before another issue of this paper.

THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman and Manufacturer," June 12th.)
The latest reports from the various river towns show a continuance of the demand for lumber as fast as it can be shipped with the limited number of cars to be had and the small, broken stocks to ship frome.
Prices seem to be unchanged, but evidently firmer, as the end of the supply of dry stuff draws near.
The supply of logs for all practicas purposes is secured now, and with a brisk demand and depleted stock of old lumber everybody ought to be in pretty good humour over the situation.
