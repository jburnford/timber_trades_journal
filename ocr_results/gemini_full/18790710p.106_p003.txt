American Intelligence.
NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," July 5th.)
Some showing of irregularity is made, but it appears to be principally upon goods dependent upon an "outside" demand. So far as the run of standard styles, sizes, and qualities adapted to local consumption is concerned the movement continues pretty free, and the market in the cheerful condition to which we have before alluded. The few recent gains made on value are very well sustained, with a promise of further addition in some cases, and the sales of desirable offerings are close up to the amount available, with an outlet for more. Naturally, business has been somewhat broken this week, but enough was done to indicate a good general status for the market. Export movements on the whole are fair, with recent advices from South America encouraging, but West India accounts somewhat doubtful.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," July 1st.)
No material change in the market has taken place. Prices are well maintained at previous quotations, and the demand is good. The stock of dry lumber is about disposed of, and is selling freely, although large orders are not numerous. No falling off in the demand or prices is anticipated, but rather an increase is expected during the remaining

months of the shipping season.
The shipments of the past week were 13,500,000 less than for the week previous, but the difference indicates nothing more than a peculiarity in the movements of the lumber fleet, more vessels coming in one week than another.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," June 26th.)
A limited supply and a still more limited demand have combined to make the wholesale market an exceedingly quiet place during the past week. The lumber sold has been placed only at the expense of considerable exertion on the part of sellers, neither the city dealers nor the few countrymen in attendance taking hold with any degree of animation. The demand, indeed, has been about the slowest and most unsatisfactory experienced this season, a fact which in itself is pretty good evidence that buyers do not propose to accumulate much more stock until the question of prices is definitely settled one way or another.

THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman and Manufacturer," June 26th.)
The demand for lumber continues large, especially for timber and heavy dimension, which the mills of the north-west are turning out as rapidly as they can reach the logs fit to make it of. The demand for this class of goods is unprecedented. There are no changes in prices at any western point, and but little if any cutting on current quotations.
