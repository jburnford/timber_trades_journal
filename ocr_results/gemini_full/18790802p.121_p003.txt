American Intelligence.
NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," July 19th.)
Our lumber market as a whole may still be reported as showing a promising tone, and on all desirable grades the selling interest holds rather the greater advantage. This is not sufficient to permit of exact-ing more than a good fair rate, but in many cases it does allow just this, and with buyers submitting to the extent of their known wants, without much, if any, contest, matters move along fairly, and all the principal descriptions of lumber find a steady distribution that business could be increased to a considerable extent, especially in the line of building grades, but the class of buyers and the security offering are not acceptable, especially to dealers who have had experience with former "improvers of real estate." Supplies from coastwise points have been somewhat irregular, but from the interior are more uniform, and there appear to be quite as many as at present wanted.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," July 15th.)
The market continues active, and the firme tone heretofore noted has culminated in a practical advance in prices for the better class of stocks.
The dry lumber on the river being about disposed of, the inquiry for green has increased, and with increased consumption at the east the result has been an advance of 25c. to 50c. on orders for future delivery.
Sales have also been made at $5, $10, and $25, although other particular sales might be reported. It is not likely that the better class of stocks can be bought any longer at the price last above mentioned.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," July 5th.)
This is the dullest week of the season, so far as the wholesale market is concerned. In fact fourth of July week is always considered so.
The receipts have been nearly 14,000,000 greater than during the same time last year, and cargoes have been rather slow of sale. There is no quotable change in prices, although the market is weak at the figures given. The total receipts of the season thus far are now over 100,000,000 in excess of last year, and it must be expected that such a showing will operate to depress the market.

THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman and Manufacturer," July 10th.)
The succession of storms which have deluged the north-west for ten days past, washing out railways and rendering common roads impassable, has naturally had a bad effect on the lumber trade, by retarding shipment, and at several important points suspending the operation of mills. Beyond this the gravest apprehensions are indulged concerning the crops. The reports show that in a few localities the grain has been badly used up, but the great bulk of the crop promises well up to this time. The streams of Minnesota and Wisconsin have been raised so much that driving crews have been sent for all the logs left behind, with a large probability of securing them very soon.
The latest news from the Chippewa is that rafting is progressing at Beef Slough at the rate of two and a half millions per day, with logs running in faster than they are taken out. Crews are at work on the Freams, and will soon have the logs all into the flowage of the Little falls dam. Logs are running freely at Eau Claire.

The Rum River drives on the upper Mississippi are all coming along finely, with the exception of two million feet on Tibbett's Brook.
This will clear the upper river of logs. All the logs on the main river, and off of the upper tributaries are in or near the boom limits. Turningr boom at St. Paul are light.
The St. Croix was visited by a fearful storm last week, which flooded the mills and suspended operations. No serious damage or loss occurred.
The log market is unchanged.

ACTION FOR INJURIES RECEIVED BY FALLING DOWN A SAW-PIT.
THE case of Fitzjohn v. Harris was tried at the Nottingham assizes on July 26th. Mr. Buszard said plaintiff was a joiner residing in Nottingham, and defendant a timber merchant carrying on business on Leen-side, Nottingham. Plaintiff was in the habit of getting timber from defendant, and on the 26th December, 1877, he wanted some wood to make a coffin, a kind of work which would brook no delay. He went to the defendant's place of business early in the morning, between six and half-past six, and when he arrived there he found the outer gate of the yard open, and expected to find there a man named Ashley, who was a carter in defendant's employ, and from whom he had bought wood before. Ashley was not there, but he found him at breakfast at a neighbouring inn. They went together to the timber yard, and found a suitable plank, and then proceeded together to the saw-shed to get a rule to measure the board, Ashley carrying a light. Here plaintiff fell down a pit beside a circular saw, and received injuries from which he had been laid up for seventeen weeks. The defence was that there was no evidence of any authority being given to the servant to invite plaintiff into the shed, there was no person on the premises to do business, and it was a general holiday, the shed was not the place where the wood would be kept, and there was no purpose connected with the contract by which it was at all necessary for the plaintiff to go into that shed. It was also proved that the defendant had been in the habit of entering the shed in the daylight, and must have known of the existence of the pit. The jury, after a patient hearing, found for the defendant.

CASSELL, PETTER, AND GALPIN'S PERIODICALS.—We have received the current numbers of Great Industries of Great Britain, Science for All, and Cassell's Natural History, all of which are fully up to the average. The Natural History, which must now be drawing towards the end, 33 parts having already been issued, is, as usual, beautifully illustrated, and contains interesting accounts of the habits of the various tribes of hawks, eagles, and vultures. The first part of a new edition of that important work, the History of Protestantism, by Dr. Wylie, is to hand, the text being illustrated with a large number of beautiful and appropriate engravings. The first book traces the history of the Christian Church from the first to the fourteenth centuries, noting the gradual development of the papal power, with a passing glance at the ancient faith of the Waldenses and the crusades against the Albigenses, and leaves us thoroughly interested in the subject at the time of the Protestants before Protestantism. We must not forget to mention that with part I. is presented a very fine engraving of Mr. E. M. Ward, R.A.'s, celebrated picture, "Luther's First Study of the Bible."
