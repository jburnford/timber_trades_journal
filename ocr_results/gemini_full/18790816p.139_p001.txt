AUGUST 16, 1879.]
NEARLY the entire parcels advertised were sold, and there appeared to be a better and livelier demand than has been experienced for some time back. Immediately after the above sale, the cargo ex *Orest* from Cronstadt was offered.
Petersburg white, 7 x 2 1/2, seconds, brought 1 1/2d. to 1 5/8d. per running foot
" " 7 x 2 1/2, first ends, 1 5/8d.
" " 7 x 3 " 1 7/8d.
But as this cargo was only being discharged, the sale was adjourned.
Messrs. Mitchell, Thomson, and Co. offered for sale on the 7th, at their saw mills and wood yard, Granton Harbour, the entire cargo of American timber ex *G. D. Cairns* from Quebec. This is the first sale of this season's importation, and the waney board pine is considered very fine.
There was a very large attendance, but still the quantity sold was less than might have been expected. The exposers did not appear particularly anxious to sell, and withdrew several lots. As usual, omnibuses ran direct from the west end of Edinburgh to Granton in connection with the sale, returning at the conclusion.
130 logs waney fetched 1s. 10 1/2d., 1s. 11 1/2d., 2s. 2 1/2d., 2s. 3 1/2d. per cub ft. stg.

BRISTOL.
(*From Messrs. King Bros.' Monthly Circular, Aug. 1.*)
IT is gratifying to note that with the very slow demand for all kinds of timber the arrivals of new goods keep moderate, and the import for this year is so far about 30 per cent. less than that in the previous year, whilst being 50 per cent. less than that in 1877. Such curtailment in the supply must eventually affect prices, which at present are

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
at a very low ebb, but it is pretty generally agreed that the lowest prices have been touched, and although no material rise has taken place, still things are firmer. Quebec goods.—Pine timber remains dull. Oak, elm, ash, birch, and walnut are in light request. Pine deals are a dull market, at low prices. Staves and lathwood—No demand. New Brunswick goods.—Spruce deals—The importation is about equal that of last year, stocks are moderate, and prices are without change, though apparently firmer. Birch—New parcels are now arriving, and we shall offer a cargo of fresh Pictou at our public auction on 27th August. Memel, Danzic, &c., goods.—Fir timber continues dull. Wainscot oak, owing to the heavy import prices, is very low. Staves are quiet. Swedish and Norway goods.—Deals and battens are slow of sale, and stocks are ample. Few cargoes of new goods have as yet come to hand. Fir timber—Stock and demand light, there being little demand shows a falling off in the importation, but prices do not improve. Spars and pole s—No import. St. Petersburg and White Sea goods.—Only one small cargo from Archangel has yet arrived. Good redwood deals are in fair demand. Whitewood deals are quite cleared, and new arrivals should have a ready sale. Lathwood—We are daily expecting a cargo of St. Petersburg woods, and it will be offered by auction on the 27th inst. United States goods.—Pitch pine timber—There has been a fair demand, especially for large dimension logs. Staves—Stocks sufficient, demand dull. Walnut is in light request.

HEIGHT OF THE OAK.—Mr. H. Dark wrote to the *Builder* :—A friend having told me that he has within the last twenty-five years seen an English oak tree, the trunk of which measured 100 feet long, and I, having great doubts of an English oak ever attaining such a height, will you kindly allow me to ask your numerous correspondents whether it has ever been known, and, if so, in what county the tree grew? Mr. F. Dashwood, in reply, states that he has had great experience in selecting and measuring oak trees, and is confident that an English oak has never attained the height of 100 feet in the trunk.
