CASUALTIES TO TIMBER-LADEN SHIPS.
DOVER, Aug. 18.—Pierre Frederic, brig, of Rouen, was picked up, derelict and waterlogged, 20 miles S.W. of North Hinder Light-vessel yesterday morning, and towed into Dover Roads this morning by steamer Ousel, of Cork, from Rotterdam for Liverpool. The brig will be docked at high water by harbour tug Palmerston.
ARCHANGEL, Aug. 20.—Norwegian brigs Nor, Guttormsen, and Pudsan, Pedersen, loaded with deals, have returned in a leaky state.
COPENHAGEN, Aug. 21.—According to a telegram of yesterday's date, from Bergen, the Camilla brigantine, of Holbeck, Jensen (firewood), has put back to the former port very leaky, and will have to discharge for repairs.—(This vessel cleared from Bergen Aug. 9—11 for England.)

FREIGHTS.
QUEBEC.—The Quebec Chronicle of August 14 reports that there has been no change in the condition of our freight market during the week. There is a little inquiry for tonnage, and rates remain steady at former quotations. Our ports are not getting bare of shipping, and open vessels are scarce, the full fleet not having commenced to arrive ; and as the latter will in all probability fall considerably short of average years, and grain freights show a firmer and upward tendency in Montreal, we think this will have a beneficial effect on rates here. We have heard of only one charter this week, viz., a ship for Liverpool, full cargo timber on private terms. Nothing has been done for London or Clyde.
PENSACOLA.—From Messrs. Hyer Bros.' circular dated July 31st we learn that the demand for tonnage continues, and quotations for United Kingdom and Continent are 37s. 6d. to 39s. for hewn timber, and £5 15s. to £6 for sawn timber. The receipts of hewn and sawn timber have been very small during the month, and the few transactions that have taken place have been at slightly improved figures. The clearances for the United Kingdom during the month are as follows :—Liverpool, War Spirit, 1,190 tons, 66,910 hewn, 9,250 sawn, 24,000 lumber ; London, Maria Sarah, 453 tons, 412,000 hewn, 949 tons, 31,340 sawn, 249,000 lumber ; London, Pauline David, 4,958 sawn, 344,000 lumber ; Montrose, Antioco Accame, 641 tons, 24,210 hewn, 141,000 lumber ; Bristol, Blackwall, 1,190 tons, 12,315 hewn, 58,275 sawn, 37,000 lumber ; Gloucester, Cagliari, 607 tons, sawn, 33,000 lumber ; Cardiff, Cambay, Turku, 465 tons, 25,950 sawn, 28,000 lumber.

(From the "Real Estate Record," Aug. 16th.)
So far as attractive grades of lumber are concerned there appears to be quite as free a movement as for some time noted, and a well-sustained encouraging market. Building account are consuming quite as much as anticipated, and the shipping calls from near by points occasionally afford an exhaust for very snug invoices. The export movement shows some irregularity, consequent upon difficulties experienced in securing desirable freight accommodation, but orders at hand are thought to be quite full, and dealers who make this portion of the business a specialty appear to be very well satisfied with the general outlook. As a very natural sequence of this condition of trade, the general line of prices is well supported, the moderate fluctuations occasionally taking place affording no basis for reduced quotations, though at the same time there is an absence of
