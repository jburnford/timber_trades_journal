NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," Aug. 30th.)
Our general market still retains a healthy undertone, and while some of the business of the past month has proven rather less satisfactory than hoped for, dealers are not, as a rule, inclined to grumble to any considerable extent. The principal difficulty appears to have been with some of the coastwise stuff, which, under favourable winds, &c., at times came to hand "all in a bunch," pretty much all the time and the wharf room of their specials, and randoms were in consequence under such neglect that receivers unwilling or unable to carry could only secure customers by making terms more attractive. Except under some such momentary influence as this, however, few concessions are made, and there are to be heard quite decided expressions over the prospects of the fall trade. Building operations, as planned, will be full, the general manufacturing interest is likely to prove a good source of consumption, and dependence is placed upon the export demand to afford an outlet of no considerable magnitude. Some of the wiseacres of the "commercial" journals have been for several weeks

off in the export trade. It was, as usual, somewhat lighter during August, but still averaged considerably over 1,000,000 feet per week, and shows an increase in total to date from January 1st of 9,000,000 feet over 1878, and 10,000,000 feet over 1877 of corresponding period.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," Aug. 21st.)
On the wholesale market the tendency is still upward, and business would be booming if there was any to do. But the number of cargoes offered at the wholesale docks so far this week would not make the fortune of the most modest commission man of them all. In fact, the dealers who get their living by the five per cent. process are beginning seriously to contemplate the decline and fall of the Chicago cargo market—the time when their occupation will have passed away.
From Monday morning to Thursday night not a dozen cargoes had been offered for sale afloat. Piece stuff has made a further advance, selling at $7.50, and at the date of this writing $7.75 is refused to-day expecting to get $8. Whether they will or not remains to be seen, but the chances are that they will. Lake freights have also advanced again slightly, and are still unsettled. The demand for vessels is large, and if it continues so, owners will be able to get almost their own prices.
