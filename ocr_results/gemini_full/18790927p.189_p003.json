so that, even with the best valuers, it is quite possible there may be a considerable discrepancy between their figures and the actual contents of the timber after it is felled and dressed out.\nBut perhaps the greatest inducement to sell timber standing is the pecuniary aspect of the affair.\nThose who have the management of such matters naturally wish to conduct the sale with the least possible outlay, and they find that by selling it standing they save all expense in connection with felling and drawing together.\nI said they saved all outlay for this is not strictly correct, for although they prevent any expense, but this is not strictly correct, for although they prevent any outlay for wages, the felling must in some way be paid for out of the timber, and the buyer has to calculate so much off for all such expenses, and in the circumstances must calculate on a liberal scale.\nHe has to pay more for felling than landowners, because he probably engages men only for a short time, and if they do not live in the neighbourhood where his timber is bought, the remuneration has to be proportionately greater.\nThese two points, viz., having power to let the timber remain growing if a suitable purchaser is not found, and the prevention of any present outlay for wages, are the only advantages that have presented themselves to my mind in favour of selling timber standing, as far as the interest of the landowner is concerned.\nNo doubt if the subject were considered from the timber merchant's point of view, there might be many more arguments adduced in its favour.\nIt has been said of the large timber tree that it is like the merchant whose worth no one knows until he is dead.\nI consider that a true remark, and one which forms a strong argument against this method of selling of timber.\nOne may value a tree at a high figure, believing it to be perfectly sound ; but when it has been felled and its faults laid bare, it may not be worth a tenth of what it was valued at.\nOn the other hand, one may see suspicious appearances in the tree, and make a liberal discount for deficiencies, but when cut down there may be comparatively little wrong with it.\nAltogether it is a good deal of a lottery how such trees may turn out, and it will be readily seen that purchasers in making an offer must have a good margin to work on against these risks.\nIn a portion of the agricultural press there has of late been a good deal said about the advantages of having a public weigh-bridge in fat stock markets, so that cattle may be weighed and sold at so much per stone of live weight, instead of the haphazard sort of method at present prevailing, when men of great experience may be deceived in an animal to the extent of several stones.\nIf such is the case with cattle—and there can be little doubt that a more exact way would be an advantage to the seller—it is equally true as regards timber.\nBring it, so to speak,\n\nDUNDEE.\nReichen—Riga—sawn timber and lthwd.—Order\nEmerald—Archangel—sawn fir—Order\nPatriot—Stettin—fir timber—Bell & Syme\nVespasian—Sarpsborg—battens—H.

The difficulty in many cases is to get them forward, and it requires exertion on the part of the forester before a sale to let it be well known, and to induce as many customers to come forward as possible where such matters are left entirely to auctioneers there will probably be disappointment.\nThis difficulty of course is most felt where selling the timber standing has formerly been the custom.\nI have several times seen wheelwrights and others in a small way attend the sales and never give a bid, but afterwards buy the same lots from the timber merchants at a considerable increase of price.\nTwelve months' credit I suppose was the inducement for such transactions, an inducement which even a liberal discount could not counterbalance.\nOn the other hand, where such sales are a regular institution year after year, they are looked forward to by tradesmen to supply their wants.\nOne of the best arguments in favour of cutting and classing the timber previously to selling it is the opposition it meets with from the large timber merchants.\nOnly recently a large timber merchant in Wales complained greatly to the writer about introducing sales of this description in the district where he formerly was the principal buyer in large standing lots.\nIn that case they have been carried on several years, and have been quite successful.\nIf the timber is of good quality timber merchants cannot afford to despise such sales, but are forced to buy to prevent others from taking the trade out of their hands.—*Journal of Forestry*.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 191\n\nGRANGEMOUTH.\nSept. 8 Julius—Cronstadt—batts., &c.—Robinson\nSleipner—Nyvik—battens—R.
