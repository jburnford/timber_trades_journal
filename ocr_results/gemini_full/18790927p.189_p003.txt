The Best Mode of Selling Home-grown Timber.

THE question of what is the best way to dispose of forest produce so as to obtain the full value is one which at a time like the present, when the great depression through which the country is passing, and which presses heavily on landowners, may be most appropriately considered in connection with the management of woods.
Selling timber standing is still carried out in many parts of the country, more particularly so in the midland and southern counties.
In Yorkshire and other northern counties there is a greater proportion felled previous to selling, and in Scotland felling before it is sold is the general practice, although occasionally, more especially in outlying districts, there are sales of standing timber.
There are certain advantages claimed for this method of selling timber which should be considered in comparing the different systems.
At a time when the demand for timber is very limited, as at present, if one has a quantity of timber to dispose of and offers it for sale before it is cut down, if the price tendered is less than he can accept, and the cutting of it down is not necessary for the welfare of other growing trees, he can let it remain till some future time when the demand is brisker.
One or two such cases have come under my notice this year.
Under such circumstances there is one point to be guarded against, and that is that the lot offered is not overvalued.
When timber is sold standing, a great deal of care requires to be taken in making a valuation, as there are many circumstances to be taken into account.
One of these is the liability of heavy timber to be shaken and split with the fall, whereby a great deterioration in value may occur.
Some varieties of trees are more liable to suffer from this cause than others.
One must in valuing make allowance for such casualties ; so that, even with the best valuers, it is quite possible there may be a considerable discrepancy between their figures and the actual contents of the timber after it is felled and dressed out.
But perhaps the greatest inducement to sell timber standing is the pecuniary aspect of the affair.
Those who have the management of such matters naturally wish to conduct the sale with the least possible outlay, and they find that by selling it standing they save all expense in connection with felling and drawing together.
I said they saved all outlay for this is not strictly correct, for although they prevent any expense, but this is not strictly correct, for although they prevent any outlay for wages, the felling must in some way be paid for out of the timber, and the buyer has to calculate so much off for all such expenses, and in the circumstances must calculate on a liberal scale.
He has to pay more for felling than landowners, because he probably engages men only for a short time, and if they do not live in the neighbourhood where his timber is bought, the remuneration has to be proportionately greater.
These two points, viz., having power to let the timber remain growing if a suitable purchaser is not found, and the prevention of any present outlay for wages, are the only advantages that have presented themselves to my mind in favour of selling timber standing, as far as the interest of the landowner is concerned.
No doubt if the subject were considered from the timber merchant's point of view, there might be many more arguments adduced in its favour.
It has been said of the large timber tree that it is like the merchant whose worth no one knows until he is dead.
I consider that a true remark, and one which forms a strong argument against this method of selling of timber.
One may value a tree at a high figure, believing it to be perfectly sound ; but when it has been felled and its faults laid bare, it may not be worth a tenth of what it was valued at.
On the other hand, one may see suspicious appearances in the tree, and make a liberal discount for deficiencies, but when cut down there may be comparatively little wrong with it.
Altogether it is a good deal of a lottery how such trees may turn out, and it will be readily seen that purchasers in making an offer must have a good margin to work on against these risks.
In a portion of the agricultural press there has of late been a good deal said about the advantages of having a public weigh-bridge in fat stock markets, so that cattle may be weighed and sold at so much per stone of live weight, instead of the haphazard sort of method at present prevailing, when men of great experience may be deceived in an animal to the extent of several stones.
If such is the case with cattle—and there can be little doubt that a more exact way would be an advantage to the seller—it is equally true as regards timber.
Bring it, so to speak,

on to the weigh-bridge, cut it down and measure it previous to selling, and then you know exactly what you are doing.
It seems altogether unaccountable how so many foresters and others having the management of timber sales should cling to the old method of selling it standing ; in the one case you estimate the contents, in the other you ascertain them exactly.
In most cases there is a ready market for felled timber, although in selling by auction one may sometimes fail to get market value for want of competition ; one must judge of the locality in which they are situated as to the best method of conducting the sale—whether by tender or auction.
Auction sales have come under my notice where the two buyers have ruled the sale at prices much below what was the actual value of the timber ; the quality was not good enough to command a good attendance of buyers, and when that cannot be done sale by tender is the more preferable method.
One great advantage of auction sales is the classing of the timber into lots to suit different purposes, and this is an advantage one has not in selling it standing.
Those who buy timber standing prefer to buy in large lots, and are generally what may be termed middle men, and have to sell again, to those engaged in different branches of trade, the various classes of timber suitable for their requirements.
Although these as well as other purchasers should be welcomed to the sale, I hold it is an advantage to the landowner to have his timber classed in lots (large or small as may be thought most advisable), and get the manufacturers and tradesmen to come forward and buy at first hand. The difficulty in many cases is to get them forward, and it requires exertion on the part of the forester before a sale to let it be well known, and to induce as many customers to come forward as possible where such matters are left entirely to auctioneers there will probably be disappointment.
This difficulty of course is most felt where selling the timber standing has formerly been the custom.
I have several times seen wheelwrights and others in a small way attend the sales and never give a bid, but afterwards buy the same lots from the timber merchants at a considerable increase of price.
Twelve months' credit I suppose was the inducement for such transactions, an inducement which even a liberal discount could not counterbalance.
On the other hand, where such sales are a regular institution year after year, they are looked forward to by tradesmen to supply their wants.
One of the best arguments in favour of cutting and classing the timber previously to selling it is the opposition it meets with from the large timber merchants.
Only recently a large timber merchant in Wales complained greatly to the writer about introducing sales of this description in the district where he formerly was the principal buyer in large standing lots.
In that case they have been carried on several years, and have been quite successful.
If the timber is of good quality timber merchants cannot afford to despise such sales, but are forced to buy to prevent others from taking the trade out of their hands.—*Journal of Forestry*.
