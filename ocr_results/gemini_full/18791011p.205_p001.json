King Bros.’ Monthly Circular, Oct. 1.)\nAlthough unable to report any upward movement in prices, importers are firm at late rates, feeling that they will be unable to replace goods for the same money.\nThe freight market continues to rise, and higher rates are being asked than the customary autumnal advance.\nThe importation for the past month has been heavier than that in the corresponding month last year, although not up to an average, owing to the bulk of the goods from the Baltic and White Sea having arrived together.\nQuebec goods.—Pine timber of good quality continues in demand, ordinary quality very dull.\nOak, elm, ash, birch, and walnut are in fair demand.\nPine deals are slow of sale, and stocks are ample.\nStaves and lathwood.—No demand.\nNew Brunswick goods.—Spruce deals.—Freights are again firmer, and stocks are moderate; prices well maintained.\nBirch—Rather more doing at late rates.\nMemel, Danzic, &c., goods.—Fir timber—Very dull.\nWainscot oak.—More inquiry.\nFir deals are in moderate request.\nSwedish and Norway goods.—Redwood deals and battens.—Prices are very low, Whitewood deals are with a good demand.—Prepared Flooring.—Very light in stock, selling at higher prices; stocks light.\nLathwood.—United States goods.—Pitch pine timber continues firm at late rate; stocks are sufficient, but fail to induce purchasers.\nStaves.—Stocks and demand moderate.\nMahogany, &c.—A small parcel of Jamaica wood sold at our last auction at, considering the wood, fair prices.\n\nWasa-Uleaborg-deals and battens-Order\nGozo (s)-Riga-lathwood-Order\nVenus-Tornea-deals, &c.-Neame & Co.\nSt. Jan-Tornea-deals and battens-Order\nAmanda-Onega-deals, &c.-Order\nAid-Tornea-deals, &c.-Neame & Co.\nNightingale-Memel-deals, &c.-Churchill\nF.
