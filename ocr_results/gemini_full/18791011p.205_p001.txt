OCTOBER 11, 1879.] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 205

LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.) Oct. 8th.
The importations during last fortnight consist of about 60 cargoes wood goods, viz., 13 cargoes deals and battens, 4 cargoes Baltic timber, 1 cargo Quebec timber, 8 cargoes oak staves, 12 cargoes sleepers, 4 cargoes props, fir staves, wainscot, treenails, firewood, &c., and various parcels lathwood, of which are appended.
There is only one sale to take notice of, particulars of which are appended.
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. have announced a sale of deals and battens on the quay, head of Queen's Dock, on the 14th, see advertisement.
Messrs. James Duncan and Co., in their yards, Seafield and Assembly Street, on the 28th, see advertisement.
Messrs. W. Thomson and Co., on the Sands, Leith, on the 21st, yellow pine timber now discharging ex "Adriatic" from Quebec.
A good many vessels from the various timber ports have been at sea for a considerable period, and should have arrived in the Firth long ere this; contrary winds, of course, have kept them back.
One large vessel from Quebec, viz., the "East," is daily expected.
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. offered for sale on the 30th ult., at the head of Queen's Dock, deals, battens, flooring, &c.
As there has been no public sale for several weeks, a good company assembled, but still there was a difficulty in getting buyers to come forward; however, the various parcels as advertised were placed at the following prices:—
per running foot
Red deals, Swedish 11x3 2 1/4d.
" " " short lengths 2d.
" " " 9x3 1 5/8d.

Flooring 6x1 1/4 11 1/2d. to 12 1/2d. per yard
A cargo Petersburg deals was expected to arrive in time for this sale, but contrary winds kept her back.
The importations being very limited and the stock low, another sale will not be likely to take place for two or three weeks.

BRISTOL.
(From Messrs. King Bros.’ Monthly Circular, Oct. 1.)
Although unable to report any upward movement in prices, importers are firm at late rates, feeling that they will be unable to replace goods for the same money.
The freight market continues to rise, and higher rates are being asked than the customary autumnal advance.
The importation for the past month has been heavier than that in the corresponding month last year, although not up to an average, owing to the bulk of the goods from the Baltic and White Sea having arrived together.
Quebec goods.—Pine timber of good quality continues in demand, ordinary quality very dull.
Oak, elm, ash, birch, and walnut are in fair demand.
Pine deals are slow of sale, and stocks are ample.
Staves and lathwood.—No demand.
New Brunswick goods.—Spruce deals.—Freights are again firmer, and stocks are moderate; prices well maintained.
Birch—Rather more doing at late rates.
Memel, Danzic, &c., goods.—Fir timber—Very dull.
Wainscot oak.—More inquiry.
Fir deals are in moderate request.
Swedish and Norway goods.—Redwood deals and battens.—Prices are very low, Whitewood deals are with a good demand.—Prepared Flooring.—Very light in stock, selling at higher prices; stocks light.
Lathwood.—United States goods.—Pitch pine timber continues firm at late rate; stocks are sufficient, but fail to induce purchasers.
Staves.—Stocks and demand moderate.
Mahogany, &c.—A small parcel of Jamaica wood sold at our last auction at, considering the wood, fair prices.

THE GLASGOW JOINERY TRADE.—As showing the unsatisfactory state of the wood-working trades in Glasgow, we may mention that whereas in October, 1876, there were 3,681 joiners working in Glasgow, the number had been reduced in September last year to from 1,800 to 1,900, and at the present time about 1,600 are working, and from 500 to 600 are unemployed.
A great number have emigrated, from fifty to eighty having gone to the Cape of Good Hope within the last four months, and many to New Zealand, which is a favourite colony for this class of workmen.
Not a few have also migrated to London and other parts of England.
