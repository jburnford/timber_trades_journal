From Ottawa accounts of very good business is said to continue to come to hand, and the promise of the cut of logs is said to be 50 per cent. greater than last year. Lumbermen are in good spirits, and hands are earning three to four dollars per month more than in 1878. Late cable advices from England report an advance in deals, which gives encouragement to the trade.\nQUEBEC.\n(From the \"Morning Chronicle,\" Sept. 25th.)\nIn our last weekly issue we gave a slight synopsis of the business of the season and our ideas and prospects for the fall trade. We can now state that in accordance with our articles, freights have considerably advanced, and as tonnage is now certainly going to be very far short of the demand for the few open vessels now here, much higher rates will be demanded for the few open vessels now here, and as they will not be numerous, we think they will obtain reasonable rates.\nWe may now quote :—Liverpool, 23s. timber, 60s. to 62s. 6d. deals. Bristol Channel, 22s. 6d. timber.\nST. JOHN, NEW BRUNSWICK.\n(From J. L. Woodworth's Circular, September 13th.)\nDeals.—Up the Bay, mills are in fair demand, with supply moderate, prices running from 5 dols. to 5.50 dols. City sawn are dull at 7 dols. Stock of city deals is light, but we hear of a large supply of logs at the different ponds, estimated by some at fifty million feet. We have to notice a continued firmness in deal freights, and what few vessels offering are taken at quotations. Coastwise business is fair, with rates steady. We hear of the following charters during the week.\nShip Eurydice, 1,280 deals, 56s. 6d.\n\nBretagne-Redon-70 lds.-Jones, Heard, & Co.\n3 Woizlava-Bordeaux-312 lds.-Stonehouse\nClementine-Bordeaux-123 lds.-Gueret\nDora Ahrens-Bordeaux-525 lds.-Order\nLord Houghton-Bordeaux-800 lds.-London and S.

All the desirable lumber that can be obtained is promptly taken, and all the lumber vessels find employment.\nCHICAGO.\n(From the \"North-Western Lumberman,\" Sept. 18th.)\nThe receipts for the past week have been the largest in the history of the trade in this city, aggregating 62,207,983 feet, an amount nearly double the receipts of the corresponding week of last year. The receipts of Sunday and Monday were the largest ever known for two consecutive days, being 24,317,000 feet. As a natural result of so large an influx of lumber, the yard docks have during the week been encumbered to such an extent with lumber that vessels have been somewhat detained at the Franklin Street rendezvous, where cargoes were seeking a purchaser. So ready has been the sale, however, that from an accumulation of over sixty cargoes at that point on Tuesday morning there were less than a half-dozen to be seen there on Thursday. Notwithstanding these immense receipts, the market has been well sustained. The feeling upon the cargo market is of a firm and buoyant character, and we hear in no instance of an opinion adverse to a full maintenance or even advance on present quotations. Freights have partaken of the general advance, and we revise our quotations to correspond with current charters.",
