220 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. [OCTOBER 25, 1879.

LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.) Oct. 21st.
Since my last communication most of the vessels from the various wood ports, which were making long passages, have now arrived, so that my return for last fortnight shows a considerable increase in the importations. 58 cargoes have arrived; these consist of 24 cargoes American timber, 5 cargoes Baltic timber, 16 cargoes pit props, 3 cargoes lathwood, &c.
I have noted below particulars of two timber sales.
Messrs. James Duncan and Co. will offer for sale on the 28th, in their yards, Seafield and Assembly Street, various wood goods, as per advertisement.
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. have announced a sale for the 4th prox., on quay, head of Queen's Dock, deals, battens, &c.
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. offered for sale on the 14th, at the head of Queen's Dock, deals, battens, flooring, &c. There was a good attendance of buyers from various districts, and a better demand might have been expected. Considering the limited stock on hand, and the advanced stage of the season, no doubt prices must be dearer. The whole of these goods were of first-class manufacture. The prices obtained were:—
Swedish white deals 11 x 3 2½d. per running foot
" " 9 x 3 2d. "
" battens 7 x 2½ 1¾d. to 1⅞d. "
" " 6 x 2½ 1d. "
Petersburg white crown 11 x 3 2½d. "
White flooring 1¼ x 6½ 11d. per yard "
" sarking 9 x ⅝ 6½d. Lining, 6½d. "
Messrs. Wm. Thomson and Co. exposed for sale on the 21st, at the Albert Dock, the entire cargo ex "Adriatic," from Quebec, consisting of yellow pine logs, hardwood, deals, &c. There was a large attendance of the trade generally. Several good parcels waney and square pine found buyers; the elm (3,000

feet), were all disposed of. Oak did not appear so much in demand although several lots were sold. St. Petersburg deals and Wybor battens advertised for sale did not arrive in time. Prices as follow, viz.:—
Waney pine 1s. 11½d. to 2s. 2½d. per cubic foot, string measure
Square " 1s. 6d. to 1s. 8½d. "
" " short lengths and small scantlings, 1s. 3d. to 1s. 4d.
Oak, 2s. 3½d., 2s. 7d., 2s. 8d.
Ash, 1s. 8½d., 1s. 10½d., 1s. 11d.
Birch, 1s. 7d., 1s. 8d., 1s. 8½d.
Yellow pine deals, third quality, 1s. 9d., 1s. 10d.
" " " ends, first quality, 1s., 1s. 0½d. per cubic foot.
Archangel deals, 11 x 3 2½d.
" " 7 x 2½ 1¾d.

CARDIFF.—Messrs. Tellefsen, Wills, and Co., in their circular dated the 15th October, report no change in the pitwood market; there has been a fair arrival of wood this month, and prices remain unchanged. It does not appear to be at all probable that we shall reach in November and December, this year, the high prices that ruled in those months in 1878. A few cargoes of Norwegian mining timber arrived during the month; the demand was very small, and there has been little or no increase to the stocks in port. Prices have an upward tendency rather than otherwise.

BOXWOOD IN RUSSIA.—A very good criterion to go by in regard to Russian home manufactories is the increased demand for boxwood in Russia, which article is largely used as shuttle blocks in the manufacture of cotton, silk, and woollen goods. The boxwood used in Russia is grown on the shores of the Caspian, in Persia, and in the spring of the year it reaches Astrachan and Nizni-Novgorod, where it is sold during the fair. The quantity sold there last year was about 130,000 poods, being about 8,0000 in excess of other years.
