The season is getting late, other points are drawing upon the stocks at primary markets, and, if lumber itself does not advance, the cost and difficulty of moving it are likely to increase, and there seems to be no reason for longer postponing orders. Agents of mills are therefore in receipt of an increasing number of orders, and for stock to arrive coastwise some have taken about all they can fairly attend to. On the export outlet the movement has not come up to expectations. Shippers have made some showing of interest, but did not close negotiations to any extent, and many transactions are still pending. Sellers, however, are hopeful that the increase in shipments over last year will be fully maintained.\n\nN.

We have to report another big week of shipments by water, the total being nearly 30,000,000 feet. There has been no recession in prices, and none is anticipated. Freights by lake remain at the rates previously reported, but there is a faint hope among dealers that another fleet like that which cleared from the river last week may break the market and give a lower rate. The shipment of lumber to Chicago has been quite free for the week, and orders are at hand for a good deal more.\n\nIsabella Walker—Riga—sleepers—Christie & Co.\nChristian—Haynas—sleepers—Order\nValkyrien—Riga—sleepers—Christie & Co.\nPucella—Riga—sleepers—Christie & Co.\nLudwig Burchard—Riga—sleepers—Christie & Co.\nJarden—Riga—sleepers—Love & Stewart\nFennu—Riga—sleepers, battens & props—Thomson\n\nCHARLESTOWN.\nFavorite—Christiansand—150 lds. prps.—Wallace\n\nDUNDEE.\nJoanna—Sarpborg—battens—H.
