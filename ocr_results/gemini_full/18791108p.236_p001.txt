236 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. [NOVEMBER 8, 1879.

LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.) Nov. 5th.

Since my last communication the arrivals of woods goods have continued to increase, so that my returns show seventy arrivals during last fourteen days. Dundee appears to have imported largely, as also Leith, Granton, and Alloa. Upwards of 50 cargoes are deals and battens, chiefly from Cronstadt, Wyborg, Riga, and Sweden. Norway contributes a very small portion. Several cargoes Baltic timber have arrived at Dundee, and one cargo Quebec timber at Granton. There are also several shipments of pit props at Bo'ness.
There is only one sale announced, viz., Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co., on the 18th, deals and battens, on the quay, head of Queen's Dock.
Messrs. Jas. Duncan and Co. offered for sale at their yards, Seafield and Assembly Street, on the 28th, American and Baltic timber, deals, &c. The sale was very well attended, many good buyers being present. The sale opened with waney pine, balance of cargo ex Forgenhall, and the whole lot, about 150 logs, was cleared out; also the Windau redwood found buyers. Flooring, lining, and sarking were not much in demand. The following prices were obtained:—
Waney pine 1s. 7 1/2d. to 1s. 9d. per cubic foot string measure.
Square „ 1s. 6d. „ „
Windau redwood first middling 1s. 1 1/2d. & 1s. 2d. per c. ft. calliper mea.

Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co., sold by public auction on the 4th, at the Victoria Docks, deals, battens, boards, &c. There was a good attendance of the trade, and numerous buyers were present, but great difficulty was experienced in getting bidders to come forward; ultimately, however, a start was made, and several large lots were placed. A good deal of time was occupied in introducing and offering for sale mouldings, &c., of Swedish manufacture. These consisted of artigals, architraves, batten rods, window wood, &c. The following prices were obtained, viz.:—
Artigals 2 x 7/8 2s. per 100 feet.

Messrs. Risk and Co. exposed for sale at their saw mills, Leith Walk to-day (6th), the entire cargo Quebec timber ex "East." The company was very large, and the demand and bidding appeared more favourably than for some time back, although prices obtained at previous sales were very encouraging.

In consequence of the length of time taken up in disposing of the various lots, and the catalogue not being nearly exhausted at five o'clock, no other prices can be enumerated.

HOW TO UTILIZE PINE CONES.—The Scientific American suggests that a large and profitable business might be made from gathering the cones in pine-growing regions and selling them in the large cities for fire kindling. It says dry pine cones are the universal article used on the Continent for that purpose. A couple of these is enough to start a fire of dry wood, and several of them to start a coal fire without other kindling. They are readily ignited with a match, and are free from dust and insects. In Paris, and other large cities on the Continent, scarcely any other than pine cones are used for kindling purposes in hotels, and it is a wonder to us that they have not been introduced for the same purpose here.

TREE PLANTING IN AUSTRALIA.—It is satisfactory to learn from the Annual Report of the Forest Board of South Australia, which has been sent to us by Mr. J. E. Brown, the Government Conservator of Forests, that public attention has been aroused in the colony during the past year to the importance of forest tree planting, and the conservancy of the indigenous timber. The provisions, however, of a recent Act passed for encouraging the planting of trees by landowners do not at present seem largely availed of, as the board have received one application only for land order on account of forest trees planted, in which case they were unable to grant the necessary certificate, as the planting had not been made in accordance with the Act.

HAVRE.—Mr. P. Noean, broker, of Havre, announces a sale of mahogany and fancy woods at that port on Wednesday next, the 12th inst., when the following goods will be offered:—2,668 rosewood planks, 9,359 logs and curls of Cuba, St. Domingo, Spanish, and Mexican mahogany; 9,462 pieces cedar, satinwood, tulip, lignum vitae, box, cocos, ebony, &c.
