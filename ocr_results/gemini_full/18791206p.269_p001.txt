BRISTOL.
(From Messrs. King Brothers' Circular, December 1st.)
At last there seems some revival in the timber trade, although business is not at all brisk. Prices during the past month have risen, and are now firm at their highest point. It rests entirely with the importers if they are kept at their present state or not, the market being still sensitive, and heavy importations are sure to lower it. Quebec goods.—Pine timber—Good quality commands full prices, ordinary quality very dull. Oak, elm, ash, birch, and walnut are reduced in stock, and are in fair demand. Pine deals—Prices are firm, but not much moving. Staves and lathwood—No sales to report. New Brunswick goods.—Spruce deals—Have been in good demand, and stocks are much reduced; prices have consequently risen, and are fairly firm at enhanced values. Birch—Prices are unchanged, but a little more doing. Memel, Danzic, &c., goods.—Fir timber—Dull. Wainscot oak—The prevalent low prices have caused a good consumption. Staves are in fair way goods.—Deals and demand; prices unchanged. Swedish and Norway battens—Demand slightly improved, but not sufficient to affect prices. Fir timber—Stocks and demand nominal, fresh sales 1st quality redwood small; lower qualities fair sale. St. Petersburg and White Sea goods.—deals move slowly at high rates, stock being but small; lower qualities are in fair demand, and prices are unaltered. Whitewood deals are

moving slowly at late prices. Lathwood—Very dull prices. United States goods. Pitch pine timber—Sales have been made at late rates, and is very bare. Walnut—Stocks are greatly reduced, and market firm. Staves—Rather better demand, and will be given. Mahogany—A cargo of Tonala wood is being shortly be offered by auction, of which due notice will be given. The arrivals for the past month consist of 2 vessels from Quebec, 2,558 tons; 3 from Archangel and Onega, 1,233 tons; 2 from Finland, 1,788 tons; 1 from Cronstadt, 268 tons; 6 from Sweden and Norway, 2,517 tons; and 2 from United States, &c., 854 tons; together 16 vessels, 9,218 tons register; against 21 vessels, 6,510 tons register for the corresponding month last year, showing an increase of 2,708 tons register to the present time there have been 111 vessels, 59,523 tons register arrived, against 135 vessels, 65,355 tons register, for the same period last year, showing a decrease of 5,832 tons register.
