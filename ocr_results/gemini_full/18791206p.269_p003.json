JOHN, N.B. (Mr. J. L. Woodworth's Circular, November 8th.).— Deal freights continue firm, with barely anything offering. Small crafts are scarce. Rates to New York and Boston are firm. We hear of the following charters to United Kingdom during the week:—Ship Riverdale, 1,490, deals, 66s. 9d., c.d. to Liverpool.\nTHE NAVIGATION OF THE BALTIC.—The following advices have been received from Lloyd's agents at the various Baltic ports. Gefle, Nov. 20, the navigation to this port may now be considered closed by ice. Two vessels, the Odin and Emma, left Skutskar harbour on the 25th, and they are probably the last which will load there this year. Karlstad, Nov. 24, the navigation here may be considered closed. Cronstadt, Nov. 25, since the 22nd Nov. no vessels have arrived or sailed; the Gulf is covered in all directions with fast ice. Narva, Nov. 25, since the 22nd Nov. navigation may therefore be considered closed. Stettin, Nov. 29, hard frost has set in, and navigation is closed for sailing vessels. Umea, Nov. 22, the navigation to this district was closed about three weeks, but Umea river has been closed by ice yesterday. The ice in the port (Bredskai and Holmsund) is yet open. During the last five years the shipping season commenced and closed as follows:—\n1874 commenced April 26, closed Nov. 14.\n1875 ,, May 15 ,, Nov. 17.\n1876 ,, May 13 ,, Nov. 15.\n1877 ,, May 23 ,, Dec. 22.\n1878 ,, April 27 ,, Nov. 28.\nNo British vessels are wintering here.\nTHE WHITE SEA.—The ice was reported to be rapidly forming in the Dwina on the 8th November, and the Archangel shipping season was looked upon as closed.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nHoffnung-Memel-tim. and deals-Melville oak-Order\nAuguste & Agnes-Riga-dls., &c.—McPherson\nSaga-Gustafsberg-battens-Order\nCeres-Memel-timber and deals-Brownlee\nAmicitia-Stettin-timber-Brownlee & Co.\nLouise Aguste-Riga-deals, &c.—McPherson\nH.
