At the same time, with the exception of the shipbuilding trade, the demand from consumers is of the most feeble character; and, small as stocks are, it is quite clear that all wants can be very amply satisfied. The house-building trade is not likely to be of any great importance are in progress, so that the wood goods required to supply the ordinary wear and tear incidental to the trade. For building timber the demand is therefore too small to have any influence in raising the values. For shipbuilding timber there is a considerable inquiry, and at present rate of using the stocks will be speedily be exhausted. American goods are the principal requirements of this trade; and for some descriptions of these goods a rise of at least 40 to 50 per cent. has taken place. For mining timber and pit props the prices remain firm; stocks are small, and no quantity expected forward before close of the season. In chartering, the season is about over; but during the last few days some ships have been fixed from Gothenburg to the Tyne, at 27s. 6d.\n\nGLASGOW.\n(From our own Correspondent.) Dec. 17th.\nDuring the past fortnight the wood trade here has undergone no important change. There have been no public sales, and the only arrivals to note are two cargoes at Greenock, one from Quebec, with pine timber, oak, &c., the other with pitch pine from Pensacola; and at Glasgow, a cargo of Cape Breton birch timber and sundry parcels of walnutwood and doors and mouldings per steamers from New York.\nFresh orders have been lately coming in to the shipbuilders; and in a short time our riverside will have quite an animated appearance. Meantime, old stocks are moving off at advanced rates, the import season being now about closed, and the quantities on hand very limited.\nThere is, however, very little doing in housebuilding, and poor prospects for some time to come, as a considerable amount of property is only partially let. Mahogany is wanted, the market being quite bare at present; all out of first hands a considerable time ago.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.\nDec. 4 Betty (s)-Danzig-staves-Order\n5 Coleridge (s)-Riga-sleepers-Order\n6 Lady Frances (s)-Riga-sleepers-Order\n8 Hilda-Borga-firewood-Order\nLord Collingwood (s)-St. Petersburg-lathwood-Order\n9 Hipparchus (s)-Bahia-rosewood-Order\nAntwerp-rosewood-P.

Dec. 17th.\nMy returns for last fortnight are very light, only about a dozen cargoes of various wood goods. The first arrivals looked for will be from Pensacola, &c., with pitch pine, probably at the end of January.\nThere has only been one sale this fortnight, viz., Messrs. James Duncan and Co., particulars of which are noted below. No sales are announced, and I do not hear of any that will take place for some time.\nMessrs. James Duncan and Co. offered for sale on the 9th, in their Assembly Street, various wood goods. There was a very large company, and the entire parcels were sold out at good prices. The competition was much keener than has been experienced for some time. First quality yellow pine deals was eagerly sought after; upwards of 3,000 were placed. White battens, 6½ x 2½, fetched high prices, also Kotka reds and Wyborg red deals. Two logs of mahogany were knocked down at 9½d. and 10d.
