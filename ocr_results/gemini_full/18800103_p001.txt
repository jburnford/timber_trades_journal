JANUARY 3, 1880.

THE TYNE.

There have been no arrivals of sawn wood goods during the last fourteen days, three cargoes of pit-props being almost the sole imports of timber.
The Christmas holidays, too, have combined with lack of arrivals to cause an entire dulness amongst all interested in the trade.
For the most part the manufactories, saw mills, &c., have either been making short time or totally suspended since 24th Dec., and in few cases will active work be resumed before January 5th.
The feeling gains ground that after that time we shall have more activity displayed, and that the spring will see not only higher prices, but also a much more active demand.
The advances named in my last as having taken place are still maintained, and on some goods still further rises are anticipated.
Hardwood timber is scarce, and some firms on the river have been importing from coast ports.
All goods used in shipbuilding are in active demand, but builders' trade is very quiet, and consumption of goods of a very limited character.
A very moderate demand in spring would quickly clear all the stocks now in the river unless shipments from Gothenburg are brought speedily to fill up the gap.
With the exception of one or two ships from Gothenburg now on the way, and a pitch pine cargo, there is but little to come forward.
Pit-props and mining timber are held in only small quantities, and for these prices are firmly upwards.
Mahogany is now entirely cleared out of Tyne dock.
For cheap battens a fair market can be had here now.

GLASGOW.

The timber market at this season of the year is usually quiet, consumers buying no more than is sufficient to meet the requirements of some pressing orders or contracts.
From the present standpoint a more cheering condition of things is looked forward to than has been experienced during the past year taken as a whole; but in business generally, some of our most important trades, a decided improvement has already taken place, the number of unemployed workmen being now comparatively small, and a general feeling of more comfort and confidence experienced by all classes of society.
Regarding the wood trade in particular, as carefully detailed statistical papers are now in preparation for the opening of the year, the present notes will be of a more general character.
With the exception of a large cargo—fully 400 standard—spruce deals from St. John, N.B., which arrived here last week, and two cargoes pitch pine, at Greenock, with several parcels oak planks, &c., our market may be considered as little changed since last report, and any augmentation of stock till next season's wood comes to hand will be trifling.
Such descriptions as superior elm, and waney boardwood are now of course, eagerly enquired for, and although there has been no public sale of timber for about six weeks, to test the market in the usual way, it is quite evident that there is in general a considerable power of consumption, and this in view of the small stocks held by sellers has materially improved prices.
As the work contracted for goes on, especially in shipbuilding, more wood will certainly be required.
From the return of the Clyde shipbuilding trade for 1879, it appears there have been completed during the year 170 vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 173,438 tons, as compared with 236 vessels and 222,353 tons during the year 1878.
With the exception of the year 1877 the returns are not quite so good as preceding years, but yet are wonderfully large considering the severe depression which prevailed during the greater portion of the year.
The housebuilding trade has suffered much during these dull times; it appears that in November, 1877, 3,080 journeymen joiners were employed in Glasgow, and at 1st

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.

November, 1879, only 1,224 were employed.
During the past two months however a change for the better has taken place, and workmen will likely be in greater demand as the season advances.
At the present time a rather favourable turn has been experienced in the property market: several large sales have been effected, and the number of properties advertised for sale is increasing.
The Dean of Guild court shows an increase of business, several applications having been recently sanctioned for the erection of new and additional buildings.
The cabinet-making trade was long severely depressed, but is now improving.
There were in all seven cargoes of mahogany imported here during the year, these when severally brought to auction were entirely cleared out with fair competition, the averages obtained ranging from 4 3/8d to 5 3/8d.
The cargoes consisted of Tabasco and Tonala wood and a small parcel of Minatitlan.
There is now no mahogany in first hand, and as ship builders have numerous heavy contracts to fulfil, fresh imports are urgently required.
It should also be borne in mind that this market is becoming more and more a centre of supply, having abundant means of cheap transit.

LEITH.

I have no arrivals to report this fortnight.
This is not unusual at this time of the year, and no arrivals can be expected for some time.
There are no public sales to report on, and there are at present none announced.
Mr. George Ellis, timber merchant, has suspended payment.
He has only been a short time in business; his liabilities are not very large.

THE TAY BRIDGE.

In view of the recent deplorable accident to this bridge the remarks made by one of our correspondents in the Timber Trades Journal of May 25, 1875, are peculiarly interesting.
From its immense height, especially at the Fife side, you know you are on it, I can assure you, and, as a rule, wish you were off it.
At least, I did the other day, when I thought I would have a shilling stroll across.
The wind rose to a squall, and sent my hat on a sea voyage; the girder ties clashed and clattered in a most peculiar and rather alarming manner, and up came panting and puffing a ballast train, causing as it passed a vibration that seemed (to my disturbed imagination at least) a caution, and made me wish myself well out of it all.
It may be reassuring after this to give an extract from the engineer's report:
“The vibration with the heaviest engine at the highest speed is scarcely perceptible, and the strongest gale has no effect whatever.”
So that I am afraid my experience will go for little or nothing with your readers.
