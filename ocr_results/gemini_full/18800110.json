It is, however, rumoured that things are going to look up, and that they are going to have mahogany brokers. The brokers, so it is said, are not going to sell under 4 1/2d. and so on; it is the same old cry of the wolf which does not come; and until the average price of mahogany cannot rise; good wood logs will always command their price; with the cabinet woods it is different, because the supply of furniture is greater than the demand.\nOne of the principal causes of this over-supply is the long credit which the merchants in the docks give to almost any one who cares to ask for it. In the same way the dealers in their turn trust the small cabinet makers, often young men just out of their apprenticeship, who finding they can get plenty of credit, start business for themselves; the consequences of this reckless system of trading are very evident. Go down the Curtain Road on a Saturday afternoon, and see there such a sight as is not soon forgotten—barrows, trucks, pony carts, vans, &c., full of all sorts of furniture good, bad, and indifferent; high art, low art, and mediocre; all to be sacrificed. It is really pitiful; the prices you hear offered and accepted would not pay for the wood, let alone the making; and see the crowd round the large building at the corner of the road at the New Street, the Auction Company's premises, getting an advance on their goods for absolute sale the next week; go the following Thursday and see the goods knocked down and sold, and then judge what was their advance to the men, and what they get for their timber. It is impossible for a large majority of them to pay for the wood, and naturally the small dealer cannot pay the dock people. If they would stop the giving of credit they do to that class of people, halt this risky trading would be obviated, and there might be a chance of a rise in mahogany. Until some steps are taken in this direction, it is difficult to see how there can be any improvement, unless we have another large wreckage of mahogany-laden ships, and the logs really lost this time.
