[JANUARY 1, 1881.
THE ORNAMENTAL WOOD OF THE FUTURE.
From the high degree of favour with which it won its way into the affections of the people of all nations, and the rapid strides with which it was received, the black walnut of America has in a wonderful manner displaced all the ornamental woods which had preceded it, and it stands the peer of them all, while it bids fair soon to be created for extinction.
The less than fifty years ago, it was of that mental to the prominent and relegate it to the [?] began to say that so little was it safe to end burned or more than was utilised for purposes of manufacture or commerce. When at last its value was discovered, and not a few of the farmers of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana became conservative in its preservation, they would have had the walnut timber growth of the Mississippi river in hand to have exhausted, while with the planting of groves, probably a century will be required to bring them to maturity. To-day the time will not supply the market with black walnut, and it is safe to assert that the United States has already been figured upon. When it will be difficult to obtain, no doubt the figures which have of the walnut of the black will be found for it? Perhaps old time favourites may regain some of their lost reputation, but we do not look to see them restored to the throne which the labour of the readiness with which they become cottage of the labouring man, forbid should ever be adapted to the economic situation and cheapened production will bring them into universal use. The aristocratic to
Oak has its many admirers, and its massive solidity, its majestic proportions, and the fact that it has abounded in nearly every land has it become so well known that it will be utilized in place of a wood which is destined to the extent of hundreds of millions of feet every year. Of course we make reference to the white oak. Live oak is too dense a wood for working, and the ordinary uses of the millions.
The red wood which is now like the poor Cinderella, as she sat in the corner, looked with envy upon her favoured sisters, and waited with patience and neglect awaiting the coming of the fairy who shall rescue it from obscurity, and place the beautiful slipper of public favour upon its foot. The wood is easy to work as is black walnut, and its weight is but little if any greater. It is a wood of marvellous beauty, of a pronounced and yet subdued character. While it is as light as white oak, and is not so apt to be taken as a choice wood as is ash. It is susceptible of a high polish, and its lightness may be toned with any desired shade of colour. It is durable, lasting well in all places where it is protected from being alternately wet and dry. Its specific gravity is light, and it will reach, three-quarters of a cent per pound. It is cheap, bearing to-day a value of about one-third that of first-grade walnut. It is found in the forests of all portions of the Pacific coast, bearing it in profusion. It is the ornamental wood of the future, yet to be appreciated at a greater neglect than was ever bestowed upon black walnut, although the day is not far distant when those who are fortunate enough to possess it will speak of the folly which permitted its wanton extirpation, in terms of the severest condemnation.
The red oak, which is used so extensively in the production of flour barrels, is a wood of fine straight grain, and but a small portion of the tree is being utilized, while the larger portion is left upon the ground. The red oak forests of Wisconsin and Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, of Illinois and Ohio, and in fact of every state in the American Union, will be within the next twenty years exhausted. The substitute for black walnut, which is now so commonly used in the construction of the finest parlour desks, and ornaments, is found in mahogany and rosewood. While black walnut is at present so highly appreciated, the sooner the wanton destruction of our forests is checked, and a wise policy of care of our timber lands is adopted.
