JANUARY 8, 1881.]

Pitch pine timber has been in but moderate request, hewn logs of large dimensions being mostly in demand; stocks are sufficient.
Good large wood would meet a fair market.
Stocks are very light.
Wainscot logs have until lately been inquired for, but now the demand appears to be satisfied.
Stocks are light.
Mahogany.—A cargo is now landed, and will shortly be submitted to public competition.
Ebony.—There have been two arrivals during the past month, which have met a fair inquiry.
Stocks are reduced, but prices are very low.

GLASGOW.
The only arrivals of foreign wood goods at Clyde ports during the past week have been two cargoes of New Brunswick deals (one of which goes direct into consumers' hands), and at Grangemouth one cargo of deals and battens.
The New Year holidays, as held chiefly by the artisans, &c., in public works and shipbuilding yards, are now about over, rather less time being allowed this year than usual as work is pressing.
The few days' cessation of work twice a year are taken advantage of by masters to make necessary repairs and improvements on their working plant, &c., so that the time is not lost.
From statistics in course of preparation it may be noted, in regard to waney board wood, that the stock on hand in Clyde ports is about an eighth less than the average of the last four years, while Quebec pine deals—a considerable proportion being 1st quality—amount to about one-fourth more than the average of the last four years.
Taking into consideration the favourable outlook at present for ship finishings, &c., during the spring of the year, it is to be expected that an adequate demand will be met with for these combined stocks.
With reference to the new Municipal Buildings, it is now under consideration to invite designs for a structure to cost £250,000, as none of the designs which can be executed for £150,000, or thereby (the sum formerly proposed), are such as the committee on the buildings can recommend the magistrates and council to accept.

LEITH.
The imports this week consist of merely two cargoes of deals from Riga, and one cargo of deals and battens from Sundswall.
As was to be expected, almost no business has been done since the close of the year, most of the saw-mills being still closed.
Merchants in this quarter are beginning the year with in most cases heavy stocks, but there does not seem to be any tendency to push them into the market.
