PROSECUTION OF A SAW-MILL PROPRIETOR UNDER THE FACTORY ACT.—At the Longton Police-court, before Messrs. J. H. Hawley and J. F. Wileman, Mr. Stephen Mear, the proprietor of a steam saw-mill, in High Street, Longton, was charged with an infringement of the Factory Act, by neglecting to securely fence the crank shaft of a steam engine, in consequence of which neglect, it was alleged, an engine-driver, named Jas. Timmis had been killed. Mr. Cramp, sub-inspector of factories, said that he visited defendant's mill on September 3rd, 1879. On that occasion he saw Mr. Mear, jun. and pointed out to him that the Factory Act required that the fly-wheel and every part should be securely fenced. On June 23rd he again visited the mill, and then found that the fly-wheel had been fenced since his previous visit, while the crank-shaft was not fenced at all. He made a third visit on December 10th, to inquire about the accident which had taken place on the previous day. On each occasion he saw Mr. Mear, jun., and not only called attention to the engine and crank-shafts, but made suggestions as to what should be done. Samuel Haywood, a sawyer, described the nature of the accident which had happened to the man Timmis, and, in answer to Mr. Hawley, witness stated that it was his opinion that from the position of the man's legs it would not have mattered whether the fencing as now suggested by Mr. Cramp was not the fencing within the meaning of the section on which the case was brought. His contention was that the engine-house, being a building so constructed that there was no proper access to it except by the person working the engine, was from that very fact sufficiently fenced. The magistrates contended, they contended, in an act where there had been fencing or not, there was no material difference in the case. The learned gentleman further submitted that notice to fence the engine had been served in writing upon the defendant. It had, however, not been done, and he should submit on that ground alone the magistrates ought to dismiss the case. There was, however, another point which he thought must be fatal, supposing their worships were against him in the objections already raised. It was not sufficient that the inspector should show that an accident had happened, and that a man had been killed, but he must go further, and prove beyond doubt that in-sufficient fencing was the cause of it. In this he had also failed. Several witnesses having been called for the defence, the magistrates decided to go and inspect the engine-house for themselves, and upon their return, the Stipendiary stated that they thought the accident was entirely the result of the man's own negligence. If he had taken proper care the accident ought not to have happened, and under the circumstances the summons must be dismissed. Mr. Hawley said his client was prepared to carry out any suggestions Mr. Cramp might recommend. He also stated that arrangements for the benefit of the unfortunate man's family.

EPPS'S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.—" By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame."—Civil Service Gazette.
