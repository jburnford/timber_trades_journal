RAYNER & MOLLER, of Sunderland, in their trade circular, dated January 29th, report as follows :-Twelve months ago prices for pit-props and mining timber stood very high, compared with the low rates ruling during the first nine months of 1879. Shippers abroad, thinking that prices would still further advance, went into the market and bought large quantities of wood from the forest-owners, which they hoped would realize high prices. In this, however, they were sorely disappointed ; and not a few shippers must have lost heavily in their speculations, inasmuch as prices began to fall, even towards the latter part of January, 1880, and have, until within the last few days, been lower than at any time since 1869. Stocks on this side are at present large, and shippers abroad, not having been able to rid themselves of last year's stocks, are, consequently, unable to speculate in further produce from the forests. Some of the largest shippers of propwood in Norway and Sweden are known positively to have withdrawn from the trade. Operations in Scandinavia, so far as propwood and mining timber are concerned, are therefore at present on a limited scale, and the principal lots now offered for shipment in the general market are what have been left over from last season. The recent severe weather, with heavy frost, has stopped navigation from the chief shipping ports ; and should importations be prevented, even for a short time, stocks on this side will rapidly disappear, and prices in all probability advance. Should prices rise to such an extent as to induce shippers to seek fresh produce from the forests, they have but a limited time in which to perform the work, and might meet with difficulties, occasioned by the severe weather, which would hinder the production materially. Recent years of trade have proved anything but remunerative to either shippers or importers ; and shippers are not likely to speculate in producing goods for the market on chance, whilst importers are not inclined to enter into contracts at prices now demand, knowing that to-day, owing to the position of the market, they could not again sell the goods at prices to leave them a profit. This hesitation in speculation has nothing to do with the consumption, which goes on undisturbed, whilst no adequate steps are being taken to replace stocks in such a degree as to satisfy requirements for the year ; and it is not unlikely that further on in the year propwood and mining poles will rise in price, the heavier dimensions of wood with a good diameter at the top, and upwards, being most in request.",
