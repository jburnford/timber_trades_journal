CHARGE OF FRAUD.—GEORGE ANDREWS, of 119, Latimer Road, Notting Hill, appeared before the Thames police-court on Monday last, on an adjourned summons for obtaining credit by false pretences to the extent of £150 from Mr. J. R. Boyce, a timber merchant carrying on business at Granite Wharf, Wapping. William Clements, of 203, Kingsland Road, Islington, clerk to the prosecutor, said on the 25th of October the defendant came to his master for more wood, and Mr. Boyce said, “I don’t like your continuing borrowing money of me to meet your bills; therefore, before going into the question of any more wood, I should like to know something of your position.” Andrews said, “My position is very good, and you need not fear serving me. It is only a little temporary pressure. I have large amounts owing on my books, and moneys have not come in so well lately as they should. I am doing a good business, and at better prices than most people in the trade.” He was allowed to select what wood he wanted. On the 17th of December a bill of Andrews’ fell due, but it was dishonoured. When called upon him he said he had nothing whatever, and that he owed a great deal of money, altogether about £1,200, and that he had nothing to pay the bank. Mr. William Williams, secretary to the Bayswater and Notting Hill Loan Society, said the defendant was one of the trustees of that society. Witness had discounted bills for the defendant, for which he was now a creditor. In October the defendant owed £963, all in respect of money advanced in some form or other ; thought he had security for it. Witness always thought the defendant was in a position to pay if he had time. Mr. Douglas Priest, an auctioneer, said he had lent the defendant money on several occasions. He began to discount bills for him six or eight months ago. On the 29th of October, he lent him £25 on the security of a house, and on the 27th of November following, he lent him £25 on the security, and the defendant then said he wanted no security. Mr. Saunders adjourned the investigation of the case for a week, and accepted bail for the defendant’s appearance.
