in the process.
The threads are now ready, must be tied in couples at the ends, as they can be woven.
This work is done by boys, and in Ehrenberg little creatures of four years old and upwards are employed at it, and earn fourpence a day.
The weaving is done chiefly by women, in looms which differ considerably from those in ordinary use, the being being, as before mentioned, not more than from 30 to 32 in. in length.
The longer fibres form the warp, the shorter (28 to 32 in.), the woof, which is passed in and out by means of a little instrument with an eye like a needle.
Until within the last few years, this concluded the whole process—the “foundations,” as they are called, were complete, and nothing more was done, except that a few hats and caps were made of them; but these were of the very simplest description, and pleasant to wear only because they fetched anything but becoming.
Moreover, they were glued together, which made them very unpleasant to wear in hot or wet weather, and accordingly they fetched but fifteenpence or 2s. 4d. per dozen, and were worn only by the very lowest classes.
Within the last few years, however, a great change for the better has taken place, due probably in part to the interest shown by the Government in the manufacture, in part perhaps to an improvement of an enterprising firm, and in part have at last to the fact that the Ehrenbergers have at last become alive to their own interests.
At present Ehrenberg sends out not only the plain but ready-made goods—fashionable hats of all kinds, and a variety of fancy articles concocted out of the wood fabric, of every possible description and the like, such as no one need be ashamed to wear, made entirely of wood, and sold at very low prices.
Men's hats are to be had, from the Panama hat—not a whit inferior to that bought in Paris—to the common hat, in large quantities to China, and the fez of the Turkish soldier.
The export trade from Europe, from Spain to Russia, extends over the Caucasus to India and China, and maintains active relations with North and South America as well as Australia.
The manufacturers are in direct communication with the four quarters of the world, and their goods are being introduced into Africa by French and English traders.—*Cassell's Family Magazine*.

LEARNING TO BE A COOPER.
It is related of Stephen Girard that he had a favourite clerk, and he always said he would do well by Ben. Lippincott.
So when Ben got to be 21 he expected to hear the governor say something of his future prospects, and perhaps lend a helping hand in starting him in the world.
But the old fox carefully avoided the subject.
Ben mustered courage: “I suppose I am now free, sir?” said he, “and I thought I would say something to you as to my course.
What do you think I had better do?”
“Yes, yes, I know you are,” said the old millionaire, “and my advice is to go and learn the cooper's trade.”
This application of ice nearly froze Ben out; but recovering his equilibrium he said if Mr. Girard was in earnest he would do so.
“I am in earnest.”
And Ben forthwith sought the best cooper in Spring Gardens, became an apprentice, and in due time could make as good a barrel as the best.
He announced to old Stephen that he had graduated and was ready to set up in business.
The old man seemed gratified, and immediately ordered three of the best barrels he could turn out.
Ben did his prettiest, and wheeled them up to the old man's counting-room.
Old Girard pronounced them first-rate, and demanded the price.
“One dollar each,” said Ben, “is as low as I can live by.”
“Cheap enough! Make out your bill.”
The bill was made out, and old Stephen settled it with a check for 20,000 dols., which he accompanied with this little moral to the story: “There, take that and invest it in the best possible manner; and if you are unfortunate to lose it, you will have a good trade to fall back upon, which will afford you a good living.”—*Industrial World*.
