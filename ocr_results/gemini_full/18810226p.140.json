Very large sums of money are invested in this branch of industry, and the statistics of trade show that of late years the demand for pine has very greatly increased. In pine alone last year the gain in the demand over that of 1879 reached fully 15 per cent. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota supplied in 1880 6,000,000,000 ft., and of that large amount the former state furnished from its five hundred mills nearly two-thirds of the whole quantity. This estimate does not include several millions of feet which are cut up every year into shingles, stave-bolts, the square timber shipped from the state, the logs and timber towed down the lakes to supply mills of Ohio and New York ports, or the wood which is used in the manufacture of tubs, pails, buckets, &c.\nIn 1832 lumber was first made in the Saginaw Valley. In 1835 another mill, having a capacity of 2,000,000 ft. per annum, was started under exceedingly favourable auspices. The business increased until the panic of 1836, when things were quiet until 1849. Times then improved somewhat, and several new mills were started. In 1870 there were 83 mills in operation, sawing 576,726,600 ft. of lumber. Since that year there has, however, been a steady decrease of mills in operation in the Saginaw Valley, last year there were in total only of 69. The production of lumber has increased very materially, the amount cut last year being 863,356,000 ft. The total capacity of the mills in the Saginaw Valley is now 923,000,000 ft. per annum.\nThe bulk of this lumber is transported by water to Ohio and New York ports, and finds its way into the eastern markets ; some of it is also shipped by vessels to Chicago and Milwaukee, and is afterwards distributed by rail throughout the west.\nPrices for pine lands, last year, were quoted at 10 to 50 dols. per acre, according to location and the quality of the timber thereon. Some prices of land ranged from 50 dols. to 100 dols. per acre. The business is conducted for the most part by syndicates, and in a few years it is thought the whole trade will drift into the hands of a few operators. The market for lumber in the Saginaw Valley ruled firm during the whole season at 12 dols., and 30 dols. for ordinary stock ; choice grades, however, were frequently held at very high, and in small parcels.\nThe best quality was scarce, and the demand exceeded the supply. Dry lumber ruled very high, and in small parcels.\nA letter from which these interesting and valuable facts are taken concludes with these remarks :—\n“The forests of Michigan would last, at the present rate of destruction, about eleven years. This loss, it is thought, will not work irreparable injury to the commercial interests of the state, as the ground once covered with pine has been found to be remarkably well adapted for agricultural pursuits. The owners of the territory at present covered with timber can therefore rest assured of a satisfactory future for their possessions, while others interested may confide in a continued prosperity for Michigan when the transformation of the forests for fields has been accomplished.”\n\nINTERESTING TO CREDITORS.—A builder who had been in business only a year became bankrupt, with a large amount of debt. He returned his assets at £10. Shortly before the declaration of bankruptcy he gave his brother a bill of sale, and said he had sold one house to a sweep, another to a travelling dealer, and a cart to a blacksmith. Cases so bad as this may not be very numerous, but the same cannot be said of cases a few shades less flagrant, and they call for a strict Act to curb them.",
