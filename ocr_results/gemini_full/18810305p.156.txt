BUILDERS' CLERKS' BENEVOLENT INSTITUTION.
The annual general meeting of this institution was held on the 22nd ult., at the offices, 27, Farringdon Street, under the presidency of Mr. Stanley G. Bird, who was supported by a large number of friends of the institution, amongst whom were Mr. S. T. Holland, Mr. H. H. Colls, Mr. T. Stirling, Mr. W. Heath, Mr. H. T. Bayes, Mr. E. Graystone, Mr. E. Brooks, Mr. J. Robson, Mr. E. C. Roe, and Mr. H. J. Wheatley (secretary).
In the annual report the committee congratulate late donors and subscribers on the increase in the annual revenue, observing that while some societies still suffer by the general depression in trade, the balance-sheet of the Builders' Clerks' Institution shows an increase of £139 12s. 11d. beyond that for the preceding year. The total number of pensioners at the present time on the relief is ten, and there are two children being maintained and educated in connection with the orphan fund. During the year temporary relief has also been afforded. A further investment has been made of £300, of which sum £100 was placed to the relief fund, and £200 to the orphan fund. In closing the report, the committee say that there is good cause to be satisfied with the progress made since the institution was founded in 1866, and express the hope the same support will be continued in the future.
The financial statement showed the subscriptions to be £186 7s. 6d. ; donations, £163 16s. on the relief fund. The income of the orphan fund was £741 14s. 2d. The total income of the institution was £2,091 5s.
The Chairman, in moving the adoption of the report and balance-sheet, stated that much credit was due to the secretary and committee for the economical manner in which the business had been conducted. He might, however, be permitted to state that with their present machinery much more might be done, and it must be their careful study to enlarge the society as much as possible.
Mr. Brooks seconded the motion, and the report and balance-sheet were adopted. A vote of thanks was presented to Mr. S. T. Holland, the retiring president, and Mr. Holland replied. The committee were reappointed, and thanks were tendered for their past services.
