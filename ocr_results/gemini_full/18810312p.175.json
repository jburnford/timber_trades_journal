It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.”—Civil Service Gazette.\nSold only in Packets labelled—“JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London.”—Also makers of Epps’s Chocolate Essence for afternoon use.—Advt.\n\n175\nSHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\nFREIGHTS.\nQUEBEC.—Mr. Falkenberg, in his circular dated February 21st, states as follows:—The number of sailing vessels here last season was greatly in excess of the year previous, as the following figures will show, viz.:—1880, 895 vessels, 706,346 tons; 1879, 566 vessels, 492,676 tons; 213,670 tons more, in 1880. The stock of wood goods wintering is much smaller than the average, and consists as follows, viz., merchantable and culls. Deals, 2,141,253 pcs., equal to say 29,740 Petersburg stds.; timber, 9,686,873 cubic ft., equal to say 193,738 loads of 50 cubic ft. Owing to small stocks we do not look for a large spring fleet, but expect that the arrivals in midsummer and fall will make up for the deficiency, as the quantity of wood goods making for shipment is large. I am of opinion that freights will open low, and for very early ships would recommend my friends not to miss fixing on the other side if anything like fair rates can be got. For later ships I think prospects will improve, as the new supplies of timber, &c., come forward, and that vessels will do better by trusting to this market.\n\nFOREIGN CLEARANCES.\nPENSACOLA.—Feb. 15th, Ulrika, Greenock, with 33,340 c. ft. sawn timber, 31,890 c. ft. hewn do., and 505,028 ft. lumber, 648 tons; Giulietta, Lisbon, with 2,300 c. ft. sawn timber, 1,200 c. ft. hewn do., and 625 ft. lumber, 438 tons; 16th, Kalewa, Dordrecht, with 6,704 c. ft. sawn timber, 18,445 c. ft. hewn do., and 11,771 ft. lumber, 500 tons; Lisa, Cardiff, with 40,960 c. ft. sawn timber and 16,992 ft. lumber, 763 tons; Persevere, Cherbourg, with 22,933 c. ft. hewn timber and 56,392 ft. lumber, 498 tons; 17th, Rinde, Liverpool, with 13,121 c. ft. sawn timber, 23,608 c. ft. hewn do., and 39,025 ft. lumber, 588 tons; Queen, Glasgow, with 38,682 c. ft. sawn timber and 23,695 ft. lumber, 759 tons; The N’jord, London, with 2,707 c. ft. sawn timber, with 2,707 c. ft. hewn do., and 33,000 ft. lumber, 714 tons; Feb. 19th, Fr. bk.

The others, viz., the Norden, Albert Edward, and Otto, remain in Rifofjord, being unable to force through the ice channel.\nThe Fardig (s) is trying to work up to these vessels through the outer ice channel. The work of sawing the ice for inward-bound steamers is progressing.\nELSINORE, March 4th.—The fairway is full of ice, with small openings between. Steam communication with Helsingborg continues. The ice is fast to southward.\nBOLDERAA, March 2nd.—The ice at sea has drifted three German miles from the coast, but the channel is still closed.\nCALMAR, Feb. 28th.—On Feb. 25th the ice in the southern part of Calmar Sound, on the track from Presto to Krysspriken, was examined in several places and found to be from 18 to 20 in. thick.\nCHRISTIANIA, March 3rd.—Christiania fjord is frozen over from Drobak to Fœrder.
