EPPS’S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING. —“By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors’ bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.”—Civil Service Gazette.

SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
FREIGHTS.
QUEBEC.—Mr. Falkenberg, in his circular dated February 21st, states as follows:—The number of sailing vessels here last season was greatly in excess of the year previous, as the following figures will show, viz.:—1880, 895 vessels, 706,346 tons; 1879, 566 vessels, 492,676 tons; 213,670 tons more, in 1880. The stock of wood goods wintering is much smaller than the average, and consists as follows, viz., merchantable and culls. Deals, 2,141,253 pcs., equal to say 29,740 Petersburg stds.; timber, 9,686,873 cubic ft., equal to say 193,738 loads of 50 cubic ft. Owing to small stocks we do not look for a large spring fleet, but expect that the arrivals in midsummer and fall will make up for the deficiency, as the quantity of wood goods making for shipment is large. I am of opinion that freights will open low, and for very early ships would recommend my friends not to miss fixing on the other side if anything like fair rates can be got. For later ships I think prospects will improve, as the new supplies of timber, &c., come forward, and that vessels will do better by trusting to this market.

THE NAVIGATION.
ELSINORE.—According to advices received a short time since, it is stated that the ice in the neighbourhood of the Sound is of a thickness of 15 ft. at some places, being the greatest thickness in comparison with all previous winters.
ELSINORE, March 3rd.—There is new ice all over the fairway, but it does not obstruct the communication with Helsingborg. To southward the ice is fast.
GOTHENBURG, March 1st.—The Bjorn (s), from London for this port, put into Hirtshalsand yesterday. She encountered ice at Larssons Grund, and off the Scaw it was too heavy to force through.
March 2nd.—Of the upward-bound steamers, the Bele is the only one which has got into dock. The others, viz., the Norden, Albert Edward, and Otto, remain in Rifofjord, being unable to force through the ice channel.
The Fardig (s) is trying to work up to these vessels through the outer ice channel. The work of sawing the ice for inward-bound steamers is progressing.
ELSINORE, March 4th.—The fairway is full of ice, with small openings between. Steam communication with Helsingborg continues. The ice is fast to southward.
BOLDERAA, March 2nd.—The ice at sea has drifted three German miles from the coast, but the channel is still closed.
CALMAR, Feb. 28th.—On Feb. 25th the ice in the southern part of Calmar Sound, on the track from Presto to Krysspriken, was examined in several places and found to be from 18 to 20 in. thick.
CHRISTIANIA, March 3rd.—Christiania fjord is frozen over from Drobak to Fœrder. From Fredrikvoern ice is seen to-day everywhere. Frost to-day, 15 degrees.
WISBY, March 2nd.—According to intelligence from Sundre, the steamers Sofia, Neptun, and Hero are lying together in the ice about three miles S.W. of Hoburg. The sea is everywhere covered with ice.
