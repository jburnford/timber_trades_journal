THE NAVIGATION.
COPENHAGEN, March 19th.—The port of Copenhagen is now open for steamers.—In Sound north of Copenhagen and fairwa, but sailors will have to wait a few days. The ice is breaking up in the harbour.
COPENHAGEN, March 20th.—In Drogden the navigaton is now open for steamers, but sailers will have to wait a few days.
The Newcastle Chronicle of the 19th inst. says that "if the intelligence we have received to-day by telegram from three or four sources be confirmed by the arrival of steamers on Monday which have left Elsinore and Frederickshaven bound to the Tyne, the real business of the year from the Baltic will be started next week. These arrivals will confirm the intelligence of to-day, that the Sound and Belt are reopened. Messrs. Milburn & Co., Queen Street, have information from Copenhagen that the navigation is open to Korsor, and the firm are instructed to send the steamers out which were waiting. Mr. Hassal was also informed by his agent at Copenhagen to the effect that the ice was all loose in the Sound, while a telegram from Messrs. Nielsen & Andersen had a Copenhagen to the effect that the ice was rapidly disappearing there, and they were getting rid of it quickly."
CHRISTIANIA, March 15th.—The entrance to the Fjord is now closed by sea-ice, which is piled up several feet thick between Faerder and Fuglehuk; inside of that point the water is navigable for steamers. The places on the coast up to Christian-sand are still closed by ice. The weather is now mild.
DANTZIC, March 17th.—It is reported to-day from Neufahrwasser that Dantzic Bay is again full of drift ice.
ELSINORE, March 19th.—Owing to fresh W.N.W. breeze and rising water during the last two days, the ice along the coast to southward broke away yesterday afternoon and drifted off, so that the fairway here is entirely free of ice to-day as far as the eye can reach.
HALMSTAD, March 15th.—On the coast there is an open space of considerable size; at sea, heavy drift ice floating northwards.
MEMEL, March 14th.—The Sound here is quite free of drift ice to-day. Frost this morning 7 degs. Landscrona harbour was accessible yesterday afternoon, and there was open water to southward of that place as far as the eye could reach.
CASUALTIES.
MELBOURNE.—January 29th.—Leonard ship, which arrived at Adelaide Jan. 24th from Calix, encountered such a terrific gale after leaving Copenhagen that the deckload of timber was all sent adrift and had to be jettisoned.
