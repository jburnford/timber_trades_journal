THE WAGES OF CLYDE SHIP JOINERS.—The ship joiners in the Glasgow district have presented a requisition to the employers asking for an advance of 7½ per cent. on the existing rate of wages.
The men are very fully employed, and in all other branches of labour in the shipbuilding trade it is said wages have been increased.
JOINERS' WAGES ON THE TYNE.—The joiners employed at Messrs. Wigham, Richardson, & Co.'s shipyard, Walker, have received an advance of 1s. per week, and have now the highest wages paid on this river.

[APRIL 2, 1881.
AMERICAN AND CANADIAN ITEMS.
The Mississippi Valley Lumberman says that in the north-west there will be 250,000,000 ft. more lumber cut than in 1880.

The Pensacola Gazette of the 8th ult. says that last week there was a jump in timber—an average advance of 1½ cents per ft. within two days.
We have seen in many a day a day's lot of hewn Pensacola railway this morning on a train something less than a mile long."

A gentleman, who has recently been travelling through the lumber regions of Georgia and Florida, writes to the Lumberman that he never saw so many vessels on demurrage at the principal shipping points before.
They are prevented from loading through the inability of the mills to supply them with cargoes, the long-continued rains having made it impossible for the manufacturers to get the logs to saw.
In many cases the mules work in water up to their haunches hauling logs, and after they are hauled, many of the streams are so full, it is dangerous to raft them.

It is alleged that a black walnut tree was recently cut by Henry Herrmann, near Pound Gap, Ky., that contains 35,000 ft. of lumber.
The body of the tree measures 12 ft. in diameter, and the tree limbs measure each 6 ft. in diameter.
A section of the tree will shortly be shipped to New York for exhibition, and also one to London, England, for the same purpose.

The North-western Lumberman, in its report from Chicago, March 9th, says that "the present condition of the principal markets may be concisely described as quiet and firm.
The assertion perhaps needs a little qualification.
It does not necessarily mean that trade is dull, but merely that no excitement attends the transaction of business, that prices are steady, and that the market generally is free from disturbing features.
It may be said boldly that business is not dull for this time in the season."

An elm was recently carried to Boughton & West's mill, Grand Traverse, Mich., that scaled 4,108 ft.

CANADIAN FOREST COMMISSION.
THE necessity of a commission of forestry, having well-defined powers to regulate the cutting of timber and the disposition of the débris resulting from the operations of the lumberman, to the end that forest fires and their destructiveness may be prevented, and as well to inaugurate such schemes for the perpetuation as well as planting of forests as shall enable future generations to enjoy at least a modicum of the benefits which are now being realized by the inhabitants of the land, is fast impressing itself upon all who have given attention to the subject.
A correspondent of a Canadian journal gives some facts regarding the manufacture of flatted and square timber in the Dominion that illustrate the need of Government supervision over the forests of that country, which apply no less to the forests of the United States.

Mr. Aubrey White, of Bracebridge, Ont., after making the assertion that "any attempt to estimate the timber wealth of the Dominion can at best amount only to theorizing of the vaguest description"—a statement, by the way, equally applicable to the timber of the United States, under all present known means of estimating the volume of standing timber—adds that "there is no one capable of forming a correct idea of when we shall run out of timber, or of the number of millions remaining uncut."
Mr. White thinks, so far as the Dominion is concerned, there will never be formed "a correct idea of our lumber wealth, how it is wasted, or what steps are necessary to conserve it, until Government appoints a commission of practical men who shall take evidence at various points."
Regarding the present waste, and the dangers resulting therefrom, Mr. White says the cut of board timber (by this is meant partially squared long timber, from which the roughest of the slabs have been removed, for convenience and economy of transportation) in the Muskoka district will amount to 20,000 pieces during the current season, equalling 1,275,000 cubic, or 15,300,000 ft. board measure, in the manufacture of which he estimates a loss of two saw logs, averaging 200 ft. each, to each tree, or 40,000 logs, aggregating 8,000,000 ft. of lumber, which will be cut from the tops of the trees and left in the woods to rot or to furnish food for flames, in addition to which he estimates a loss of 1,000,000 ft. in scoring and hewing, or an aggregate loss of 9,000,000 ft. in the preparation of 15,300,000 ft. of board pine timber, or about 63 per cent. of the gross amount of the standing timber utilized, and 37 per cent. wasted.
