Wm. Thomson & Co. offered for sale by public auction several cargoes of deals and battens, pitch pine and birch.\nThe sale was started with the *Laura*, from Pictou, lying in George Street yard the company being at this time very small.\nThe stuff was of poor quality and only realized 14d. to 14½d. per cubic foot, at which price, however, it was all cleared away.\nAn attempt was made to dispose of a cargo of Norwegian battens lying in the same yard.\nThis, however, completely failed, not even a starting bid being forthcoming.\nAn adjournment was then made to the sands, at the foot of Constitution Street, where the cargo of pitch pine ex *Islay* was lying.\nAlthough the company was now considerably increased, bidders were still reluctant to come forward; consequently only two or three lots were sold, at from 17d. to 18d., one lot being knocked down at 15½d.: this was, however, small-sized timber.\nNo bidder coming forward for the remainder of the cargo of pitch pine deals, the company were conducted to the Albert Docks, where several lots of deals and battens were offered, but met with no buyers.\nMessrs. Jas. Duncan & Co., Brownlee & Co., Mitchell, Somerville, & Co., and Mitchell, Thomson, & Co. have announced public sales.\n\nTIMBER EXPORTS FROM LONDON.\nMar. 21 Sydney—138 lds. deals\n22 Cape Town—25 lds. deals\nGhent—200 cwt. ebony\nOporto—66 lds. staves\nSydney—222 lds. deals\n24 Adelaide—83 lds. deals\nMossel Bay—19 lds sawn fir\nParis—£26 hardwood\nTrieste—21 tons mahogany\n26 Port Phillip—116 lds. deals\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nIMPORTS.\n[*For the purpose of economizing space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.—ED.*]\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nCARDIFF.\nMar. 31 Reine des Flots—Meschers—110 lds. pitwood—Order\nApril 2 Vulture—Bordeaux—519 lds. pitwood—Jones\n4 Ben Nevis—Bordeaux—1,000 lds. pitwood—Jones\nHULL.\nApril 4 Patria—Tvedestrand—2,664 pcs. round mining timber, 2,027 props—H.

Neill & Clink, underwriters' surveyors.\nThe vessel is found to have received very considerable damage to her hull, while her forefoot and a large portion of the keel have been carried away.\nThis disaster, taken in connection with her abandonment in the Atlantic last year, will make her cost the underwriters a considerable sum from first to last.\nAfter being repaired The Craigs will probably be again sent to Quebec.",
