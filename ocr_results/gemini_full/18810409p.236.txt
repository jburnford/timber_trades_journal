LEITH.
Little business has been doing during the past week, although with the fine spring weather building operations should get fairly away.
The only importation at this port is a parcel of oak staves from New York.
Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co. offered for sale by public auction several cargoes of deals and battens, pitch pine and birch.
The sale was started with the *Laura*, from Pictou, lying in George Street yard the company being at this time very small.
The stuff was of poor quality and only realized 14d. to 14½d. per cubic foot, at which price, however, it was all cleared away.
An attempt was made to dispose of a cargo of Norwegian battens lying in the same yard.
This, however, completely failed, not even a starting bid being forthcoming.
An adjournment was then made to the sands, at the foot of Constitution Street, where the cargo of pitch pine ex *Islay* was lying.
Although the company was now considerably increased, bidders were still reluctant to come forward; consequently only two or three lots were sold, at from 17d. to 18d., one lot being knocked down at 15½d.: this was, however, small-sized timber.
No bidder coming forward for the remainder of the cargo of pitch pine deals, the company were conducted to the Albert Docks, where several lots of deals and battens were offered, but met with no buyers.
Messrs. Jas. Duncan & Co., Brownlee & Co., Mitchell, Somerville, & Co., and Mitchell, Thomson, & Co. have announced public sales.

CASUALTIES.
THE STRANDED BARQUE “THE CRAIGS.”—This vessel has now been discharged and docked at Greenock, and a survey has been held upon her by Messrs. Neill & Clink, underwriters' surveyors.
The vessel is found to have received very considerable damage to her hull, while her forefoot and a large portion of the keel have been carried away.
This disaster, taken in connection with her abandonment in the Atlantic last year, will make her cost the underwriters a considerable sum from first to last.
After being repaired The Craigs will probably be again sent to Quebec.
