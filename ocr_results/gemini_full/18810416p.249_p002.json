Mr. F. C. Willis (instructed by Messrs.

The debts were estimated at about £5,000, and assets £1,900. The following creditors had commenced proceedings:—Messrs. Eldridge & Youngman, Bermondsey, for £20 6s. 8d.; Johnson Brothers & Co.

In reply to Mr. Registrar Pepys, Mr. Tee said that the application was made with the concurrence of creditors; and his Honour made the desired appointment, and granted an injunction.\nR.
