The assets are fixed at £1,694. The debtor made an offer of 2s. 6d. in the £, which was refused, and it was resolved to wind up the estate in liquidation.
HENRY SAALA.—The debtor, described as of Heathfield House and the Britannia Works, Westbourne Park, builder and contractor, has filed a liquidation petition, and his affairs were brought before Mr. Registrar Pepys on Monday. Mr. F. C. Willis (instructed by Messrs. Preston & Co.) applied for the appointment of Mr. Samuel Lovelock, accountant, 19, Coleman Street, as receiver of the estate, and for an injunction restraining various actions. The debts were estimated at about £5,000, and assets £1,900. The following creditors had commenced proceedings:—Messrs. Eldridge & Youngman, Bermondsey, for £20 6s. 8d.; Johnson Brothers & Co. (limited), Waterloo Place, £400; Richard Harland, Chislehurst, £297 18s. 4d.; the North West London Loan and Discount Company (limited), £64 15s.; Rose, Smith, & Co., Rotherhithe, £50 13s. 9d.; Delf & Aston, Fulham Road, £96 4s. 11d.; Corkhill, Prince's Street, Notting Hill, £62 10s.; Brooks, Phillips, & Co., Paddington Green, £70; and by Mr. Homewood, of Brighton, for £62. His Honour made the desired appointment, and granted an injunction until after the statutory meeting, to be held on the 28th inst., at three o'clock, at New Court Chambers, Chancery Lane.
CHIVERS AND HARRIS.—This case was brought before the court on Tuesday. The debtors, George Chivers and Joseph Harris the younger, trading in partnership as timber merchants, at Kilburn, under the style of George Chivers, have petitioned for the liquidation of their affairs; and Mr. Tee applied for the appointment of Mr. F. B. Smart, accountant, 53, Cannon Street, as receiver and manager of the estate, also for an injunction restraining an action at the suit of Mr. A. H. Haggis, of Brunswick Street, Blackfriars,

[April 16, 1881.
for the recovery of £90 5s. The debts were estimated at about £16,000, and the assets were:—securities, equities of redemption, £1,800; stock, plant, and utensils, £2,500; customers' debts in hand, about £500; book debts, about £200; and household furniture, £150. Evidence showed that the business was of an extensive nature, and that it would be necessary to make purchases of goods from time to time, in order to meet the requirements of the customers. Payments would also have to be made in respect of dock charges; and the appointment of a receiver and manager was requisite. In reply to Mr. Registrar Pepys, Mr. Tee said that the application was made with the concurrence of creditors; and his Honour made the desired appointment, and granted an injunction.
