At the other Frith of Forth ports the importation of pit-props has fairly set in.\nMessrs. Brownlee & Co. held a sale on Tuesday, in Springfield Street, of American timber, deals, battens, &c. There was a fair attendance, but buyers seemed to confine themselves to small purchases. The square yellow pine, which was of fine quality, fetched very good prices, ranging from 2s. 2½d. to 2s. 9d., the average being about 2s. 6½d. Quebec birch was not in demand; indeed nothing else was to be expected, seeing the large quantities that have been thrown on the market at late sales held here, though the descriptions previously offered were of inferior quality.\nA number of lots of flooring and battens were disposed of, but as they were job lots the prices need not be quoted. The auctioneer (Mr. Stewart) intimated that Messrs. Risk & Co. would now be in a position to cut for buyers, their mills having been closed for some weeks past. The following is a note of prices realized:—\nSquare yellow pine, 2s. 2½d. to 2s. 9d. per cub. ft.\nAsh 2s. 4d. to 2s. 9d. ,,\nAmerican red pine 19d. ,,\n1st yellow pine deals, 2s. 9d. ,,\n2nd ,, ,, 1s. 3d. ,,\n3rd ,, ,, 1s. 0½d. ,,\n9 x 4 red deals 3d. per lin. ft.\n6½ x 2½ white battens 1 7/8d. ,,\nEPPS'S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.—\"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately-flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.\"—Civil Service Gazette.
