Farrell\nNEW BRUNSWICK LUMBER PROSPECTS.\nThe *Industrial World* of the 31st March says that “in the course of a few weeks all the saw-mills around the mouth of the river St. John will have commenced the season’s sawing. By next week or the week following, and upon the first arrival of logs from up river, several of them will be running. When so many men were going to the woods last fall there was a prospect of a very heavy season’s sawing this year, but the state of the English and American markets is not nearly so reassuring now as then, and the bright prospect of last autumn has become considerably shaded. The spring season having commenced a month earlier than usual, the lumbermen have had a shorter time in the woods than was anticipated they would, and consequently the number of trees felled is not nearly as large as anticipated. The present indications are that the freshet will not be so good for bringing the logs down as would be desired. Still there seems no reason to doubt but a very much larger amount of lumber will be cut during the coming season than was sawed last year, and more than for several years past.”\nThe *St. John, N.B., News* says :—“ It requires little acquaintance with the merchants and business men about town to see that more than ordinary preparations are being made for the lumbering season. Vessels about the harbour are being cleared for action, and the mills are fast getting in readiness for business. Some of them have already started, and others will commence work in a very few days. Efforts are being made by lumber operators and agents to show that by reason of the early spring not nearly so much lumber will be got out of the streams as was at first expected. This is done, of course, with a view to affect the rates of sawing and shipping. It is probable that a large percentage of the lumber cut in the woods will not be got to the market, as the continued thaw of the last fortnight will reduce the volume of the freshet.\n“ The business in the English market has continued quiet; there has been a visible increase in the quantity of orders on the market, though they have been, as far as New Brunswick is concerned, more numerous than large. The term of last season’s shipments of deals is over, and prices at Liverpool have dropped until they cannot be expected to go lower, as all the yarded stock was imported at higher rates than those now current. Producers here must be prepared to suffer a still further reduction if they persist, in the face of the large stocks in the old country, in getting out large quantities of logs for deal cutting. Freights will, in all probability, rule low for the opening of navigation here. The common qualities of yellow pine timber, say from good fair average and downwards, are becoming year by year less in quantity and much less valuable than formerly, owing to the competition they meet with in pitch pine, as the latter can be obtained not only of longer lengths and better sizes even in sawn timber, but, what is nowadays of greater importance, at a much lower rate than is asked for the Canadian product. Last fall, when lumber was bringing in a good price, it was thought that during the coming season there would be a general rush for the woods. It was also predicted that, in consequence of the immense cut, lumber would sell at ruinous prices in the spring, and many of the operators would suffer financially. On the upper St. John, however, this is wide of the mark, for it is estimated that the amount of logs cut on the Aroostook and Tobique, and the small streams, will not exceed 25,000,000 ft. It is impossible, however, to figure the supply at market this spring from the cut in the woods, as the drives may be hung up, as they often have been, and possibly leave a not over large supply available.”\n\nLEGAL INTELLIGENCE.\nCRIPPS *v.* HOAR.\nThe following is an extract from the award of Mr. Ambrose Parsons, the referee appointed by the court to determine the amount to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff in this cause:—\n“That I have taken an account of the net profits of the said business up to the 30th September, 1879, and have fixed the price at which the defendant is to be charged for the stock that remained unsold on that date, and I have included such price as a receipt in taking the said account, and I find the net profits of the said business amount to the sum of £2,214 16s. 2d.\n“That it appears by the certificate of Master Bloxam, dated the 23rd and filed the 26th day of April, 1881, that the costs directed by the said order to be taxed and paid and retained by the defendant out of the said profits have been by the said Master taxed at the sum of £413 14s. 8d., which sum being taken from the said sum of £2,214 16s. 2d., the amount of the said net profits, there remained the sum of £1,801 1s. 6d. to be divided pursuant to the said order into two equal parts.\n“That I have divided the last-mentioned sum into two equal parts, each of such parts amounting to £900 10s. 9d. That the sums which have been paid to the plaintiff for salary amounted to £175, which being deducted from the sum of £900 10s. 9d., one of the said equal parts, I find and hereby certify that the balance of such part to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff is £725 10s. 9d. and no more.”\nBOULT *v.* LITTLEWOOD & BROWN.\nAt the Great Yarmouth Petty Sessions, Mr. Littlewood, French Consul for Great Yarmouth, was summoned for damage done to a rabbit warren, at Winterton, the property of Mr. Boult. Mr. W. P. Brown, of Gorleston, was summoned for a similar offence, and both cases were heard at the same time. Mr. C. H. Wiltshire appeared for the complainant, and Mr. J. S. Clowes represented both defendants. The effect of the complaint was that Mr. Boult was the owner of certain sand hills near the beach, at Winterton, where was situated the rabbit warren referred to in the information. On the 18th of January last, during the heavy gale, two foreign vessels, named *Anna Catherina* and *Gyda*, went on shore opposite complainant’s property, and the defendants received instructions to do their best to save the vessels’ cargo, consisting of timber. A number of beachmen were employed for this purpose, and having succeeded in securing the cargo it was stowed on complainant’s land, and in consequence of the very large number of people always on the warren the rabbits diminished. Mr. Boult had a watch kept over the grounds, but the rabbits continued to diminish, and traps were set to catch them, but even of these were stolen by the men. Complainant then ordered all the rabbits in the warren to be captured, and 400 were taken, and these he estimated would, had they not been disturbed, have bred over 2,000. The defence was that the damage was done not by the beachmen employed by the defendants, but by other persons who thronged to the spot through curiosity to see the vessels. The magistrates, after a very long hearing, awarded the complainant £85 for the damage his property had sustained.\n[A correspondent has written to us in reference to the above case, asking us to expose what he styles “an abominable imposition on the unfortunate foreigner,” but, inasmuch as the case appears to be a simple one of compensation for damage, which was not apparently denied in evidence, we do not feel ourselves called upon to do more than print the above condensed report.—ED.]\nFATALITY IN DEAN FOREST.—On the 23rd ult. an inquest was held at Lea Bailly, near Ross, on the body of James Tranter, who was killed under singular circumstances. It seems that deceased was engaged with George Robbins in felling timber at Hope Mansel. A tree had been cut down, when Robbins cut one of the limbs off; deceased was near the trunk, which rolled over and killed him on the spot.",
