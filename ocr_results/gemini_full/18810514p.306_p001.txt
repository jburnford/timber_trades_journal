TRADE ITEMS.
[The Editor will be glad to receive for insertion in this column any items of general trade interest.]

ALLEGED ARSON BY A WHEELWRIGHT.—At the Bootle Police Court, on the 3rd inst., Mr. Joseph Williams, wheelwright, Bank Road, was brought up in custody charged with having wilfully set fire to his workshop in Church View on the night of the 23rd April, 1880, with intent to defraud the Manufacturers' Insurance Company, London, of about £900.
The Bench remanded the case, agreeing to accept two sureties of £150 each for Mr. Williams's appearance and himself in £300.

BOSTON DOCK.—The Boston Dock Bill, promoted by the Corporation of Boston, passed the standing orders of the House of Commons on the 28th ult.

THE CLYDE SHIP JOINERS' STRIKE.—Great satisfaction is experienced owing to the fact that the strike of Clyde ship joiners, which has lasted a fortnight has terminated, the employers having granted the men's demands of an increase of 7½ per cent. on their present rate of wages, which is 6½d. per hour.

FATAL RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT AT SUNDERLAND.—Thomas Gilroy (40) has died in the workhouse from a broken spine, the result of an accident in Messrs. Thompson's timber yard at the South Dock in September last.
It was shown at the inquest on Monday that a large portion of a stack of timber had been thrown down through the negligence of deceased in casting a deal upon it; and the jury returned a verdict of "Accidental death."

FATALITY.—Mr. Jepson, of the firm of John & Jepson, building contractors, was recently drowned at Ely.
He had gone there in a cab from Cardiff to inspect some work, leaving the vehicle.
He was absent a long time, and was eventually found drowned in the river, into which he had evidently fallen.

SALE OF SALVAGE CARGO.—On the 6th inst. Messrs. Flick & Son held a sale at Aldeburgh-on-Sea of about 4,000 3 x 9 redwood deals salved from the barque Admete.
There was a good attendance, and the deals realized from £3 15s. to £4 per lot of 50, or about 1¾d. per foot run.

HONOURS AT THE MELBOURNE EXHIBITION.—Messrs. Thomas Robinson & Son, Limited, Railway Works, Rochdale, inform us that they have learnt by telegram from Melbourne that, in addition to the three highest awards already granted them at the Exhibition there, they have been awarded on the special recommendation of the jurors the Commissioners' Gold Medal, for the superiority of their exhibits of steam engines and wood-cutting machinery, over others of the same class.

ACCIDENT.—Geo. Beauchamp and John James Emblin, carmen, in the employ of Messrs. Arnold, timber merchants, Woolwich, were charged on remand, before the Woolwich Police Court, on Wednesday last, with causing the death of a little boy named William Archer, aged six years.
Inspector Ahern now informed the magistrate that an inquest had been held, and a verdict of accidental death returned.
The evidence showed that the deceased was seen to be swinging from the beam underneath the timber carriage which the defendants were driving in Powis Street, Woolwich, and that in getting down he fell under the rear wheel, which passed over his head, killing him instantaneously.
Mr. Balguy said he was satisfied that there was no blame whatever attributable to the defendants, and discharged them.
