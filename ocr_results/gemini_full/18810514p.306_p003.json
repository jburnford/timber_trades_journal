Temple, master of the barque *Mary Graham*, of Maryport, bound from Pensacola to Hull with a cargo of pitch pine.\nThe barque, it appears, left Florida towards the close of March, and when about 300 miles west of the Azores the large amount of water which washed over the deck lifted some of the heavy timber forming the deck cargo of the vessel, and the logs which were thus set adrift became dangerous to the ship and crew.\nWhilst the officers and crew were securing the deck cargo a heavy sea washed a large log along the deck, and it struck with violence the captain and five or six of the crew.\nThe captain's right leg was broken and he and the other men were much bruised, two of them remaining off duty for ten or twelve days.\nOn the ninth day after the accident the steamship *Lessing* was signalled, and Captain Temple was transferred on board, where he received medical attention.\nThe *Mary Graham* held on her course, and reached Hull in charge of the mate in about five days from speaking the *Lessing*.\nThe deceased was 27 years of age, and has two senior brothers who are in\n\n[MAY 14, 1881.\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nF.
