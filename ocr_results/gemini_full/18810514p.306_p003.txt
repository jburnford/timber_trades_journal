SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
FREIGHTS.
The *Newcastle Chronicle* says that the engagements entered into last week for sailing ships to bring timber from the Baltic have only been few.
Of course for the first loading, requirements have been very well met, and the bulk of the cargoes coming to hand at present are carried by vessels which have been out in the country the whole of the winter.
The ordinary spring fleet of Tyne and Blyth vessels, which at one time was a great feature at the opening of the Baltic trade, has now become of very limited dimensions.

CASUALTIES.
A telegram received from New York announces the arrival there of the steamship *Lessing* which reports the death of Captain Wm. Temple, master of the barque *Mary Graham*, of Maryport, bound from Pensacola to Hull with a cargo of pitch pine.
The barque, it appears, left Florida towards the close of March, and when about 300 miles west of the Azores the large amount of water which washed over the deck lifted some of the heavy timber forming the deck cargo of the vessel, and the logs which were thus set adrift became dangerous to the ship and crew.
Whilst the officers and crew were securing the deck cargo a heavy sea washed a large log along the deck, and it struck with violence the captain and five or six of the crew.
The captain's right leg was broken and he and the other men were much bruised, two of them remaining off duty for ten or twelve days.
On the ninth day after the accident the steamship *Lessing* was signalled, and Captain Temple was transferred on board, where he received medical attention.
The *Mary Graham* held on her course, and reached Hull in charge of the mate in about five days from speaking the *Lessing*.
The deceased was 27 years of age, and has two senior brothers who are in

EFFECT OF SNOWSTORM ON TREES.—The making up into faggots and cordwood of the fall of wood in the park at Cobham, of the Earl of Darnley, caused by the snowstorm when the trees were in full leaf, is completed, and the result is that upwards of 30,000 faggots and 300 cord have been collected, thus showing the great damage done, some of which have entirely lost their beauty.
THROAT IRRITATION.—Soreness and dryness, tickling and irritation, inducing cough and affecting the voice.
For these symptoms use Epps's Glycerine Jujubes.
Glycerine, in these agreeable confections, being in proximity to the glands at the moment they are excited by the act of sucking, becomes actively healing.
Sold only in boxes, 7 1/2d. and 1s. 1 1/2d., labelled "JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London."
A letter received: "Gentlemen,—It may, perhaps, interest you to know that, after an extended trial, I have found your Glycerine Jujubes of considerable benefit (with or without medical treatment) in almost all forms of throat disease.
They soften and clear the voice.
In no case can they do any harm.—Yours faithfully, GORDON HOLMES, L.R.C.P.E., Senior Physician to the Municipal Throat and Ear Infirmary."—*Advt.*
