Mr. Chapleau at his office, in this city, recently, in reference to the proposed increase in the timber tariff in the Province of Quebec. The deputation was composed of Messrs. Alonzo Wright, M.P., John Rochester, M.P., John Pouporo, M.P., Peter White, M.P., Col. Allan Gilmour, J. K. Ward, Mackey, and several others. The timber dues heretofore have been levied upon each saw log according to its dimensions, and the tariff has been for every log 13½ ft. long and 16 in. in diameter and under 10 cents, and for every log of 13½ ft. in length and 17 in. and over in diameter, 15 cents. To this rate the lumber dealers never objected, but by a recent order in council it appears that the Government propose to increase the tariff very greatly. It is now proposed to levy a tax of 12½ cents upon the smaller class of logs, and 26 cents on the larger. This rate the lumbermen consider exorbitant, and ask that the dues be levied in the same manner as in Ontario, viz., that each log be taxed in proportion to its contents, superficial or board measure. In Ontario the tariff is 75 cents upon every thousand feet, and this mode of levying duties is found much more equitable for all concerned. The lumbermen ask for a reduction in the proposed duties, as they consider that to put such a tariff in force as proposed would seriously hamper the whole lumbering business of the Province, and result in a great waste of timber, and calculate that under the proposed tariff, instead of 75 cents per thousand as in Ontario, the duty in Quebec would amount to about 1.50 dols. per thousand feet. The Premier, in reply, informed the deputation that the Province was sadly in need of an increased revenue, and that other sources of revenue being almost exhausted, it had been decided to increase the timber dues, but he would bring the matter before his colleagues in the Government, with the recommendation that the Ontario system of levying dues be adopted.—*Montreal 'Witness'*.\n\nWOODEN IDOLS.—From that portion of the Apocrypha known as the “Wisdom of Solomon,” the following quaint extract is made:—Now a carpenter that felleth timber, after he hath sawn down a tree meet for the purpose, and taken off all the bark skilfully round about, and hath wrought it handsomely, and make a vessel thereof fit for the service of man’s life. And after spending the refuse of his work to dress his meat, bath filled himself. And taking the very refuse among those which served to no use, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, hath carved it diligently, when he had nothing else to do, and formed it by the skill of his understanding, and fashioned it to the image of a man, or made it like some vile beast, laying it over with vermillion, and with paint, colouring it red; and when he had made a convenient room for it, set it on a wall, and made it fast with iron; for he provided for it that it might not fall, knowing that it was unable to keep itself, for it is an image, and hath need of help. Then maketh he prayer for his goods, for his wife and children, and is not ashamed to speak to that which hath no life. Again one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood (an image) more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him. And verily desire of gain devised that (the ship), and the workman built it by his skill; therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved. For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by the hand, escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation. For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh. But that which is made with hands (the image) is cursed, as well it as he that made it; he because he made, and it because being corruptible it was called god.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
