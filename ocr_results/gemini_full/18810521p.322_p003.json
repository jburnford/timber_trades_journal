M. THOMPSON.\nAt the Cardiff County Court, recently, judg-\nment was given on a claim made by the Copen-\nhagen Shipowners' Company, against\nMatthew Thompson, Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff,\nfor £46 11s., being seven days' demurrage of the\nvessel Signe (399 tons), at 4d. per ton per day.\nMr. Downing represented the plaintiffs, and Mr.\nVachell the defendant. His Honour said this was\nan action for demurrage brought by the owners of\nthe ship Signe against the defendant as consignee\nand holder of the bill of lading. The charter-\nparty, dated 27th January, 1880, was between\nthe agents of the owners and the shipper, J. M. H.\nLanglois, whereby it was agreed that the ship\nshould proceed to Bordeaux, and there load a cargo\nof pitwood, then proceed to Cardiff, into such\ndock as might be ordered on arrival, and there\ndeliver the same, &c., cargo to be discharged at\nthe rate of 40 tons per day. The bill of lading\nmade the cargo deliverable to M. Thompson on\norder, and was endorsed.\nIt was proved that no property ever passed to the defendant; he was\nmerely as agent for the shipper, and sold the cargo\nto Messrs. Coffin & Co., and endorsed the bill\nof lading and delivered it to Messrs. Coffin & Co.,\nwho, when the vessel arrived, paid the freight\nthrough Mr. Thompson to Messrs. Parry & Co.\nwith their own cheque. Messrs. Parry & Co.\nmade out the bill for the weights against Mr.\nThompson, struck out his name, and substituted\nfor it the name \"Messrs. Coffin & Co.,\" when they\nreceived the freight. The alteration was made\nwith the knowledge of the master. It was there-\nfore known to the master and to the ship's agents\nthat the defendant had signed the charter-party as\nagent for the shipper—that Messrs. Coffin & Co.\nhad received the cargo, had the property in it, and\nhad the bill of lading which was endorsed by Mr.\nLanglois, on seeing which they must have con-\ncluded that the defendant, though the nominal con-\nsignee, was really nothing more than the agent of\nMr. Langlois. Mr. Downing had contended for the\nplaintiffs that the defendant being named in the\nbill of lading as the consignee was liable for de-\nmurrage, resting his case on the 1st section of the\nBills of Lading Act. Mr. Vachell, for the defendant,\nmaintained that as the defendant had any\nproperty in the cargo, nor received it, but that as the\nproperty passed direct from the shippers to Messrs.\nCoffin & Co., who received it, the defendant was in\nno way liable, and he (the judge) was of that\nopinion. This appeared to him to follow the very\nwords of the Act. A consignee to whom the\nproperty in the goods was not liable, though if he\nreceived the goods he made himself liable, as at\ncommon law in an implied contract to pay the\nfreight. He therefore gave judgment for the de-\nfendant.\n\nBARNES v. BAKER.\nIn the Bristol County Court on Tuesday an\naction was brought by Horace Thomas Barnes\nagainst John Baker (trading as Baker & Co.),\ntimber merchant, Bristol, to recover damages for\nwrongful dismissal, and for the balance of salary\nbefore his expiration of service. Two or three\nyears ago plaintiff entered defendant's service, the\nname of the firm being then Barnes & Baker—at\na salary of £200 a year, which was subsequently\nincreased to £250 per annum, first as traveller,\nand then in the office. On December 21st plain-\ntiff gave notice of his intention to leave on March\n25th. On December 13th defendant and plain-\ntiff's father, Mr. Thomas Barnes, agreed to dissolve\npartnership as from December 2nd. On February\n16th Mr. Baker issued a circular to his customers\nannouncing the dissolution, and his intention to\ncarry on business as J. A. Baker & Co. Mr. Barnes,\nsen., who, in the deed of dissolution, undertook\nto remain as manager till March 31st, considered\nthis an improper proceeding, and by way of\nreprisal issued a circular stating that from March\n26th he and his son would carry on business at\nCanon's Marsh. On March 14th the defendant\n\ndischarged the plaintiff without giving any reason,\nbut now justified it. He paid his salary up to\ndate of dismissal, the cause of which seemed to\nbe that on March 3rd Mr. Barnes, sen., received a\nletter from a former customer asking for prices of\ngoods delivered at Morthoe. Mr. Barnes, sen.,\nhanded the circular to his son, a pro forma invoice\nfor the customer, and the plaintiff copied it. The\nquestion was whether this sufficiently justified the\ndismissal without notice. The defendant's traveller\nafterwards called on the customer, and obtained\nthe order. For the defendant it was contended\nthat the dismissal was justified on the ground that\nthe plaintiff concerted with his father, also a\nservant of the defendant, in an act injurious to the\nbusiness. The judge (Mr. W. J. Metcalfe, Q.C.)\nremarked that Mr. Barnes, sen., had covenanted\nto devote himself entirely to the defendant's\nbusiness till March 31st, and no manager or clerk\nhad any right to send circulars to his employer's\ncustomers announcing an intention to set up an\nopposition business. There was abundant justifi-\ncation for the dismissal, and he gave judgment for\nthe defendant.\n\nMR. LASCELLES' WORKS.\nTHE visit paid recently by the Architectural\nAssociation to the workshops of Mr. W. H.\nLascelles, in Bunhill Row, says the Building\nNews, was both of an instructive and interesting\nkind, for the members had an opportunity, not\nonly of witnessing the operation of many very\ningenious wood-working machines, but of examin-\ning specimens of finished joinery and various\napplications of Mr. Lascelles' red concrete, a\nmaterial which seems destined sooner or later to\ntake its place among the more durable substances\nthe architect can employ. Commencing on the\nground-floor of the factory, each successive floor\nof Mr. Lascelles' extensive building was taken in\norder. The moulding cutting machine attracted\nconsiderable attention. Pieces of rosewood were\npassed through the machine, and came out deli-\ncately moulded with ogees, hollows, and fillets of\nremarkable sharpness. The machine is by\nRobinson, of Rochdale. Another specimen of\nmoulded work was a cornice in a beautiful yellow\nCanadian wood, the members of which were\nsingularly clean. To show the value of machine\nlabour in performing operations requiring\nmechanical exactness, some lengths of\nschool-desk were drilled by holes for the ink-\nbottles, and their ends cleanly cut to a certain\nlength by a cross-cutting and boring machine\nadapted by Mr. Lascelles, in which the chief pecu-\nliarity is the form of the teeth of the circular\nsaw. Every tooth in the wheel is cut in the form\nof a lancet, and these are arranged on the oppo-\nsite faces of the metal alternately, the effect of\nwhich is that the wood cut through has all the\ncleanness, finish, and polish of a planed piece of\nwork. Another very ingenious little rotary ma-\nchine was set to work in mouldings sunk from\nthe surface of the wood. This is chiefly employed\nin working circular countersunk mouldings. A\nvery fine delicate moulding was turned out in ma-\nhogany, all that was required being resting the\npiece of wood on a table, and pressing it by the\nhand against a circular band which can be raised\nor lowered, and within which is a rapidly-revolv-\ning spindle, with the tools fixed in it. By this\nmeans the manipulator can run a moulding on a\npiece of wood of any curvature or degree of\nstraightness; but its chief use is obviously for cir-\ncular work.\nThe American system of drying timber is used\nby Mr. Lascelles, the principal feature of which is\nthat there is no outlet, the room being quite air-\ntight, and the vapour being condensed on a series\nof cold water pipes. It is an excellent plan of\ndrying. Proceeding to the first floor, chiefly occu-\npied in glazing and in packing, the process of\nbending ribs for horticultural roofs was seen; the\nmoulded rib having been placed in a long steam-\npipe, and kept in it for twenty minutes, was\nquickly pulled out and bent round a large hori-\nzontally-placed template or frame of timber, and\nkept in position by a radial clip. In this manner\nthe pieces composing the bar or rib were glued\nand nailed together, and when taken off it\nwas found to be perfect in form. On the\nsecond floor a door-cramp that had been in use\nfifteen years, and an American sawing machine,\nwhich in its work leaves the wood like a plane,\nand a grooving and rebating machine were in-\nspected. A very cheap kind of panelled oak dado,\nby Mr. Cousens Smith, is formed of matchboards\nbehind, faced with a veneer on which are planted\nmoulded pieces with bosses at the corners. It is\nequally adapted for ceilings. On the third floor\nvarious specimens of joinery drew attention,\nexcellent examples of clean-finished work. The\ndoors and other framed work for a house at\nQueen's Gate were examined with some interest,\nof which the dado architraves form a capital finish\nfor the members of the dado cornice. A summer\nhouse, executed with open framing filling-in, a\nsort of Japanese trellis, some cheap and effective\n\npicture frames, machine-made, and a garden\nshelter, like a huge umbrella, which can be opened\nand closed, drew attention. On the upper floor a\nnumber of London School Board desks, with the\nfront part of desk made hinged so as to fold back\nwhen not in use, was one of the chief works\nexamined, and Mr. Lascelles has been probably\nthe largest manufacturer of these desks. The\nvalue of machinery in the production of park seats\nwas clearly seen, as the laths can be cut to\nform the rounded seat and back.\n\nTHE LONDON WOOD BROKERS'\nCIRCULARS.\nMESSRS. CHURCHILL & SIM state that the late\nopening of the navigation in the North of Europe\nhas been very much in favour of the holders of\nwood in London, and during the month of April\nconsiderable quantities have been realized by un-\nreserved auction sales without further reduction of\nprice. The extent to which country buyers have\navailed themselves of these sales is shown by the\nunexampled delivery in one week of 7,250 loads\nof deals, battens, and boards, of which\none-half was taken away by railway.\nDuring the past month there has been no dispo-\nsition on the part of the dealers, whether in London\nor outports, to enter into any engagements for the\nimportation of wood. The prospects for the general\ntrade of the country seem so gloomy that the trade\nhave preferred to supply themselves from stocks\nhere for present use, and to take the chance of the\nmarket for future requirements.\nThe importation of flooring is so moderate that\nif consumption continues on anything like the\nsame scale as in previous months the stock will\nsoon be reduced to very small compass and fair\nprices may be expected. At auction prices have\nbeen well sustained. Of battens the import has\nbeen more extensive, but they have been in fair\ndemand.\nThe old stocks of Swedish deals and battens have\nhave been selling at auction at about the rates\nof a very small profit on the auction prices.\nQuotations being less than the import cost of\nnew arrivals, the trade seem determined to see the\nstocks here much more reduced before making\nfresh purchases.\nSTAVES.—The market remains in statu quo,\nawaiting the arrival of fresh importations from the\nBaltic and Canada. Dock stocks are low, and the\nfew retail sales recorded during the month indicate\nfirmness in prices. The work for which Bosnian\nis required is finished for this season, so the stock\nof £300,000 will have to await autumn contracts.\nSome of the old though good West India puncheon have\nbeen sold at £20, and some inferior at £17 10s.\nStocks are now very light. American staves con-\ntinue in fair demand.\n\nMESSRS. SIMSON & MASON say that the London\nmarket has shown no material alteration during\nthe past month, and although the deliveries from\nthe docks have largely increased, this has been in\na great measure the result of the recent heavy\nauction sales being principally to country and\nexport buyers. The dealers here report business\nas excessively dull, and some failures among the\nbuilders in London and its suburbs have tended to\ndepress the trade and made buyers more disinclined to\noperate freely. The unusually late opening of the\nnavigation in the North of Europe, while giving a\nlonger time for holders to realize, has not had the\neffect of causing any improvement in values.\nFair sales continue to be made on the coast, and\na considerable business has now been done in this\nway, but hardly up to the average of the last few\nseasons.\n\nA SUMPTUOUS RESIDENCE.—The most costly\nhouse in New York will be that of Mr. Vander-\nbilt, who is only outdone in magnificence through-\nout the States by the Bonanza King in the Far\nWest. The house, together with two other ad-\njoining, which Mr. Vanderbilt is constructing for\nhis daughters, will cost some £300,000. The\nwoodwork is to be \"chosen from the choice woods\nof the world,\" and is to be fashioned by the\n\"most skilful European and American carvers.\"\nEPPS'S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.\n—\"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws\nwhich govern the operations of digestion and nutri-\ntion, and by a careful application of the fine proper-\nties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided\nour breakfast tables with a delicately-flavoured\nbeverage which may save us many heavy doctors'\nbills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of\ndiet that a constitution may be gradually built up\nuntil strong enough to resist every tendency to dis-\nease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating\naround us ready to attack wherever there is a weak\npoint. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keep-\ning ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a\nproperly nourished frame.\"—Civil Service Gazette.\nSold only in Packets labelled—\"JAMES EPPS & Co.,\nHomœopathic Chemists, London.\"—Also makers of\nEpps's Chocolate Essence for afternoon use.—Advt.",
