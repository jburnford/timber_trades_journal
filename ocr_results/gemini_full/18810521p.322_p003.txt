LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
COPENHAGEN SHIPOWNERS' COMPANY
v. M. THOMPSON.
At the Cardiff County Court, recently, judg-
ment was given on a claim made by the Copen-
hagen Shipowners' Company, against
Matthew Thompson, Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff,
for £46 11s., being seven days' demurrage of the
vessel Signe (399 tons), at 4d. per ton per day.
Mr. Downing represented the plaintiffs, and Mr.
Vachell the defendant. His Honour said this was
an action for demurrage brought by the owners of
the ship Signe against the defendant as consignee
and holder of the bill of lading. The charter-
party, dated 27th January, 1880, was between
the agents of the owners and the shipper, J. M. H.
Langlois, whereby it was agreed that the ship
should proceed to Bordeaux, and there load a cargo
of pitwood, then proceed to Cardiff, into such
dock as might be ordered on arrival, and there
deliver the same, &c., cargo to be discharged at
the rate of 40 tons per day. The bill of lading
made the cargo deliverable to M. Thompson on
order, and was endorsed.
It was proved that no property ever passed to the defendant; he was
merely as agent for the shipper, and sold the cargo
to Messrs. Coffin & Co., and endorsed the bill
of lading and delivered it to Messrs. Coffin & Co.,
who, when the vessel arrived, paid the freight
through Mr. Thompson to Messrs. Parry & Co.
with their own cheque. Messrs. Parry & Co.
made out the bill for the weights against Mr.
Thompson, struck out his name, and substituted
for it the name "Messrs. Coffin & Co.," when they
received the freight. The alteration was made
with the knowledge of the master. It was there-
fore known to the master and to the ship's agents
that the defendant had signed the charter-party as
agent for the shipper—that Messrs. Coffin & Co.
had received the cargo, had the property in it, and
had the bill of lading which was endorsed by Mr.
Langlois, on seeing which they must have con-
cluded that the defendant, though the nominal con-
signee, was really nothing more than the agent of
Mr. Langlois. Mr. Downing had contended for the
plaintiffs that the defendant being named in the
bill of lading as the consignee was liable for de-
murrage, resting his case on the 1st section of the
Bills of Lading Act. Mr. Vachell, for the defendant,
maintained that as the defendant had any
property in the cargo, nor received it, but that as the
property passed direct from the shippers to Messrs.
Coffin & Co., who received it, the defendant was in
no way liable, and he (the judge) was of that
opinion. This appeared to him to follow the very
words of the Act. A consignee to whom the
property in the goods was not liable, though if he
received the goods he made himself liable, as at
common law in an implied contract to pay the
freight. He therefore gave judgment for the de-
fendant.

BARNES v. BAKER.
In the Bristol County Court on Tuesday an
action was brought by Horace Thomas Barnes
against John Baker (trading as Baker & Co.),
timber merchant, Bristol, to recover damages for
wrongful dismissal, and for the balance of salary
before his expiration of service. Two or three
years ago plaintiff entered defendant's service, the
name of the firm being then Barnes & Baker—at
a salary of £200 a year, which was subsequently
increased to £250 per annum, first as traveller,
and then in the office. On December 21st plain-
tiff gave notice of his intention to leave on March
25th. On December 13th defendant and plain-
tiff's father, Mr. Thomas Barnes, agreed to dissolve
partnership as from December 2nd. On February
16th Mr. Baker issued a circular to his customers
announcing the dissolution, and his intention to
carry on business as J. A. Baker & Co. Mr. Barnes,
sen., who, in the deed of dissolution, undertook
to remain as manager till March 31st, considered
this an improper proceeding, and by way of
reprisal issued a circular stating that from March
26th he and his son would carry on business at
Canon's Marsh. On March 14th the defendant

discharged the plaintiff without giving any reason,
but now justified it. He paid his salary up to
date of dismissal, the cause of which seemed to
be that on March 3rd Mr. Barnes, sen., received a
letter from a former customer asking for prices of
goods delivered at Morthoe. Mr. Barnes, sen.,
handed the circular to his son, a pro forma invoice
for the customer, and the plaintiff copied it. The
question was whether this sufficiently justified the
dismissal without notice. The defendant's traveller
afterwards called on the customer, and obtained
the order. For the defendant it was contended
that the dismissal was justified on the ground that
the plaintiff concerted with his father, also a
servant of the defendant, in an act injurious to the
business. The judge (Mr. W. J. Metcalfe, Q.C.)
remarked that Mr. Barnes, sen., had covenanted
to devote himself entirely to the defendant's
business till March 31st, and no manager or clerk
had any right to send circulars to his employer's
customers announcing an intention to set up an
opposition business. There was abundant justifi-
cation for the dismissal, and he gave judgment for
the defendant.

MR. LASCELLES' WORKS.
THE visit paid recently by the Architectural
Association to the workshops of Mr. W. H.
Lascelles, in Bunhill Row, says the Building
News, was both of an instructive and interesting
kind, for the members had an opportunity, not
only of witnessing the operation of many very
ingenious wood-working machines, but of examin-
ing specimens of finished joinery and various
applications of Mr. Lascelles' red concrete, a
material which seems destined sooner or later to
take its place among the more durable substances
the architect can employ. Commencing on the
ground-floor of the factory, each successive floor
of Mr. Lascelles' extensive building was taken in
order. The moulding cutting machine attracted
considerable attention. Pieces of rosewood were
passed through the machine, and came out deli-
cately moulded with ogees, hollows, and fillets of
remarkable sharpness. The machine is by
Robinson, of Rochdale. Another specimen of
moulded work was a cornice in a beautiful yellow
Canadian wood, the members of which were
singularly clean. To show the value of machine
labour in performing operations requiring
mechanical exactness, some lengths of
school-desk were drilled by holes for the ink-
bottles, and their ends cleanly cut to a certain
length by a cross-cutting and boring machine
adapted by Mr. Lascelles, in which the chief pecu-
liarity is the form of the teeth of the circular
saw. Every tooth in the wheel is cut in the form
of a lancet, and these are arranged on the oppo-
site faces of the metal alternately, the effect of
which is that the wood cut through has all the
cleanness, finish, and polish of a planed piece of
work. Another very ingenious little rotary ma-
chine was set to work in mouldings sunk from
the surface of the wood. This is chiefly employed
in working circular countersunk mouldings. A
very fine delicate moulding was turned out in ma-
hogany, all that was required being resting the
piece of wood on a table, and pressing it by the
hand against a circular band which can be raised
or lowered, and within which is a rapidly-revolv-
ing spindle, with the tools fixed in it. By this
means the manipulator can run a moulding on a
piece of wood of any curvature or degree of
straightness; but its chief use is obviously for cir-
cular work.
The American system of drying timber is used
by Mr. Lascelles, the principal feature of which is
that there is no outlet, the room being quite air-
tight, and the vapour being condensed on a series
of cold water pipes. It is an excellent plan of
drying. Proceeding to the first floor, chiefly occu-
pied in glazing and in packing, the process of
bending ribs for horticultural roofs was seen; the
moulded rib having been placed in a long steam-
pipe, and kept in it for twenty minutes, was
quickly pulled out and bent round a large hori-
zontally-placed template or frame of timber, and
kept in position by a radial clip. In this manner
the pieces composing the bar or rib were glued
and nailed together, and when taken off it
was found to be perfect in form. On the
second floor a door-cramp that had been in use
fifteen years, and an American sawing machine,
which in its work leaves the wood like a plane,
and a grooving and rebating machine were in-
spected. A very cheap kind of panelled oak dado,
by Mr. Cousens Smith, is formed of matchboards
behind, faced with a veneer on which are planted
moulded pieces with bosses at the corners. It is
equally adapted for ceilings. On the third floor
various specimens of joinery drew attention,
excellent examples of clean-finished work. The
doors and other framed work for a house at
Queen's Gate were examined with some interest,
of which the dado architraves form a capital finish
for the members of the dado cornice. A summer
house, executed with open framing filling-in, a
sort of Japanese trellis, some cheap and effective

picture frames, machine-made, and a garden
shelter, like a huge umbrella, which can be opened
and closed, drew attention. On the upper floor a
number of London School Board desks, with the
front part of desk made hinged so as to fold back
when not in use, was one of the chief works
examined, and Mr. Lascelles has been probably
the largest manufacturer of these desks. The
value of machinery in the production of park seats
was clearly seen, as the laths can be cut to
form the rounded seat and back.

THE LONDON WOOD BROKERS'
CIRCULARS.
MESSRS. CHURCHILL & SIM state that the late
opening of the navigation in the North of Europe
has been very much in favour of the holders of
wood in London, and during the month of April
considerable quantities have been realized by un-
reserved auction sales without further reduction of
price. The extent to which country buyers have
availed themselves of these sales is shown by the
unexampled delivery in one week of 7,250 loads
of deals, battens, and boards, of which
one-half was taken away by railway.
During the past month there has been no dispo-
sition on the part of the dealers, whether in London
or outports, to enter into any engagements for the
importation of wood. The prospects for the general
trade of the country seem so gloomy that the trade
have preferred to supply themselves from stocks
here for present use, and to take the chance of the
market for future requirements.
The importation of flooring is so moderate that
if consumption continues on anything like the
same scale as in previous months the stock will
soon be reduced to very small compass and fair
prices may be expected. At auction prices have
been well sustained. Of battens the import has
been more extensive, but they have been in fair
demand.
The old stocks of Swedish deals and battens have
have been selling at auction at about the rates
of a very small profit on the auction prices.
Quotations being less than the import cost of
new arrivals, the trade seem determined to see the
stocks here much more reduced before making
fresh purchases.
STAVES.—The market remains in statu quo,
awaiting the arrival of fresh importations from the
Baltic and Canada. Dock stocks are low, and the
few retail sales recorded during the month indicate
firmness in prices. The work for which Bosnian
is required is finished for this season, so the stock
of £300,000 will have to await autumn contracts.
Some of the old though good West India puncheon have
been sold at £20, and some inferior at £17 10s.
Stocks are now very light. American staves con-
tinue in fair demand.

MESSRS. SIMSON & MASON say that the London
market has shown no material alteration during
the past month, and although the deliveries from
the docks have largely increased, this has been in
a great measure the result of the recent heavy
auction sales being principally to country and
export buyers. The dealers here report business
as excessively dull, and some failures among the
builders in London and its suburbs have tended to
depress the trade and made buyers more disinclined to
operate freely. The unusually late opening of the
navigation in the North of Europe, while giving a
longer time for holders to realize, has not had the
effect of causing any improvement in values.
Fair sales continue to be made on the coast, and
a considerable business has now been done in this
way, but hardly up to the average of the last few
seasons.

A SUMPTUOUS RESIDENCE.—The most costly
house in New York will be that of Mr. Vander-
bilt, who is only outdone in magnificence through-
out the States by the Bonanza King in the Far
West. The house, together with two other ad-
joining, which Mr. Vanderbilt is constructing for
his daughters, will cost some £300,000. The
woodwork is to be "chosen from the choice woods
of the world," and is to be fashioned by the
"most skilful European and American carvers."
EPPS'S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.
—"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws
which govern the operations of digestion and nutri-
tion, and by a careful application of the fine proper-
ties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided
our breakfast tables with a delicately-flavoured
beverage which may save us many heavy doctors'
bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of
diet that a constitution may be gradually built up
until strong enough to resist every tendency to dis-
ease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating
around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak
point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keep-
ing ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a
properly nourished frame."—Civil Service Gazette.
