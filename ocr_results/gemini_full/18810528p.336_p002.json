McEwen\n\nTHE STRIKE AT ST. JOHN, N.B.\nThe St. John Globe, of May 10th, says:-\"At\nthe Labourers' Society meeting yesterday after-\nnoon it was decided that, as shipowners were\nsuffering severely on account of the strike, they\nwould stow the deals lying beside the vessels.\nMr. Stewart had chartered, but would not load\nMr. Stewart's own vessel. The society agreed to\nfind work for the scowmen on the vessels at\n2 dols. 50 cents. per day. This agreement was\ncarried out this morning, but several of the scow-\nmen left the society and went to work with Mr.\nStewart at the old rate of wages to-day. In con-\nsequence of this the society men went to work on\nMr. Stewart's vessel the British Queen this after-\nnoon. The action of the society simply amounts\nto the throwing of the scowmen out, for they\nmust either get long-shore work at 2 dols. 50 cents.\nor leave the society and take scow-work at what-\never rate they can get.\n\"Later advices show that the stevedores endea-\nvoured to 'Boycott' Messrs. Stewart. This firm\nhas always kept faith with the labouring men in\nSt. John, and did not lower wages in the winter\nseason when work was scarce and men willing to\ntake it at low rates. Messrs. Stewart have been\nequally firm in refusing to accede to the unreason-\nable demands of strikers. In the case of the\nBritish Queen, owned by Messrs. Stewart, the\nstevedores left the loaded scows alongside at\nfreshet time, when the risk of loss was greatest\nand would fall upon the ship. But the firm\nengaged scowmen to stow the cargo, and the\nstevedores found that they were losing their\nlegitimate work and damaging the interests of the\nport. They were therefore obliged to abandon\ntheir attempt at 'Boycotting' in this instance.\"\n\nIMPROVEMENT IN PREPARING WOOD FOR\nPIANOFORTES.-It is reported that the piano\nmanufacturer, Herr Ren√©, of Stettin, has made an\nimportant discovery in his art. He has found a\nway of preparing the woods used in piano-making,\nand especially the resonance-woods, that pianos\nthus made resist all influences of temperature and\nmoisture. The tone of the instruments is said to\nsurpass that of all previous instruments in beauty\nand force, and to improve rather than deteriorate\nwith time. The method consists in subjecting\nwood to the action of pure oxygen ozonized by\npassage of the electric current and heat. It\nproves useful in the case of pianos exported to\ntropical countries, where resistance to weather\ninfluences is of great importance.\n\nWOOD FOR GUNPOWDER.-The conditions pre-\nscribed by the British Government in the manu-\nfacture of gunpowder for the public service provide,\namong other things, that the wood-dogwood-\nfor the charcoal shall be of the utmost cleanness,\nany traces of bark adhering to it constituting an\nimpurity ensuring its immediate condemnation,\nand the wood must also be cut in the spring of\nthe year. If the latter operation is performed\nwhen the sap is rising, the bark is easily removed,\nand the wood is left perfectly clean; but wood cut\nlater in the year or winter is quite as good, only in\nthis case the removal of the bark is a much more\ndifficult matter; the process of separation involves\nthe boiling of the wood, or, if this is impracti-\ncable, the whole of the bark must be shaved off\nwith a knife. The objection chiefly characterizing\nboth the boiled and shaved, for gunpowder manu-\nfacture, is that they do not keep so well when\nstacked as the spring-cut wood, going to decay\nmuch faster.\n\nSHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\nFOREIGN CLEARANCES.\nQUEBEC.-May 7th, per ship Bridgewater, for\nLiverpool, 252 pcs. oak, 195 do. red pine, 811 do.\ndo. white pine, 131 do. ash, 15,992 pine deals,\n1,964 do. ends, 7,200 WOWI staves.\nST.
