THE STRIKE AT ST. JOHN, N.B.
The St. John Globe, of May 10th, says:-"At
the Labourers' Society meeting yesterday after-
noon it was decided that, as shipowners were
suffering severely on account of the strike, they
would stow the deals lying beside the vessels.
Mr. Stewart had chartered, but would not load
Mr. Stewart's own vessel. The society agreed to
find work for the scowmen on the vessels at
2 dols. 50 cents. per day. This agreement was
carried out this morning, but several of the scow-
men left the society and went to work with Mr.
Stewart at the old rate of wages to-day. In con-
sequence of this the society men went to work on
Mr. Stewart's vessel the British Queen this after-
noon. The action of the society simply amounts
to the throwing of the scowmen out, for they
must either get long-shore work at 2 dols. 50 cents.
or leave the society and take scow-work at what-
ever rate they can get.
"Later advices show that the stevedores endea-
voured to 'Boycott' Messrs. Stewart. This firm
has always kept faith with the labouring men in
St. John, and did not lower wages in the winter
season when work was scarce and men willing to
take it at low rates. Messrs. Stewart have been
equally firm in refusing to accede to the unreason-
able demands of strikers. In the case of the
British Queen, owned by Messrs. Stewart, the
stevedores left the loaded scows alongside at
freshet time, when the risk of loss was greatest
and would fall upon the ship. But the firm
engaged scowmen to stow the cargo, and the
stevedores found that they were losing their
legitimate work and damaging the interests of the
port. They were therefore obliged to abandon
their attempt at 'Boycotting' in this instance."

IMPROVEMENT IN PREPARING WOOD FOR
PIANOFORTES.-It is reported that the piano
manufacturer, Herr Ren√©, of Stettin, has made an
important discovery in his art. He has found a
way of preparing the woods used in piano-making,
and especially the resonance-woods, that pianos
thus made resist all influences of temperature and
moisture. The tone of the instruments is said to
surpass that of all previous instruments in beauty
and force, and to improve rather than deteriorate
with time. The method consists in subjecting
wood to the action of pure oxygen ozonized by
passage of the electric current and heat. It
proves useful in the case of pianos exported to
tropical countries, where resistance to weather
influences is of great importance.

WOOD FOR GUNPOWDER.-The conditions pre-
scribed by the British Government in the manu-
facture of gunpowder for the public service provide,
among other things, that the wood-dogwood-
for the charcoal shall be of the utmost cleanness,
any traces of bark adhering to it constituting an
impurity ensuring its immediate condemnation,
and the wood must also be cut in the spring of
the year. If the latter operation is performed
when the sap is rising, the bark is easily removed,
and the wood is left perfectly clean; but wood cut
later in the year or winter is quite as good, only in
this case the removal of the bark is a much more
difficult matter; the process of separation involves
the boiling of the wood, or, if this is impracti-
cable, the whole of the bark must be shaved off
with a knife. The objection chiefly characterizing
both the boiled and shaved, for gunpowder manu-
facture, is that they do not keep so well when
stacked as the spring-cut wood, going to decay
much faster.
