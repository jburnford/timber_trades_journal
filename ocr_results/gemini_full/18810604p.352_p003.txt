THE KING OF SWEDEN.—On Friday, the 27th ult., Mr. J. Griffin, Secretary of the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, had the honour of an interview with his Majesty the King of Sweden and Norway. We understand that his Majesty, in the course of the interview, expressed his deep interest in the Swedish and Norwegian seamen trading to this port, and inquired as to the success of the Scandinavian church at Rotherhithe, the foundation stone of which was laid by his Majesty on a former visit to this country.

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
SETNA v. THOMAS WILLIAMS.
THIS was a case in the Bombay Court of Appeal, which was heard before Sir C. Sargent and Mr. Justice West on reference from the Small Cause Court, Mr. Farran, instructed by Messrs. Nanu & Hormusjee, appearing for the plaintiff, and Mr. Kirkpatrick, instructed by Messrs. Payne & Gilbert, for the defendant. The plaintiff had consigned to him from Rangoon 135 logs of timber, and the defendant was the captain of the ship Abyssinia, on which the logs were shipped.
The Small Cause suit was heard before Mr. W. E. Hart, First Judge, the plaintiff suing to recover Rs. 504-8 as an over-payment of freight under the following circumstances:—One Karaunee Veeraswamy, at Moulmein, consigned to the plaintiff in Bombay 135 logs of teak timber shipped on board the defendant's ship, and covered by a bill of lading signed by defendant. The bill of lading described the 135 logs as measuring 115 tons, and provided for the payment of freight thereon at Bombay, at the rate of Rs. 17 per ton of 50 cubic ft. on right delivery. The last clause of the bill of lading was in the handwriting of the defendant to the following effect :—" Marks, numbers, quantity, and measurement unknown, all other conditions as per charter-party." The charter-party was expressed to be between the owners of the ship and the firm of Messrs. Bhugwandas, of Rangoon, as charterers of the whole ship, and provided inter alia for the payment of freight at the rate of Rs. 18 per ton of 50 cubic ft. for all timber, one rate throughout, except 100 tons broken stowage at half freight by intake measurement. On the arrival of the ship at Bombay the plaintiff, as endorsee and holder of the bill of lading and consignee of the goods mentioned, paid the defendant Rs. 1,500 on account of the freight, and took delivery of the 135 logs. On measuring them, however, he found that according to his method of measurement, which was to measure length, breadth, and thickness of each log separately, making no deduction for holes or fractures, the total measurement of the 135 logs came to tons 58-27-11-6, and not 115 tons as mentioned in the bill of lading. He claimed, therefore, to be chargeable with freight only on the smaller quantity Rs. 995-8, and to recover from the defendant the difference between the sum on the Rs. 1,500 paid on account (Rs. 504-8) as for over-payment of freight. It was proved before his Honour the First Judge that all the timber put on board was measured by an employé of the charterers acting apparently as the agent of all the different shippers, and that the admeasurements in the bills of lading were those supplied by the person to the defendant as the measurement of the different consignments. His Honour also found as facts that the 135 logs measured by the plaintiff in Bombay were the same logs as were shipped under this bill of lading, and that his measurement of them was corrected according to the mode of measurement which he followed. There was no evidence as to what the mode of measurement followed at Moulmein was, nor, excepting the statement in the bill of lading, as to what was actually intake measurement there of this particular consignment. Neither party would apply for a commission to Moulmein for the purpose of ascertaining those particulars, of each contending that the burden of proof lay on the other. His Honour held that the effect of the last clause in the bill of lading was, 1st, to incorporate into that document the provision of the charter-party, and that freight was to be calculated on the intake measurement; 2nd, that the burden was on the plaintiff to show that the intake measurement was tons 58-27-11-6 only; and 3rd, on the authority of "Spraight v. Farnworth" (Law Reports, Queen's Bench Division, 115), that the measurement by the plaintiff in Bombay afforded no criterion as to what was the intake measurement at Moulmein. His Honour accordingly directed a nonsuit to be entered, but at the request of the plaintiff's pleader, and on condition of the plaintiff depositing in the Small Cause Court Rs. 50 to cover the costs of the reference, and Rs. 34 the certified professional costs of defendant in the case, the order for the nonsuit was made subject to the opinion of the High Court on points of law stated by the plaintiff's pleader. The points raised by the pleader were as follow :—1. Was not the burden of proving what was the intake measurement at Moulmein wrongly laid on the plaintiff, and should it not have been laid on the defendant? 2. Ought the measurement mentioned in the bill of lading to be taken to be the intake measurement at Moulmein? 3. Was not the Court in error in considering that the case of "Spraight v. Farnworth" was applicable to the present case? and 4. Inasmuch as the bill of lading contains an express provision for the payment of freight, was not the Court in error in holding that the words in the last clause, "all other conditions as per charter-party," operated to incorporate into the bill of lading the provision in the charter-party that freight was to be calculated on the intake measurement?
After hearing the arguments of counsel, their lordships confirmed the judgment of Mr. Hart, and ordered the plaintiff to pay the costs of the reference.
KARLSSON v. SMITHSON & CO.
THIS was an appeal from the decision of the learned Judge of the Hull County Court in favour of the defendants on their counter claim. The plaintiff's claim, which was admitted, was on a charter-party. The defendants for freight on a cargo of the ship Faderlandlet for freight on a winter risk. This extra sum the plaintiff was to pay to the defendants, saying that the delay in the voyage of the ship was caused by perils of the sea during the voyage. The County Court Judge found for the defendants on their counter-claim on the ground that the ship did not arrive at Archangel within a reasonable time after June 30th. A rule nisi for a new trial having been obtained on behalf of the plaintiff,
Mr. J. V. Austin now showed cause, and Mr. Witt supported the rule.
The Court held that the County Court Judge was wrong in supposing that there was any warranty that the ship should reach Archangel by or in a reasonable time after June 30th, and that the proper question of fact was whether the voyage to Honfleur was a reasonable voyage to make as an intermediate voyage before proceeding to Archangel.
The case was accordingly sent down for a new trial.
LAUVERT & HORGH v. F. HARTMAN.
AT the Goole County Court, on Tuesday, his Honour Judge Bedwell, had before him a case of considerable interest to shippers and others interested in the logwood trade. Messrs. Lauvert & Horgh, owners of the Norwegian ship Rhonda, sued Mr. F. Hartman, shipping agent, of Goole, for £12 14s., freight of logwood. The defendant paid £10 3s. 7d. into court, leaving a balance of £2 11s. in dispute. The defendant put in a set-off for that amount for damage done to the cargo. Mr. A. W. Jackson, of Hull, appeared for the plaintiffs and Mr. Tindal Atkinson, of Leeds, instructed by Messrs. Hind & Everatt, appeared for the defendant. The case was heard before a jury, of which Mr. Huntington was foreman. The plaintiffs in the case were the owners of a Norwegian ship called Rhonda. The defendant was Mr. Hartman, a logwood agent. The consignee of the cargo of logwood was a Mr. C. Diesseldorf, a shipping agent in London, but the bill of lading was transferred to Mr. Thomas Crossley, of Leeds, who became the real owner of the cargo, and who was the real defendant in the case, although Mr. Hartman, the agent in Goole, was made defender. The ship arrived in Goole. When it was taken out of the ship it was discovered that out of something like 277 tons of logwood, 13 tons had been cut into pieces from about 11 in., 12 in., 13 in., or 14 in., to 3½ ft. long. The captain's attention was called to the matter, and he said that he had had permission to saw the pieces up. A letter had apparently been written by the charterers' agent out at Belize to the consignee in London (Mr. Diesseldorf), in which some permission was given to the captain to cut up a few of the crooked logs, which were much too large to handle, and which would be much improved by cutting; but the contention was that he had exceeded his instructions. The jury found that the captain had exceeded his instructions, and awarded the plaintiff £10 damages, and the Judge allowed costs on the higher scale.
LARGE DRIVING BELTS.—Messrs. T. Icke & Son, of the Heath Leather Works, West Bromwich, have just manufactured two very large machine-driving leather belts. One belt is 469 ft. long, 14½ in. wide, ⅜ in. thick, and weighs about one ton. In making it up 24,000 copper rivets, weighing 2½ cwt., have been used. The length of the other belt is 180 ft., the width 15 in., and the thickness ⅜ in.
