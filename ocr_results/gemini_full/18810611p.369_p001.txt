JUNE 11, 1881.

Messrs. Brownlee & Co., of the City Sawmills, following the above sale, disposed of some parcels of deals as undernoted :—
Quebec red pine deals—
17 to 22 ft. 11 x 3 1s. 2½d. cub. ft.
12 „ 16 „ 7/14 x 3 1s. 1d. to 1s. 3½d. „
Do. 1st yellow pine planks, 12 ft. 7 x 2, 1s. 6½d. cub. ft.

LEITH.
The list of arrivals here for the past week is almost a blank. A cargo of Norwegian floorings has arrived, and is to be put up at Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co.'s sale on Tuesday first.
Foreign-wrought flooring does not seem to be in great buyers in this quarter, as there have been great objections made to most parcels previously sold.
At Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co.'s sale on Tuesday last very little business was done, the attendance being very thin. The only stuffs of which any quantity was disposed of were 7 x 2½ and 6½ x 2½ white battens, 3rd quality. The balance of the lots cleared out were stray lots here and there, of which the prices need not be given. The following is a note of prices :—
7 x 2½ white 3rd quality battens 1s. 1½d. per lin. ft.
6½ x 2½ „ „ „ 1s. 1d. „
5 x 2 white and red battens 11d. „
Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co. and Mitchell, Somerville, & Co., have both sales advertised for this month.

MAHOGANY AND HARDWOODS.
THE TEAK MARKETS.—In their Rangoon market report, Messrs. Bulloch Bros. & Co. say that there have been no supplies of teak for some time, and quotations are therefore nominal. The exports to Europe from April 22nd to May 5th were 980 tons, making a total of 5,031 tons since 1st Jan., against 750 tons during the same period last year. In their Moulmein market report they state that teak is in small supply, and high prices are being paid for all lots available. The exports to Europe from 16th to 29th April amounted to 1,279 tons, making a total of 11,406 tons since January 1st, as against 9,475 tons during the same period last year.

THROAT IRRITATION.—Soreness and dryness, tickling and irritation, inducing cough and affecting the voice. For these symptoms use Epps's Glycerine Jujubes. Glycerine, in these agreeable confections, being in proximity to the glands at the moment they are excited by the act of sucking, becomes actively healing. Sold only in boxes, 7½d. and 1s. 1½d., labelled "JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London." A letter received : "Gentlemen,—It may, perhaps, interest you to know that, after an extended trial, I have found your Glycerine Jujubes of considerable benefit (with or without medical treatment) in almost all forms of throat disease. They soften and clear the voice. In no case can they do any harm.—Yours faithfully, GORDON HOLMES, L.R.C.P.E., Senior Physician to the Municipal Throat and Ear Infirmary."—Advt.
