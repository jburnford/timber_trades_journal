THE WOOD BROKERS' CIRCULAR.
MESSRS. CHURCHILL & SIM's report that the delivery of wood from the docks during the past month has largely exceeded the import, and for the first five months of May the total import has been limited in quantity, while the deliveries have been moderate. The stock of deals, battens, and boards in the North American department has been reduced. The price of pine deals has been firm. Battens have been in fair request. Spruce deals have been freely sold, and large quantities are reported for arrival. Pitch pine has been in fair demand.
MESSRS. SIMSON & MASON's report that the business done during the past month has been of a limited character. The demand for goods for immediate requirements has been small. They have displayed great caution in their purchases. The stocks show a considerable reduction, both in deals and battens. The sales afloat are over 700,000 standards. The arrivals confirmed as on the way are very large from the docks. The stock of goods from the North of Europe is very large. The stock has been much reduced. The arrivals very late on the season. The first ships have arrived from Quebec. The prices for the downriver ports have been very firm. The assist market has been very active. The prepared flooring trade has been very quiet. Norway has been in fair request. The stock has been much reduced.
