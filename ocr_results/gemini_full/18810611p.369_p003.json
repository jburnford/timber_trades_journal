CHURCHILL & SIM say that the delivery of wood from the docks during the past month has largely exceeded the average delivery in the month of May, and, as the arrivals have been very limited in extent, the dock stock is now reduced to moderate compass. The excess in the quantity delivered seems to have been sent to the country districts, which, owing to the late winter, have not been able to draw supplies direct, and have found the low quotations in London an inducement to purchase here. The market has been unusually stagnant during the month; after the experience of the last three or four years, the trade seem to be afraid to make any extensive forward engagements. Norway flooring boards having been imported in moderate quantities have been saleable, and prices are well maintained. Of battens the import has been double that of last year; considerable sales have, however, been made at prices which do not compare unfavourably with the value of other goods. Swedish deals and battens have sold at about former prices, the old stock is nearly exhausted, and as the quantity for open-water shipment to London is expected to be small, early cargoes will probably sell favourably, and should realize about the free-on-board quotations.\n\nMessrs. SIMSON & MASON report that the business done during May in the market has been limited; the dealers have been supplying their immediate requirements mostly at auction, but have displayed no disposition to buy for shipment. The stocks show a decrease on last month’s figures in deals and battens (Baltic and American) of over 700,000 pieces, and notwithstanding the fact confirmed as it is by the large weekly deliveries from the docks, the trade has been unusually dull. North of Europe Deals, Planks, and Battens.—The stock has been much reduced, and, owing to the very late opening of navigation, but few vessels have arrived or are close at hand. This has checked the downward tendency of prices, and ought to assist materially in strengthening the market. Prepared Flooring Boards.—The first fleet from Norway has now mostly arrived. The demand has been fair, and a steady business has resulted. The stock is now a very moderate one. British North American Pine Deals and Battens.—Market has been very quiet, with a downward tendency in prices when pressed. Spruce Deals and Battens.—Stock slightly reduced, and prices have been unsteady. No fresh arrivals reported.\n\nMessrs. FARNWORTH & JARDINE, of Liverpool, state that the arrivals from British North America during the past month have been 7 vessels 6,128 tons, against 3 vessels, 2,879 tons, during the corresponding month last year. There has been a very fair aggregate consumption, exceeding that of the like month last year, but prices still tend downwards. Stocks, though not excessive, are still too heavy for the present sensitive state of the trade, and being on the eve of the fresh imports buyers naturally limit their purchases to what they can see their way to sell promptly.—Canadian Woods.—The inquiry for yellow pine is very languid, and there is no wholesale demand. Oak is very dull of sale, and prices are lower. Pine Deals: The stock is large, and there has been a decided fall in prices since the fresh imports have begun to arrive by steamers at exceptionally low rates of freight. Pipe and puncheon staves are in good demand, at full prices.—New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Spruce and Pine Deals.—There has been a large consumption during the past month, and the stock now is very little in excess of what was then in the market; sales, however, have been made at continuously declining prices during the month, though we cannot but think that we have arrived at about the lowest point. A new feature in the trade is the number of cargoes coming forward by steamers, though mostly to outports; this tends still further to make early sales difficult. Pitch Pine.—There has been a good consumption, about the same as during the month of May last year, and the stock is moderate; but buyers appear to have no confidence in the market even at the very low rates that are now ruling, and we see no immediate prospect of improvement.\n\nMessrs. DUNCAN, EWING, & Co., of Liverpool, say that, though the amount of business done during the past month has been larger than that of the preceding one, most of it must have been of a very unsatisfactory nature. Under the continuous pressure to sell, prices continue to droop, and with the larger stocks on hand at present\n\nand the near approach of the new import season, there is no probability of reaction setting in, at any rate for some time to come. North of Europe Wools.—Fir Timber: The imports during the month have been upon contract, and stocks now are sufficient for all probable requirements for the year. Redwood Deals: With heavy stocks, upon which the small consumption makes little impression, there is no disposition to purchase for future arrival. Sales by retail only. Flooring boards are being unduly pressed upon our already well-supplied market, with the effect that prices continue to rule very low, and will remain so until this pressure is taken off. Sales by retail only. Fir staves are not wanted, owing to the depressed condition of the chemical trade.\n\nMessrs. ROBERT COLTART & Co., of Liverpool, say that, although there has been a very fair consumption of wood during the past month, prices continue to have a downward tendency in consequence of forced sales, as stocks are too heavy, considering we are at the opening of the new import, and it is felt that a curtailment of the supplies for some time to come is necessary to sustain even present prices. A good harvest in this country, of which there is at present every prospect, would, however, give a considerable stimulus to trade, which would be followed by a better demand for wood.\n\nMessrs. ALFRED DOBELL & Co., of Liverpool, say:—We do not consider our trade has got into any worse position during May, and if the imports are only kept within moderate limits, to allow the merchants to work off their present yarded stocks, we may soon hope to see a healthier state of things. By private treaty several cargoes of spruce deals have been sold at £6 15s. per standard, and a small parcel of teak, transhipped from an outport, was sold at £13 10s. per load.\n\nMessrs. JAMES SMITH & Co., of Liverpool, state that there has been a little more business doing during the past month in this market, and more inquiry for cargoes around the coast. It would appear as if buyers were beginning to see that prices generally were at their lowest, but this will, however, depend very much upon the quantity that comes forward. If shippers will avoid sending consignments, and leave it to the merchants on this side to supply their requirements by contracts made in this country, no doubt it will have a very beneficial effect. Business generally in the manufacturing districts is anything but satisfactory, and as long as this continues much improvement in the timber trade cannot be expected.\n\nSHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\nFREIGHTS.\nThe freight market still continues to be very depressed, and the rates ruling are extremely low. Among others, we hear of a vessel having been fixed during the last few days at 36s. from Uleaborg to Hull.
