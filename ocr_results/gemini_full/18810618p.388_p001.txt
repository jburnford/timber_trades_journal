FRENCH CUSTOMS ARRANGEMENTS.
The following complaint from Messrs. White, Child, & Co., of 22, College Hill, Cannon Street, appeared in the *Daily Telegraph* of Thursday last:—"For the information of the commerical world and the authorities who are now negotiating the new French Treaty, we give the particulars of a case which has just happened to ourselves. We sent a parcel of boxwood rollers *vid* Dunkirk, declared at the invoice value—£26, or 650f. The authorities there estimated the value at double, and fined us for false declaration. Feeling confident of our right, we appealed, and we have just received the decision of these experts. They value our goods, which cost us 650f., at 1,670f. 50c., and charge us 10 per cent. duty, or ... 167 05
Also 50 per cent. extra for fine ... 83 53
Expenses of expertize ... 57 91
... 308 49
Less 10 per cent. already paid on 650f. ... 65 00
Total excess of duty ... 243f 49c
We are informed that we have no further appeal, that the decision of the experts is law. The amount in question in this case is small; but the principle to be considered in our negotiation is, whether importers are to be victims to the imbecility of experts who are wholly ignorant of the goods upon which they are called upon to fix a value."

FALL OF A DOCK WALL.—On Sunday afternoon last, one side of the newly-erected Sutton Bridge Docks, Lincolnshire, gave way and bulged out into the basin, carrying with it two engines, several buildings, and their adjoining lines of railway and a quantity of goods. The amount of damage is very considerable, and will probably fall upon the contractors, Messrs. Benton & Woodiwiss, as the docks were not handed over to the company. They were to be opened on the 29th amid great rejoicing. The Great Northern Railway Company's directors, who are large shareholders, inspected the docks on the 7th inst.

THE LONGEVITY OF THE OLIVE TREE.—It life-period is not certainly known. In the long course of years it becomes a mere shell, for it begins to die at the core, but the outer root does not perish. Out of this springs the new tree. In the very old olive groves about Palma, near Lisbon, in Portugal, I have noted this circumstance oftener than once. Travellers most competent to judge are agreed that the present olive trees on Mount Olivet, near Jerusalem, are the same that Christ and His disciples fell asleep under 1,900 years ago, and they are even now yielding their annual crop of fruit.—*The Californian*.

LARGE CONTRACTS FOR TIMBER.—The largest contracts for tree products ever made in Mobile, Ala., were consummated recently between Mr. S. W. Hastings, purchasing agent for the Mexican National Railroad Company, and Messrs. C. C. Kauffman & Co. and Messrs. Stoutz & Co. Messrs. C. C. Kauffman & Co. have contracted to deliver 400,000 ft. of car and bridge timber during each month to Jan. 1, 1882, besides an unlimited number of cross-ties and piling. They have contracted for 100,000 cross-ties and 7,000 telegraph poles. All this timber is pine except the telegraph poles, which are of cypress. Various ports on the Gulf coast competed for this contract, but Mobile secured the prize.—*Engineering News*.

EPPS'S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.—"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately-flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame."—*Civil Service Gazette*. Made simply with boiling water or milk. Sold only in Packets labelled—"JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London."—Also makers of Epps's Chocolate Essence for afternoon use.—*Advt*.

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
CRIPPS v. HOAR.
This was an appeal in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, before Mr. Justice Fry, against the decision of the arbitrator in the above case, which has been previously reported in the *Timber Trades Journal*. The point raised was as to whether the arbitrator was correct in estimating the stock at its value at the time of the cessation of the joint trading or at the date of the order of the court. An order was made confirming the arbitrator's decission, with costs of appeal.

AKERBLOM v. PRICE.
This was an action before the Court of Appeals to recover general average contribution for alleged salvage services, and raised the question whether a pilot could recover salvage under the following circumstances:—A brigantine, the *Ailo*, returning from Finland with a cargo of deals met with a heavy gale, and her captain, instead of going on to Barrow-in-Furness, steered for Morecambe Bay to obtain a pilot. Having got into a place where the navigation was difficult and dangerous, the vessel signalled for a pilot, and it being noticed from the shore that she was getting near shallows, a pilot schooner put out, manned by several men, who, though they were pilots, were not the proper crew of that pilot schooner, with the exception of the sailing-master. Finding the weather too rough for them to get on board, the crew of the pilot schooner signalled to the *Ailo* the course she was to take. She altered her course in obedience to the signal, and reached a place of safety without sustaining any injury, although while following the pilot schooner she twice touched the ground. The pilot crew made a claim for salvage to the amount of £500, and the shipowner having offered £100, the present was an action brought by the shipowner against the cargo-owners for general average contribution for salvage services. At the trial before Mr. Baron Pollock and a special jury, at the Guildhall, the latter stopped the case upon the point as to the capacity in which the pilot crew went out, whether as pilots or salvors, and in the result returned a verdict for the defendants. A Divisional Court granted a rule for a new trial on the ground of misdirection, but refused one on the ground that the verdict beinga gainst the weight of evidence, and the plaintiff afterwards obtained a rule *nisi* on the latter ground in this court. The rule on the ground of misdirection having been made absolute, the defendants appealed, and also showed cause against the rule *nisi* granted by this court. Mr. H. Matthews, Q.C. and Mr. A. Cross appeared for the defendants; Mr. Day, Q.C., and Mr. F. G. Randolph (with whom was Mr. Pollard) for the plaintiff.
Lord Justice Bramwell now stated that judgment would be for the plaintiff, on the ground that his claim was rightly made for salvage, and that a written judgment giving the reasons for this decision would be delivered at a future time.

ENGLISH JOINERS.—A correspondent writing to the *Builder*, in reference to the statement that Messrs. J. Sandell & Co. have always 20,000 doors of Swedish manufacture on hand, assumes that other merchants of London have their thousands too on hand, and goes on to say: "Is not that a poor look-out for young men or our apprentice boys who are striving to learn the trade of carpenter and joiner? And it must stagger the parent who is about to give £30 or £40 for his boy to learn a good trade which he always took so much delight in himself. The parent, if he has any discernment in him, must see that the joiner will soon be a thing of the past, and men will see that the day will come when England will look round for her joiners, and ask, 'Where are they?' What say our builders to this? Are they in such a hurry to get rich that they neglect the tender shoots of our trade? Is the boy to be thought of no more? Is the joiner to be ruined? If our builders were to think for a moment they would see that in our own good joiners' shops we can hold our own with any Swedish firm if we are only rightly encouraged."

DUBLIN.—The *Irish Times* says that "the demand has been very good all round during the week. Favourite dimensions of spruce are now very scarce, and fresh arrivals are anxiously looked forward to. Pitch pine, both sawn and hewn, out of the latest cargoes has been in request. The market has been bare of Norway poles for some time past, but a cargo of them is now being landed. The following are the latest quotations:—St. John and Miramichi deals, £13 10s. to £15, according to dimensions; oak, £6 10s. to £7; ash, 85s. in lots; elm, 85s. to 90s.; red pine, 65s. in lots; pitch pine (sawn), 62s. 6d. to 65s.; pitch pine (hewn), 65s. to 70s.; staves (pipe), £87 10s.; flooring (white Norway), 9s. 6d. to 10s. 6s. Slates: Owing to the great difficulty in getting the larger sizes of Penrhyn slates from the quarries they are now very scarce in this city. In consequence of this scarcity prices are very firm, and have a tendency to rise."
