AMERICAN AND CANADIAN ITEMS.
THE NEW YORK Real Estate Record, in its lumber report of the 4th inst., says: "Business continues good all around, supplies are generally selling close to the offering, especially for near-by delivery, and prices are well maintained for all attractive goods and assortments. In fact, it is a good, healthy, and cheerful market, with no reason to expect the favourable elements will vanish for some time to come. Dealers are on the look out for additions to assortment and the interest of exporters is retained to a very fair extent, though on some grades the foreign demand has been diverted to parcels at primary points. Choice well-seasoned stuff of all kind is becoming somewhat scarce, and holders who have anything of the kind in stock talk rather firmer."
The Lumberman's Gazette, of Bay City, Mich. says, "The full tide of the spring trade is flooding this market, and activity and eagerness bear rule. There have been a good many buyers in the valley the past week, and the receipt of orders has been quite large. While there has not been such a boom in transactions as occurred several times last season, a goodly number of advantageous sales have been effected."
The lumber to be used in the floor of the Brooklyn bridge is to be creosoted. It is now being treated under contract by Edward R. Andrews at Elizabethport, N.J. It will require about 1,100,000 ft. of yellow pine. One-quarter of the whole quantity is now ready, and its delivery has been begun. The rest will be ready before July 1st.
LEITH DOCKS.-The sea was let in on Wednesday last to a new wet dock for the port of Leith, which will be formally opened in the month of August. A name has not yet been fixed upon for the dock, but "Gladstone" or "Edinburgh" is being suggested. The new works, which include graving dock, breakwater, &c., will cost about £400,000.
