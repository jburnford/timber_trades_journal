  "text": "MODERN RAPIDITY OF DISCHARGE.\nIn reply to an inquiry from Cardiff, the *Shipping and Mercantile Gazette* states that, with a sufficiency of labour, about 100 standards should be discharged per diem from a steamer. Our contemporary seems to have only a faint idea of what can be done in the way of discharging steamers, or else considers Cardiff a somewhat slow port; otherwise we cannot understand their putting the quantity per diem, with a sufficiency of labour, at 100 standards. For their information and that of our readers we may state that the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, with experience in these matters, guarantee to discharge a minimum quantity of 150 standards of deals and battens per day; and more often than otherwise their day's work is 200 standards.\nAs an instance of rapid discharge, we may refer to the celerity with which a cargo of grain, consisting of 9,045 quarters of oat*, was recently discharged from the *Ottawa*. She commenced discharge on Monday morning at 7.30, and was cleared by 9 o'clock on the evening of the same day, the whole of the ship's cargo being weighed, and warehoused in the companies' granaries in 13½ hours, including stoppages for meals. In noting the time taken in discharging the cargo ex *Ottawa*, the fact must not be lost sight of that the three consignments of oats were stowed separately in the ship's hold, and had to be worked and cleared up distinctly. Had the cargo consisted of one parcel in bulk, the discharge would have been completed in some hours' less time.\nThis is another instance of what well-selected machinery and good management in regulating labour will do in giving steamships despatch, and compares favourably with what the Surrey Commercial Dock Company have already done in discharging steamships with wood cargoes. We have in the smart manner in which steamers are taken in hand by the company; they are now often docked, berthed, discharged, and undocked within 24 hours. One vessel last season, the *Pallion*, with 623 standards, was unloaded in 18 hours; quick delivery was, of course, owing to the ship being exceptionally well adapted for carrying deal cargoes, but it is no uncommon feat for the Dock Company, when the discharge is placed in their hand, to put out 300 standards per diem.\n\nSHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\nFOREIGN CLEARANCES.\nQUEBEC.—June 3rd, per boards, Progress, for London, 29,264 pine deals, 1,000 ends, 2,200 boards; 4th, Ajmeer, for Greenock, 125 pcs. oak, 1,030 do. white pine, 90 do. red pine, 90 do. white pine, 29 do. ash, 4,069 pine deals; 7th, Viking, for Greenock, 49 pcs. oak, 12 do. birch, 2 do. ash, 300 pine deals, 13,252 pine deals; 8th, Norway, for London, 109 pcs. oak, 80 pcs. elm, 643 do. white pine, 1,379 pine deals and ends; Diligentia, for Greenock, 137 pcs. oak, 18 do. elm, 679 do. white pine, 88 do. birch, 1 do. ash, 1 do. walnut, 1,500 pine deals, 2m.
