GLASGOW.
The arrivals of wood goods at the Clyde ports during the week amount to about 10,000 loads, the bulk of which consists of Quebec log timber, the first of this season's importation.
There are no public sales to report.
Stocks on hand at 30th June are shown in appended statement. The consumption of Quebec timber during the quarter ending on 30th June will be seen by contrast with the statement of stock on 31st March, there having been no arrivals of logs from Quebec in the interval. Taking into account the arrivals of pitch pine during the three months, the amount of consumption for the quarter is shown to be as follows:—hewn and sawn timber, 7,895 loads; planks, 850 loads.
Quebec deals, of which there have been considerable arrivals during last month, appear to have gone into consumption during the quarter to the extent of 2,580 Petersburg standards.
Most of the stock of lower port deals is in consumers' hands.
The stock of staves, it will be observed, is extremely light.

THE TIMBER USED FOR MATCHES.—Five hundred and fifty-five thousand hours of each successive day are spent by the inhabitants of Europe in striking lucifer matches upon the box and other wise. The computation is based upon the following curious statistics:—Europe, continental and insular, consumes two milliards of matches daily. Assuming that each several act of ignition occupies the brief period of one second—and we have reason to believe that it is rarely performed in a shorter time—it will be obvious to every ready reckoner that the above-mentioned amazing number of hours must be diurnally devoted to the production of artificial light by friction, in our quarter of the globe alone. There is food for much quaint speculation in the seemingly anomalous fact that Europeans dispose of nearly sixty-four per diem in scraping tiny sticks, tipped with some inflammable composition, upon sympathetic substances of various descriptions. It is also interesting to learn that four hundred thousand cubic yards of timber and four hundred and twenty thousand pounds weight of phosphorus are in annual request for the manufacture of the seven hundred and thirty thousand millions of matches used up by Europe in the course of every year.
SAWDUST seems to be a valuable commodity in New York. According to the *North-Western Lumberman* there are about 500 vendors of the article in that city, having a capital of 200,000 dols. invested, and doing a business amounting to more than 2,000,000 dols. annually. Forty years ago the mills were glad to have sawdust carted away; 25 years ago it could be bought for 50 c. a load; but the price has increased, and now it brings 3 dols. 50 c. a load at the mills.
POWERFUL MACHINERY IN AMERICA.—Speaking of the machinery used in the Western mines, a prominent mining engineer recently said that in some of the deep mines there are employed single engines capable of raising a column of water weighing 90,000 lbs. a distance of 1,600 ft., seven times a minute; also, that safety cages used in mines travel at the rate of 3,000 ft. a minute, and propelled by a single engine are able to hoist 1,200 tons of ore a distance of 1,500 ft. in one day. —*Scientific American*.
THROAT IRRITATION.—Soreness and dryness, tickling and irritation, inducing cough and affecting the voice. For these symptoms use Epps's Glycerine Jujubes. Glycerine, in these agreeable confections, being in proximity to the glands at the moment they are excited by the act of sucking, becomes actively healing. Sold only in boxes, 7½d. and 1s.1½d., labelled "JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London." A letter received: "Gentlemen,—It may, perhaps, interest you to know that, after an extended trial, I have found your Glycerine Jujubes of considerable benefit (with or without medical treatment) in almost all forms of throat disease. They soften and clear the voice. —Yours faithfully, GORDON HOLMES, L.R.C.P.E., Senior Physician to the Municipal Throat and Ear Infirmary.'—*Advt*.
