LEITH.
The arrivals at this port are still light, consisting chiefly of a few cargoes of deals and battens and a parcel of lathwood.
Messrs. William Thomson & Co. held a sale of American and Baltic timber on the sands, at the foot of Constitution Street, on Thursday last.
The company was very numerous, as was to be expected at the first sale of this season’s yellow pine.
The yellow pine was in good condition, a good part of the waney being cleared out at prices varying from 2s. 7d. to 2s. 9d.
Small-sized pine was hardly in as good demand, although a good quantity was disposed of at from 2s. to 2s. 3 1/2d.
Only one lot of birch was disposed of, the exposers deciding to hold the remainder.
Oak was not in demand, only one lot being knocked down at the low figure of 2s. 10d., at which price the auctioneer refused to go on, the balance being consequently passed over.
After the sale of American timber was over, a few lots of deals and battens were put up, but buyers could hardly be found at any figure.
Red Petersburg 9 x 3 deals 1sts quality fetched from 2 1/2d. to 2 3/4d., the 2nd going at 2 3/8d.
A few lots of red 6 1/2 x 2 1/2 Hernosand battens, 4ths, 3rds, and 2nds, were disposed of at 1 7/8d.
The following is a note of prices realized :—
Waney yellow pine, 23 in. average, 2s. 7d. to 2s. 9d. c. ft.
Do., small size, 2s. 5d. c. ft.
Square yellow pine, 2s. 0 1/2d. to 2s. 3 1/2d. c. ft.
Birch (one lot), 1s. 9d. c. ft.
Ash, 1s. 11 1/2d. c. ft.
Elm, 2s. c. ft.
Oak (one lot), 2s. 10d. c. ft.
3rd yellow pine deals, 12 & 11 x 3, 1s. 2d. c. ft.

Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, & Co. advertise a sale of deals and battens for the 19th inst.

THE USE OF NATURAL WOOD v. PAINTING.
As Sir Roger de Coverley would say when he wished to dodge a question, “much might be said on both sides,” but Mr. Gardner states the whole subject so felicitously, says the American Furniture Gazette, that we will let him present his views somewhat at length :—
To answer according to the spirit of your inquiry, I should say, by all means (if you do not mind the cost) use wood instead of putty.
With all respect for white paint and striped paint and all other kinds of paint, there is nothing more enduringly satisfying than the natural tints and grain of the different kinds of wood suitable for building, of which we have such great variety in style and colour, from the over-estimated black walnut to the rarely-used white pine, rarely used without having its natural beauty extinguished by three

coats of paint.
What I wish to say is, that finishing your woodwork without paint does not necessarily require the said wood to be of the kinds commonly called hard.
Any wood that is not specially disposed to warp, and that can be smoothly wrought, may be used.
There are several important points to be religiously observed if you leave the wood, whatever the variety, in its unadorned beauty.
It must be the best of its kind; it must be seasoned to its inmost fibre; it must be wrought skilfully, tenderly cared for, and, finally, filled and rubbed till it wears a surface that is not liable to soil, is easily cleaned, resists the action of moisture, and will grow richer with age.
Hence, I say, by all means finish with unpainted wood, if you are not afraid of the expense, and yet paint and varnish are good, and putty, like charity, covereth a multitude of sins.
Nothing protects wood better than oil and lead, and by means of them you have unlimited choice of colours, in the selection and arrangement of which there is room and need for genuine artistic taste.
Yes, good honest paint is worthy the utmost respect.
When it tries to improve upon Nature’s divine methods and calls itself “graining,” it becomes unmitigated nonsense,—yes, and worse.
It is one of the sure evidences of man’s innate perversity that he persists in trying to copy certain beautiful lines and shadings in wood, not as an art study, but for actual use, when he may just as well have the perfect original as his own faulty imitation.
What conceit, what blindness, what impudence this reveals!
What downright falsehood!
Not in the painter,—oh no! skill is commendable even when unworthily employed,—but in him who orders it.
You may buy a pine door, which is very well; pine doors are good; you tell every man that comes into your house it’s black walnut, or oak, or mahogany.
If that is not greeting him with lying lips and a deceitful heart, the moral law is not as clear as it ought to be.
You may think it is of no consequence—certainly not worth making a fuss about—but I tell you this spirit of sham that pervades our whole social structure, that more and more obtrudes itself in every department of life, comes from the bottomless pit, and will carry us all thither, unless we resist it, even in these milder manifestations, as we would resist the Father of Lies himself.
Truth and falsehood are getting so hopelessly confused that we can scarcely distinguish one from the other.
One other suggestion in this connection.
Without either painting or graining you may get a most satisfactory effect, both in looks and utility, by staining the less costly kinds of woods, using a transparent stain that will not conceal but strengthen the natural shading, and at the same time change its tint according to your fancy.
This is an honest and economical expedient.
It only requires that your lumber shall be sound, tolerably clear—a good hard knot isn’t alarming—seasoned, and put up with care.
The cost is less than common painting, and the effect as much better than graining as nature’s work is more perfect than ours.
From the consideration of painting, per se, we naturally glide to the question of graining or deceptive painting, which Ruskin has just declared inadmissible.
And here we may say that, however much they may be at variance on other points, there is substantial accord among art writers in condemning graining.
Mr. Gardner has had his tilt at it in the extract already given, and Ruskin pounces upon it with all his pugnacious virulence :—
“There is no meaner occupation for the human mind than the imitation of the stains and striæ of wood and marble.
The grainer must think of what he is doing, and veritable attention and care, and occasionally considerable skill, are consumed in the doing of a more absolute nothing than I can name in any other department of painful idleness.
I know not anything so humiliating as to see a human being with arms and limbs complete, and apparently a head, and assuredly a soul, yet into the hands of which when you have put a brush and palette, it cannot do anything with them but imitate a piece of wood.
It cannot colour: it has no idea of colour.
It cannot draw: it has no idea of form.
It cannot caricature: it has no idea of humour.”
Eastlake says his say about it as follows:—“It is an objectionable and pretentious deceit, which cannot be excused even on the grounds of economy.
In the last century, when English oak and Spanish mahogany could be procured at a reasonable price, the grainer’s work was, of course, unneeded.
In modern days the usual substitute for those now expensive woods is deal; but deal is so soft and absorbent in its fibre that it quickly becomes soiled, and in most situations, especially when exposed to the air, it soon requires painting.
But why should we paint it in imitation of oak?
Everybody can see at a glance that it is not oak, and, as far as appearance is concerned, there are many modes of treatment which would be far more effective.”
