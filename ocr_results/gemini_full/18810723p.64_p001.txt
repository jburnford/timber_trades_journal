THE NEW BUILDINGS IN THROGMORTON AVENUE.
No part of the City has been more modernized within the last few years by the erection of some new buildings for commercial purposes than the locality stretching between London Wall and Throgmorton-street. The freehold of the greater part of the area in this neighbourhood belongs to the Carpenters' and the Drapers' Companies, the first-named company having some time ago completed and opened their new hall at the corner of London Wall and Throgmorton Avenue, have in succession leased the adjoining land belonging to them on both sides of the avenue, on which large buildings of a costly character, for commercial purposes, have been erected, including the large some block of offices for the Submarine Telegraph Company (illustrated in the Builder in November last), a fine building for the Imperial Bank of Ireland, another building adjoining, of very large dimensions, now in course of erection for Messrs. Gooch & Cousens, together with several other blocks for general office purposes. The one remaining site in that part of the avenue belonging to the Carpenters' Company has just been let. It consists of the exact site upon which the old Carpenters' Hall formerly stood, and immediately adjoins the Submarine Telegraph Company's offices. A new building is now in course of erection upon the site, from the designs of Mr. Chancellor, architect, and we learn that it is to be similar in its architectural features to the Telegraph Company's buildings adjoining it. The Drapers' Company have likewise leased nearly the whole of their land adjoining, in the direction of Throgmorton Street, upon which similar large blocks of mercantile buildings have been erected.—Builder.

BRITISH AND FOREIGN TIMBER.—In the House of Commons, on Monday week, Mr. Pugh asked the Postmaster-General whether it is the fact that the Post Office department uses foreign timber only for telegraph posts, whereas many railway companies use home-grown timber for that purpose; and, if so, whether he will cause inquiry to be made as to the relative price and value of home-grown and foreign timber in different portions of the United Kingdom, with a view to directing the use of home-grown timber where such a course can be adopted with advantage or without prejudice to the public service. Mr. Fawcett stated that the telegraph poles were of foreign timber, and he found that foreign timber was also used by the railway companies for similar purposes. The reason why foreign timber was preferred was the greater durability arising out of what was known as the creosote process, which made it last much longer than home-grown timber.

ARBITRATION CASE.—Mr. H. L. Friend, of Dawlish, who was appointed to arbitrate in the case of Baker v. Hawking, the plaintiff being a builder, and defendant a lodging-house keeper, at Dawlish, has awarded the former £8 17s. 4d. on a claim to recover £25, balance alleged to be due for building done in 1877. The case has been in the Court of Common Pleas, and the arbitrator allowed a counter-claim for £6 14s. 6d. Former agent of defendant was connected with certain payments, which was the main cause of litigation.

THROAT IRRITATION.—Soreness and dryness, tickling and irritation, inducing cough and affecting the voice. For these symptoms use Epps's Glycerine Jujubes. Glycerine, in these agreeable confections, being in proximity to the glands at the moment they are excited by the act of sucking, becomes actively healing. Sold only in boxes, 7½d. and 1s. 1½d., labelled “JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London.” A letter received : “GENTLEMEN,—It may, perhaps, interest you to know that, after an extended trial, I have found your Glycerine Jujubes of considerable benefit (with or without medical treatment) in almost all forms of throat disease. They soften and clear the voice. —Yours faithfully, GORDON HOLMES, L.R.C.P.E., Senior Physician to the Municipal Throat and Ear Infirmary.”—Advt.
