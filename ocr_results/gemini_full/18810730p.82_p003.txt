SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
FREIGHTS.
The market remains about the same, and there are no signs of a further business improvement. The weakening in Canadian business has been the year's demand for tonnage from the considerable dem for tonnage from the Baltic and White Sea ports, but now that the ice has broken up and weeks spread scare completely disappeared, there is an exceedingly slack demand for tonnage, and very fair rates are offering. From the Gulf, 6d. to 28s. July-August loading is offering. From Cronstadt, 27s. 6d. to 28s. July-August. From Riga, 27s. 6d. to 28s. is offered. From GRIMSBY we have received a telegram with news to report no inquiry for tonnage, and little more from Bristol. From London and props from 24s. 6d. to 25s. is offered. The Cardiff freights are still very low. We now pay Cardiff from 25s. to 25s. 6d. hence to the Bristol Channel, 24s. 6d. The Bristol Channel freights are based on 170 standards ship's measurement. From Cardiff-M. M.
QUEBEC.-No change to report in this market. We learn that from freights have been done at 60s. Quebec during the past week, and this is decidedly a very low rate. We have not heard of any inquiry for tonnage from Lower St. Lawrence ports.
TRADE ITEMS.
The Editor will be glad to receive for insertion in this column any items of general trade interest.
TRADE CHANGE.-Messrs. R. Melville & Co., timber merchants, Grahamstone, Falkirk, announce the dissolution of partnership. Mr. J. H. Melville will continue the business.
* * *
THE LIGNA COMPANY, of Stockholm, of which Mr. C. P. J. Ekman is managing director, have opened a London warehouse and office at 4, Tabernacle Row, City Road, E.C. The agent in London is Mr. C. Bernh. Ketscher.
* * *
The employes of Messrs. E. A. & W. Greenslade, saw-mill proprietors, &c., of Bristol, had their annual outing at Torquay on Saturday, and spent a very pleasant day.
* * *
SHIPPING CASUALTY.-A Norwegian schooner, named the Fleetwing, on arriving near Gorleston, Norfolk, with 200 standards of deals for Messrs. Jewson & Sons, ran into the quay, crushing in a portion of the woodwork and ploughing into the earth, sustaining considerable damage.
* * *
LARGE ORDER FOR WOOD-WORKING MACHINERY.-We are informed that Messrs. M. Powis & Co., saw-mill engineers, 20, Budge Row, have received an order to erect a plant of machinery in Queensland for the manufacture of all kinds of brushes. The machinery includes shaping, bristle filling, trimming, multiple boring machines, &c. Several of the boring machines are designed to bore 15,000 holes per hour, and are of the most advanced construction.
* * *
RUSSIAN FLOORS.-The finest floors are said to be seen in Russia. For those of the highest grade, tropical woods are exclusively employed. Fir and pine are never used, as in consequence of their sticky character they attract and retain dust and dirt, and thereby soon become blackened. Pitch pine too is liable to shrink, even after being well seasoned. The mosaic wood floors in Russia are of extraordinary beauty. One, in the Summer Palace, is of small squares of ebony inlaid with mother-of-pearl. A considerable trade is done in Dantzig and Riga by exporting small blocks of oak for parquet floors. There is an active demand in France and Germany, but none in England.
* * *
THE COOPER'S ART is receiving the attention of the Admiralty, in view of its connection with the work of submarine mining and torpedo operations. New regulations have therefore been issued with regard to coopers in Government employ, who must thoroughly understand cask-making, and how to strengthen a cask so that it will stand the external pressure of eleven fathoms of water. They are also to be trained to understand flagging and the various special fittings required for torpedo purposes. After instruction has been given them in these and other departments of technical work, coopers are to be examined on board two specified vessels, in order that the authorities may know how far their knowledge of their art extends beyond tub and bucket-making.
