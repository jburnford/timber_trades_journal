From Quebec the demand for tonnage is nominal, and at poor rates. From the Baltic there is a firmer tendency noticeable, and a fair demand for tonnage, both on the coast and from France, at higher rate than has been paid for the past few months, and the advance in the season will doubtless have the effect of a further rise.\nThe following are the latest quotations:-\nQuebec to U.K., 57s. 6d. deals, option timber 22s.\n\" Clyde, 22s. hardwood and yellow pine.\n\" Newport, 23s. to 24s. hardwood, deals, and white pine.\n\" Bristol, 22s. to 23s. yellow pine.\n\" Limerick, &c., 62s. deals, option timber 23s.\n\" Portsmouth, 23s. timber.\n\" Sunderland, 22s. timber.\nRiver Quelle to Ireland, 50s. deals.\nMetis, Matane, &c., to London and named Irish ports, 35s. to 37s. 6d. nominal.\nSaguenay to London, 55s.\n\" Marseilles, 70s.\nMiramichi to Bristol Channel, 57s. 6d. to 60s. deals.\n\" West Coast, 57s. 6d. and 60s. deals.\n\" London, 60s. deals.\n\" Cardiff or Newport, 57s. 6d. deals.\n\" Barrow, Fleetwood, Maryport, or Whitehaven, 60s. deals.\n\" Avonmouth Dock, 60s. deals.\nLiscombe to Continent, 78 frcs. deals.\nNova Scotia to West Coast, 55s. deals.\nSt. John, Miramichi, Dalhousie, or Bathurst to London East Coast, 60s. deals or West Coast.\n\" Glasgow, 60s. deals.\n\" Belfast, 57s. 6d.\nSt. John, N.B., to Liverpool or Mersey, 57s. 6d. deals.\n\" Ireland (not afloat), 55s. deals.\nPensacola to U.K., 88s. hewn, 117s. 6d. sawn.\nDoboy to U.K., 36s. and 115s. hewn and sawn timber.\nArchangel to London, 57s. 6d. deals and ends.\n\" Hull, 52s. 6d. deal, batten, and board ends.\n\" Grimsby, 50s. deals.\nMesane to London, 57s. 6d. deals and ends.\n\" Grimsby, 50s. deals.\n\" Firth of Forth, 47s. 6d. to 50s. deals.\nFredrikstad to London, 32s. 6d. firewood.\n\" London, 27s. 6d. flooring.\n\" Melbourne, £4 10s. deals.\nGefle or District to London, 32s. 6d. deals.\n\" London, 42s. 6d. firewood.\n\" West Hartlepool, 32s. 6d. to 34s.\n\" Bristol, 40s. to 42s. 6d. deals.\nSoderhamn to London, 35s. to 37s. 6d. deals.\n\" Hull, 32s. 6d. one-half deals, one-half boards.\n\" W.
