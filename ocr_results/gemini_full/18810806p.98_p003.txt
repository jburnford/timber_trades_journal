SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
FREIGHTS.
There is still a want of activity in the American freight market, rates ruling exceedingly low. From Quebec the demand for tonnage is nominal, and at poor rates. From the Baltic there is a firmer tendency noticeable, and a fair demand for tonnage, both on the coast and from France, at higher rate than has been paid for the past few months, and the advance in the season will doubtless have the effect of a further rise.
