MIDLAND RAILWAY CARRIAGE AND WAGGON COMPANY.—The directors of this company have decided to recommend the payment of a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the ordinary and 6 per cent. per annum on the preference shares.
TRADE WITH SIBERIA.—Information received at Lloyd's from Gothenburg, dated Aug. 5th, states that the A. E. Nordenskjold (s) would not go out to the relief of the frozen-up steamer Oscar Dickson, as Mr. Siberiakoff had telegraphed to his agent at Gothenburg that he had sent from Obdorsk a great number of reindeer carrying the quantity of coal and oil required to enable the Oscar Dickson to proceed on her voyage.

SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
FREIGHTS.
Wood freights are getting tighter, owing to the fact that vessels are now absent from the list, and very few are now offering. The lateness of the season at the Swedish ports, with the sluggishness of the demand for the checked chartering heretofore, but now the owners of all cargoes will have to be accommodated, and as there is really business offering more plentifully, it is said that many of the early Gulf shipments are being talked about between the Baltic and the White Ocean, kept back by westerly winds, for which there has certainly been a long spell, and these will only be able to make one voyage more; there is therefore no likelihood of our being overstocked with wood, and part water should last till late in the year, and steamers continue to take in an important part of the carrying trade; some of these old Balticmen, and do the business in less than half the time.
