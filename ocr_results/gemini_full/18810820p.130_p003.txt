SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
FREIGHTS.
The high rates lately ruling from Norway have had the effect of attracting tonnage in this direction, thereby considerably affecting the supply from the Baltic.
Rates have lately, consequent upon the extra supply of tonnage, weakened from Norway, and sailing vessels are turning their attention more in the direction of the Baltic, and a less hardened tone is therefore apparent.
Some business, but not much, has within the last few days been moving, which could hardly have been said of the previous few weeks.
QUEBEC, Aug. 4th.-Three hundred and eighty-eight sea-going vessels have been entered at the Custom House since the opening of navigation.
Transactions during the week-London, deals, 60s.; Liverpool, timber, 24s.; Cardiff, sleepers, 60s. per std.; Greenock, oak plank, 70s.; timber, 20s.; Valencia, deals, 70s.; per steam, Avonmouth, deals, 40s.; do. Liverpool, deals, 45s.; do. London, deals, 52s. 6d.-Quebec Chronicle.
ST. JOHN, N.B.-Mr. J. L. Woodworth, under date August 5th, reports that freights have recently advanced; several large ships have been placed at 55s. for Liverpool, which is an advance of 3s. 9d. per standard on previous rates.
Stocks of deals very light.
