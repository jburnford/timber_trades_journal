  "text": "AUGUST 27, 1881.\n\nfine condition, and quality very superior.\nStocks do not appear to increase, although the imports are heavy, most goods apparently going forward into consumption direct.\nPrices remain in much the same condition, if any change it is upwards, and with the prospect of heavier insurances and freights prices are firm, and likely to remain so.\nMr. John Bowman, timber merchant of the town, having added the business of auctioneering to his former occupation, made his debut as a knight of the hammer on Tuesday last.\nThe cargo operated upon was a parcel of Tornea deals 9 & 11 x 3.\nMr. Bowman had a fair audience to witness his maiden effort, and the bulk of the goods found purchasers at a price about £8 to £8 15s. per standard, quality described as 70 per cent. 1st, and 30 per cent. 2nds.\nA sale of American wainscot logs and planks, just landed per steamer from America, is announced for Wednesday next by Messrs. Atkinson & Garland.\nThe arrivals by steamers from America to Tyne are now bringing forward sundry descriptions of wood goods, such as doors, mouldings, staves for casks ready for use, planks of various furniture woods, &c., which are coming into competition with the home manufacture, and appear to carry the palm against them.\n\nGLASGOW.\nImports of foreign timber to the Clyde during the past week have been to the extent of about 5,000 loads, consisting of two cargoes teak, one of Quebec timber and deals, and several parcels of wainscot billets, American and Italian walnut, &c.\nThe tonnage employed for the conveyance of teak imported to Clyde since beginning of the year aggregates 7,819 tons, being rather more than for corresponding period of 1880.\nThe last arrivals this year were in March.\nThere has been a falling off in the imports of birch this year, the arrivals from Quebec and lower ports amounting to 5,000 logs, as against 8,000 last year at corresponding date.\nA public sale was held here on 23rd inst. by Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co., brokers.\nThe goods offered consisting chiefly of New Brunswick spruce deals and Picton, N.S., birch timber.\nThe attendance was good, and a fair portion of the catalogue was disposed of at following rates:—Pictou birch timber, about 500 logs sold, one page of 21 logs, average 17¼ in. square (some logs figured), at 1s. 7½d. per cubic foot, string measure, the remainder, say from 15 in. to 16 in. average square, at from 1s. 2½d. to 1s. 4d. per cubic foot.\nA parcel of 39 logs American black walnut (round), from 10 to 19 in. girth, sold at from 2s. 7d. to 4s. 11½d. per cubic foot, string measure, average 3s. 5½d.\nFor lower port deals suitable for staging, planks, box-making, &c., a fair demand still continues; over 20,000 pieces were sold, rates as undernoted:—\nSt. John, N.B., spruce deals— cub. ft.\n9 to 25 ft. 15/17 x 3 10d. „\n9 „ 25 „ 14 x 3 10½d. „\n9 „ 25 „ 13 x 3 10½d. & 10¾d. „\n12 „ 25 „ 12 x 3 10¾d. „\n20 „ 24 „ 12 x 3 10½d. „\n9 „ 19 „ 12 x 3 10½d. „\n20 & 21 „ 11 x 3 11d. „\n13 to 19 „ 11 x 3 10½d. & 10¾d. „\n9 „ 24 „ 10 x 3 10½d. „\n9 „ 13 „ 9 x 3 10½d. & 10¾d. „\n9 „ 24 „ 8 x 3 9¾d. „\n10 „ 25 „ 7 x 3 9d. to 9¼d. „\nDo. spruce scantlings—\n10 to 24 ft. 2/5 x 3 8½d. „\nDo. spruce boards—\n10 to 23 ft. 3/11 x 1 7½d. „\nDo. 4th spruce deals—\n10 to 23 ft. 7/18 x 3 7¾d. „\nMiramichi, N.B., spruce deals—\n9 to 23 ft. 10/18 x 3 10d. „\n9 „ 21 „ 9 x 3 10¼d. „\n9 „ 22 „ 7/8 x 3 9d. „\nDo. spruce battens—\n9 to 22 ft. 7 x 2½ 9d. „\nDo. spruce scantlings—\n9 to 24 ft. 6 x 3 9d. „\n9 „ 23 „ 3/5 x 3 8d. „\nPictou, N.S., spruce deals—\n9 to 22 ft. 12/18 x 3 10d. „\n9 „ 23 „ 11 x 3 10½d. „\n9 „ 23 „ 9/10 x 3 10½d. „\n9 „ 25 „ 8 x 3 9½d. „\n9 „ 25 „ 7 x 3 8¾d. „\nDo. spruce battens and scantlings, 9 to 18 ft. 7 x 2½ & 6 x 3, 9d. cub. ft.\nDo. spruce deal ends, 4 to 8 ft. 4 to 14 x 3, 8d. cub. ft.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\n\nLEITH.\nThe list of arrivals shows the imports for the last seven days to include 62,443 pieces deals and battens, a few parcels lathwood, and one arrival from Quebec, viz., the Knighton, for Messrs. Jas. Duncan & Co, with a varied cargo of pine and hardwoods.\nMessrs. Wm. Stewart & Co. exposed for sale, at the Burgh Saw-mills, on Tuesday last, an assortment of deals, battens, flooring, lining, &c.; also a large quantity of cut yellow pine.\nThe attendance was the poorest that has been seen for some time, few of the trade being present.\nThe quantity of stuff sold was by no means great, while the prices were extremely poor, this being particularly the case with the cut yellow pine, which went as low as 1d. for ¾ in. average.\nTaking the pine from first to last it was by no means first class; still 1¼d. to 1½d. can hardly have been a remunerative price for ¾ in. average.\nBut few deals and battens were sold, except job lots; indeed it may be questioned if there were buyers present to buy at any price, however low.\nThe following is a note of prices:—\n11 x 3 1st white St. Petersburg deals, 3½d. lin. ft.\n7 x 2½ 1st red Kotka battens, 1¾d. per lin. foot\nYellow pine deals, 3rds, 14d. and 14½d. cubic ft.\n¾ white sarking, 7½d. per superficial yard\n¾ white lining, 7½d. „\n1½ 1st St. Petersburg white flooring, 13d. sup. yd.\n¾ 1st St. Petersburg in. average, 1½d. to 1¾d. per sup. foot\n¾ of Birch, in. average, 1½d. to 1¾d. „\nYellow pine „ 1½d. to 1¾d. „\nAsh, ¾ in. and ½ in., 1¾d. „\nAt Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co.'s sale on Thursday almost nothing was done, as the exposers refused to come below a limit, only a few lots of square pine being sold at 2s., and two lots of pitch pine at 16½d.\nNotwithstanding the discouraging result above stated, a number of sales are advertised for the next few weeks.\n\nMAHOGANY AND HARDWOODS.\nWeekly Statement of the Landings, Stocks, and Deliveries of Furniture, &c., Woods at the Port of London.\n[table start]\n| | Landed week ending Aug. 20. | Total deliveries week ending Aug. 20. | Stock on Aug. 20, 1881. | Stock on the corresponding period of 1880.\n|---|---|---|---|---\n| Mahog., Hndrs., logs | — | 300 | 1,409 | 2,073\n| Mexico „ | — | 174 | 2,541 | 1,709\n| St. Domingo „ | — | 282 | 880 | 1,228\n| Cuba „ | — | 199 | 3,854 | 3,077\n| Other Cntries. „ | — | — | 1 | 15\n| Cedar, Honduras „ | — | 53 | 438 | 234\n| Mexico „ | — | — | 1 | 129\n| Cuba „ | — | 1 | 136 | 7\n| New S.
