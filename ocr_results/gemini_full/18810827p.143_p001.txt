fine condition, and quality very superior.
Stocks do not appear to increase, although the imports are heavy, most goods apparently going forward into consumption direct.
Prices remain in much the same condition, if any change it is upwards, and with the prospect of heavier insurances and freights prices are firm, and likely to remain so.
Mr. John Bowman, timber merchant of the town, having added the business of auctioneering to his former occupation, made his debut as a knight of the hammer on Tuesday last.
The cargo operated upon was a parcel of Tornea deals 9 & 11 x 3.
Mr. Bowman had a fair audience to witness his maiden effort, and the bulk of the goods found purchasers at a price about £8 to £8 15s. per standard, quality described as 70 per cent. 1st, and 30 per cent. 2nds.
A sale of American wainscot logs and planks, just landed per steamer from America, is announced for Wednesday next by Messrs. Atkinson & Garland.
The arrivals by steamers from America to Tyne are now bringing forward sundry descriptions of wood goods, such as doors, mouldings, staves for casks ready for use, planks of various furniture woods, &c., which are coming into competition with the home manufacture, and appear to carry the palm against them.

GLASGOW.
Imports of foreign timber to the Clyde during the past week have been to the extent of about 5,000 loads, consisting of two cargoes teak, one of Quebec timber and deals, and several parcels of wainscot billets, American and Italian walnut, &c.
The tonnage employed for the conveyance of teak imported to Clyde since beginning of the year aggregates 7,819 tons, being rather more than for corresponding period of 1880.
The last arrivals this year were in March.
There has been a falling off in the imports of birch this year, the arrivals from Quebec and lower ports amounting to 5,000 logs, as against 8,000 last year at corresponding date.
A public sale was held here on 23rd inst. by Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co., brokers.
The goods offered consisting chiefly of New Brunswick spruce deals and Picton, N.S., birch timber.
The attendance was good, and a fair portion of the catalogue was disposed of at following rates:—Pictou birch timber, about 500 logs sold, one page of 21 logs, average 17¼ in. square (some logs figured), at 1s. 7½d. per cubic foot, string measure, the remainder, say from 15 in. to 16 in. average square, at from 1s. 2½d. to 1s. 4d. per cubic foot.
A parcel of 39 logs American black walnut (round), from 10 to 19 in. girth, sold at from 2s. 7d. to 4s. 11½d. per cubic foot, string measure, average 3s. 5½d.
For lower port deals suitable for staging, planks, box-making, &c., a fair demand still continues; over 20,000 pieces were sold, rates as undernoted:—

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.

LEITH.
The list of arrivals shows the imports for the last seven days to include 62,443 pieces deals and battens, a few parcels lathwood, and one arrival from Quebec, viz., the Knighton, for Messrs. Jas. Duncan & Co, with a varied cargo of pine and hardwoods.
Messrs. Wm. Stewart & Co. exposed for sale, at the Burgh Saw-mills, on Tuesday last, an assortment of deals, battens, flooring, lining, &c.; also a large quantity of cut yellow pine.
The attendance was the poorest that has been seen for some time, few of the trade being present.
The quantity of stuff sold was by no means great, while the prices were extremely poor, this being particularly the case with the cut yellow pine, which went as low as 1d. for ¾ in. average.
Taking the pine from first to last it was by no means first class; still 1¼d. to 1½d. can hardly have been a remunerative price for ¾ in. average.
But few deals and battens were sold, except job lots; indeed it may be questioned if there were buyers present to buy at any price, however low.
The following is a note of prices:—
11 x 3 1st white St. Petersburg deals, 3½d. lin. ft.
7 x 2½ 1st red Kotka battens, 1¾d. per lin. foot
Yellow pine deals, 3rds, 14d. and 14½d. cubic ft.
¾ white sarking, 7½d. per superficial yard
¾ white lining, 7½d. „
1½ 1st St. Petersburg white flooring, 13d. sup. yd.
¾ 1st St. Petersburg in. average, 1½d. to 1¾d. per sup. foot
¾ of Birch, in. average, 1½d. to 1¾d. „
Yellow pine „ 1½d. to 1¾d. „
Ash, ¾ in. and ½ in., 1¾d. „
At Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co.'s sale on Thursday almost nothing was done, as the exposers refused to come below a limit, only a few lots of square pine being sold at 2s., and two lots of pitch pine at 16½d.
Notwithstanding the discouraging result above stated, a number of sales are advertised for the next few weeks.
