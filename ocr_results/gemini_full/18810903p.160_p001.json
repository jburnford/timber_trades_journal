Owing to the light importation this season stocks are getting considerably reduced, though they are still quite sufficient for the demand. Notwithstanding the advance in the price of goods for shipment, and the consequent impossibility of replacing stocks at the same rate as formerly, the merchants in this district find it impossible to obtain any corresponding advance from consumers. Public sales are still as numerous as before; there seems now to exist, however, a growing tendency to hold out for a reasonable limit, which cannot be said to have been the case before.\nMessrs. Mitchell, Somers and Co. exposed for sale by public auction, on the Queen's Dock, on Tuesday, a varied assortment of deals and battens. The attendance was very good, more especially taking into account the fact that the material on stand was composed of the late royal review was to be offered for sale on Thursday, and that Messrs. James Duncan & Co. have a sale of yellow pine on Tuesday first. Bidding cannot be said to have been very brisk, yet a pretty good quantity of stuff was cleared out from beginning to end at fair prices. The quantity sold might have been considerably greater, but the auctioneer in many instances did not press for bids below a limit. The following is a note of prices:—\n6½ x 2½ Narva 3rd red, 1 5/8d. per lin. ft.\n6½ x 2½ 3rd white battens, 1 3/8d. „\n6½ x 2½ Sundswal 1 3rd white battens, 1 3/8d. „\n6 x 2½ „ 2nd „ 1 1/4d. „\n11 x 3 3rd yellow pine deals, 1 3/4d. per cub. ft.\nMessrs. James Duncan & Co. have a sale of American pine deals, battens, &c., announced for Tuesday first, in their yards, Assembly Street and Seafield.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADE OF MOBILE.\nMR. CRIDLAND, the British Consul at Mobile, reports that during 1880 there was a very decided improvement in all the branches of the pitch pine timber trade, both in the United States and in foreign countries. This may be accounted for by the gradual return of prosperity in every department of business, both in America and in Europe, though the timber trade is generally the last to feel beneficial changes. Early in the year the available supply of timber in this district, fit for shipment, was scarce, consequently high prices prevailed among the woodcutters—higher than had been paid for several years past. This condition of the market here induced many persons who had almost abandoned the business to recommence, and in consequence the supply of timber at this port during the last six months of 1880 increased to such an extent as to make the same larger than for years past, and the entire trade larger than it had been for many seasons, and the reports confirm the impression that there will be a large trade in 1881 and profitable to all those engaged in it in this district.\nProbably the cause which for years past has operated against Mobile being a timber port on a large scale has been the fact that the entire mercantile community was under the impression that nothing would be profitable outside the cotton trade with all its ramifications, but the loss of such a large portion of that trade to Mobile has compelled the population to go into other industries, and the employment of so many hands in the timber business has aroused them to the fact that there is employment for a large number of persons and also profit, and steady work all the year round.\n\nREMOVING A BUILDING.—The most startling rumour in the Catskills recently is that the owner of the Hotel Kaaterskill contemplates the removal of one of the large Centennial buildings at Philadelphia by canal boat, and up the Catskill to the crest of the famous High Peak, where he will transform it into a summer hotel.—New York Estate Record.\n\nTHE POLYTECHNIC.—This old institution of \"science and amusement\" will finally close its doors on September 10th. A full programme of varieties is being executed; a lecture on \"The New Forest,\" and another on \"Bulgaria and its People,\" will be both interesting and instructive.\nMESSRS. W. H. & L. COLLINGRIDGE, of the City Press, announce the completion and occupation of their new buildings, 148 and 149, Aldersgate Street, which have been erected upon the site of the offices destroyed by fire in April of last year.\n\nIMPORTS.\n[For the purpose of economizing space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.—ED.]\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nABERYSTWITH.\nAug. 25 St. Clemens-Uleaborg-4,316 deals and battens-Ellis & Jones\nAnne Jane-Miramichi-4,604 deals and battens-Griffith Williams\n\nBARROW.\nAug. 24 Schelde-Sheet Harbour-26,326 deals, boards, &c.-Wm.
