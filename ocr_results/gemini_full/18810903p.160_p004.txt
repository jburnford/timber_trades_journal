A letter received: "Gentlemen,-It may, perhaps, interest you to know that, after an extended trial, I have found your Glycerine Jujubes of considerable benefit (with or without medical treatment) in almost all forms of throat disease. They soften and clear the voice. -Yours faithfully, GORDON HOLMES, L.R.C.P.E., Senior Physician to the Municipal Throat and Ear Infirmary."-Advt.
