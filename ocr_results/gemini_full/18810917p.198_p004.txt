THROAT IRRITATION.—Soreness and dryness,
tickling and irritation, inducing cough and affect-
ing the voice. For these symptoms use Epps's
Glycerine Jujubes. Glycerine, in these agreeable
confections, being in proximity to the glands at
the moment they are excited by the act of sucking,
becomes actively healing. Sold only in boxes, 7½d.
and 1s. 1½d., labelled “JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœo-
pathic Chemists, London.” A letter received:
“Gentlemen,—It may, perhaps, interest you to
know that, after an extended trial, I have found your
Glycerine Jujubes of considerable benefit (with or
without medical treatment) in almost all forms of
throat disease. They soften and clear the voice.
—Yours faithfully, GORDON HOLMES, L.R.C.P.E.,
Senior Physician to the Municipal Throat and Ear
Infirmary.”—Advt.

CASUALTIES.
The barque Fauna (of Dram), from Sundswall
to Boulogne, with timber, has stranded on Gunfleet
Sand. Crew landed at Harwich. Vessel water-
logged, and fore and main masts and rudder and
sternpost gone. Unsuccessful attempts made to
float her.
The Louise (of Barth), from Dantzic with tim-
ber, arrived at Wisbech on Friday last, heeled
over at midnight, and filled with water, and on
Saturday had 10 ft. of water in her. The accident
was caused by the vessel being moored too near
the bank.
The British barque Abram Young, from New
Brunswick with timber, arrived at Bordeaux
recently after being ashore in the river Gironde.
