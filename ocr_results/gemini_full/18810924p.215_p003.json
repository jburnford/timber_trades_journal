This rise in freights has now reached 17s. 6d. to 20s. per standard over rates which same vessels were secured at in the summer. From the Canadian ports chartering is almost at a standstill on this side, and Quebec rates still remain low for spot vessels. From the pitch pine ports tonnage is still being fixed at 37s. 6d. hewn timber and 115s. sawn timber from Pensacola, and 36s. hewn timber and 112s. 6d. sawn timber from Doboy, for a full range of ports, orders, on signing bills of lading.\n\nAnnexed are current quotations :—\nGefle or District to London, 47s. 6d. deals and battens.\n„ to London, 42s. 6d. to 45s deals.\n„ „ 52s. 6d. firewood.\n„ Gloucester, 52s. 6d. deals.\n„ Hobson’s Bay, £4 17s. 6d.\nSoderhamn to London, 47s. 6d. deals.\n„ Portsmouth, 40s. to 42s. 6d. deals.\nSundswall to London, 47s. 6d. deals.\n„ Appledore Pool, 57s. 6d. timber.\n„ Dundee, 45s. timber.\n„ Yarmouth, 50s. deals.\nBjorneborg to London, 50s. deals.\nHernösand to London, 50s. deals.\n„ Tyne, 40s.\n„ Dunkirk, 61 fcs. and 5 per cent. deals.\nDrammen to Thames, 32s. 6d. staves.\nKotka to London, 52s. 6d. and 55s. firewood.\nWyburg to London, 52s. 6d. and 55s. firewood.\n„ Ipswich 55s.\n„ Lynn, 45s.\nBorga to Grimsby, 40s. deals.\nPernaviken to Grangemouth, 40s.\nLjusne to Wisbech, 55s.\nCronstadt to Yarmouth, 42s. 6d.\nUllanger to London, 45s. to 47s. 6d. deals.\nMemel to London, 11s. and 12s. fir sleepers.\nNordmaling to Calais, 62 fcs. and 5 per cent. deals.\nLanget p.
