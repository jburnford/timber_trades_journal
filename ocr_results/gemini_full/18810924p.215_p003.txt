SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
FREIGHTS.
During the past week there has been a further rise in freights from the Baltic, 50s. having been paid for deals from the lower Swedish ports to London for steamers, which is the highest rate that has been paid this season, and we hear of some boats still holding out for 52s. 6d.; and notwithstanding the frequent expression made use of by merchants, “unless tonnage can be secured at their rates they will let the goods remain unshipped” that has hardly been adhered to this fall. This rise in freights has now reached 17s. 6d. to 20s. per standard over rates which same vessels were secured at in the summer. From the Canadian ports chartering is almost at a standstill on this side, and Quebec rates still remain low for spot vessels. From the pitch pine ports tonnage is still being fixed at 37s. 6d. hewn timber and 115s. sawn timber from Pensacola, and 36s. hewn timber and 112s. 6d. sawn timber from Doboy, for a full range of ports, orders, on signing bills of lading.

PENSACOLA.—Messrs. Hyer Brothers, in their circular dated August 31st, report as follows :—
“Since date of our last there has been but little activity in freight engagements, owing chiefly to the scarcity of tonnage offering, and we have consequently but few engagements to report.
Freights to United Kingdom and Continent for ready vessels can still be quoted at 40s. and £6 ; coastwise, 9·50 dols.; to Cuba some falling off in rates is apparent, and we cannot now quote above 11·50 dols. to 12 dols. as current for North Side. Engagements for coming season are being made in Europe at 38s. and £5 17s. 6d.”
