Sutherland\nSHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\nFREIGHTS.\nFreights have during the last few days shown a downward tendency, consequent apparently upon there having been a fair supply of spot steamers, who, having taken coals to Cronstadt, have had no option, but in taking the best home-ward employment from neighbouring localities. Thus we hear of a steamer having been closed at 45s. from the lower Baltic, whereas a few days previously 50s. had been paid. Against this 45s., however, we have to mention that Messrs. C. & C. J. Northcote have since fixed a steamer from Gefle district to London at 50s., so that, although easier in tone, it hardly appears probable that any permanent fall need be reckoned upon.\nRegarding freights for the smaller outports, these are very firm at remunerative figures, but it is more than doubtful if a sufficiency of tonnage will be forthcoming thus late in the season to lift more than a portion of what is required.\nThe following are current quotations:—\nOxelosund to London, 40s. to 42s. 6d. deals.\nGefle to London, 45s. deals.\n„ Gloucester, 52s. 6d and 55s.\n„ London, 53s. 9d. firewood.\nNorrsundet to London, 47s. 6d. deals.\nSoderhamn to London, 47s. 6d. deals.\nSundswall to London, 47s. 6d. deals.\n„ Dundee, 45s. to 47s. 6d. timber.\n„ Truro, 55s. deals and timber.\nNy Carleby to London, 47s. 6d. to 50s. deals.\nKotka to London, 53s. 9d. firewood.\nWyborg to London, 55s. firewood.\n„ Hull, 42s. 6d. deals.\nHernosand to Hull, 45s. deals.\nMemel to Newport, 12s. sleepers.\n„ London, 11s. sleepers.\n„ Grimsby, 10s. sleepers.\n„ Sunderland, 9s. sleepers.\nFredrikstad to London, 27s. 6d. flooring.\n„ Liverpool, 35s. flooring.\nQUEBEC.—The Quebec Chronicle of Sept. 15th reports that five hundred and fifty-seven sea-going vessels have been entered at the Custom House since the opening of navigation.

[?]\n\n[OCTOBER 1, 1881.]\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\nTAYLOR, PHILLIP.—On Saturday last, Mr. Taylor, builder, of Hampstead, filed his petition in the Bankruptcy Court, discharge in this case being opposed on the ground that his expenses were not sufficient to meet the claims of his creditors. The debtor, Victor [?] of 133, Great [?] Street, Vauxhall, and of [?] saw mill proprietor, last [?] filed his petition in [?] and his affairs disclose liabilities £[?],136 10s., assets £987 11s. 10d. The estate should pay 20s. in the £. Mr. Alley, who appeared for the [?] was heard against the [?] of the case [?] St. Dunstan's [?] scheme of arrangement [?] of creditors [?] was confirmed at a meeting held last week. The resolutions of the creditors were registered on the 12th in pursuance of an order of the court. The debts were to be paid in full by three instalments of 6s. 8d. in the £, at four, eight, and twelve months, within three days from the date of the registration order, and the debtor was to give security for the last two instalments. The debtor was called in the examination and the assets as set forth in the statement (without allowing for depreciation) were sufficient to show that the estate would provide a dividend of that amount. It was also certified that after payment of all preferential claims the estate would in all probability realise 20s. in the £. Mr. Burner appeared in support of the application. After some discussion, in the absence of any substantial opposition, the arrangement was confirmed, and the serious illness of the debtor was held to be a sufficient excuse for his failure to see the eighteen creditors who had not signed.\nTHOMAS HAYES.—The first meeting of the creditors of Thomas Hayes, of Andwick, slater and builder, was held at the King's Arms read a statement of affairs showing liabilities £202, and assets £202. No resolution was come to, and the debtor was left in the hands of the receiver and the joint trustees.\nGEORGE MIDDLEWOOD.—At a meeting of creditors by arrangement of George Middlewood, of Moss Side, Manchester, builder, whose liabilities were stated at £5,000, with assets £2,000, it was resolved to wind up the estate in liquidation.\nROBERT WHITE.—The first meeting of the creditors of Robert White, of [?] Street, Sheffield, was held last week. The liabilities £6,000, assets £2,000. It was resolved to liquidate.\nJ. J. EVETTS.—The first meeting of the creditors of J. J. Evetts, of Seymour, builder, was held in the Bankruptcy Court, Cork, on the 12th inst. The liabilities were stated at £5,673, with assets £1,000. This was the first sitting.

Eustace and Co., having a claim of £1,000; Mr. Hegarty, porter merchant, £1,000; and Mr. Evans, London, £1,000. The appointment of Mr. Sealey, of Bandon, as creditors' assignee was not confirmed.\nLIST OF VESSELS BOUND TO THE UNITED KINGDOM.\nDATE. VESSEL. FROM.
