On 5th inst., at Glasgow, Messrs. Farnworth & Jardine, of Liverpool, brokers :—
A cargo of mahogany from Santa Ana, consisting of 411 logs, 148,669 sale ft., brought 6½d. per ft. average, prices ranging from 5½d. to 10d. ; 77 log ends sold at 4½d. to 5d., and 4 logs cedar at 4d. per ft.

LEITH.
The imports are again very light at this port, consisting chiefly of a cargo of deals and battens from Drammen and one from Cronstadt. The Adriatic has also arrived from Quebec with a cargo of yellow pine, ash, oak, &c., for Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co. Business in this district is inclined to be quiet, with little sign of an immediate briskness.
No public sales have taken place during the past week, and only one has up till now been announced for the current month.

THE WRECK REGISTER.
We always regret to have to record maritime disasters, but as the number of ships employed in the timber trade is so great this Journal is bound to notice shipping misfortunes, and they seem to be constantly on the increase. No less than 28 shipwrecks were reported last week, making a total of 1,211 for the present year, or an increase of 281 as compared with the corresponding period of last year. The approximate value of the property lost was £5,000,000, including British £4,000,000. Seven vessels were lost off the coasts of the United Kingdom, three were abandoned at sea, two sunk by collision, two were lost off Australia, and one was destroyed by fire. The lives lost and missing numbered about 45, but we are not aware that among the latter were any for which a timber-laden vessel was accountable.

THE OUTPUT OF IRON.
It is hard to reconcile with the alleged prosperity of the iron trade a diminution of the number of furnaces allowed to be kept in blast. We are told that work was resumed in all the great Scotch ironmaking establishments on the 3rd inst. with only 105 furnaces in blast, against 121 last week; the reduction of 16 being in accordance with the agreement made at the conference last month with the Cleveland ironmasters.
If we had been informed that they were putting out some of Herr Krupp's furnaces at Essen, or that some Belgian iron works were being discontinued, or that Pittsburg was blowing out a portion of its fires, we should not regard it as a sign of good times in those districts. There is no doubt, however, that prices are better, with an upward tendency. Possibly the arrangement for diminishing the supply has itself augmented the demand, it would do so in the timber trade, but the limitation of the supply is not so obvious and self-evident as in the iron production.
