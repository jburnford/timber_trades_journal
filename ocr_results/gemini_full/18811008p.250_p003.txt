MAHOGANY AND HARDWOODS.
On Thursday, at the Mincing Lane Salerooms, Messrs. Thos. EDWARDS & SON submitted the cargo of mahogany ex Virgen del Carmen from Truxillo. There was a capital attendance, and all the lots were disposed of without difficulty at capital prices.
Following the above Messrs. GEO. SHADBOLT & SON submitted a somewhat varied assortment of mahogany and walnutwood, only a portion of which, however, was sold. One buyer secured

[OCTOBER 8, 1881.
220 pieces of the cargo of St. Jago de Cuba mahogany, which does not appear to be of the kind that the market requires. There do not seem anything fresh to report previously offered.
Messrs. EDWARD & SON's sale, as per circular dated 29th ult., is postponed.
Mahogany.—St. Domingo is in good request, and fresh supplies of large sizes, of good lengths and widths, would realize very fair rates, whilst small wood is of high value. We quote large logs, from 3 to 5 ft. long, at 10d. to 1s. 6d. There has been little inquiry for Honduras, and Cuba has been in poor demand, and low prices were obtained for the cargo sold on 22nd inst. Honduras.—There is a good demand, and the market is bare of supplies. Cortes, to be sold on 12th inst., will, no doubt, realize good prices. Mexican.—Tabasco met with a dull sale, and yielded very low prices. There is a light stock on hand. Minatitlan.—There has been without supplies for several months, and as there are no immediate prospects of any, prices are firm, and there is a fair inquiry for fresh wood of good dimensions.
Cedar.—For Honduras there is a fair demand, but the market is dull of sale.
Rosewood.—The recent arrivals from Bahia for the sale on 12th inst., with prompt sale, will probably meet with a good demand.
Zebrawood.—The cargo which arrived the past fortnight will be brought to public sale.
Satinwood is in good demand.
The stock is exhausted, and there is nothing to report.
TEAK MARKET.
Messrs. Denny, Mott, & Dickson inform us that there is little fresh feature in this market. In response to the facts reported in our issue of 1st inst., prices in Burmah continue firm, whilst considerable deliveries continue to be made from landed stocks in London, and a large floating cargo, just arrived and intended for London has been diverted to an outport.
