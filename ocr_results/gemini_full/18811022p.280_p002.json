Mulford Bros., timber merchants, Southampton, and close to the Northam Railway Station, on Tuesday evening week. It was discovered in a shop where felloes, spokes, and such like are made, and this building being constructed of timber of a very inflammable nature it was soon in flames. Although three powerful engines were worked incessantly, the flames spread from Messrs. Mulford's place to the adjoining yard of Mr. John Crook, contractor and builder, and got hold of a shed or shop in which were ladders and other materials, and then spread to the blacksmith's shop, which was entirely gut'ed. It being evidently no use to try and subdue the fire, then raging fiercely, efforts were made to confine it and endeavour to save the adjoining property. Had there been any wind, no doubt the fire would have extended to the bark ricks, wooden sheds, and the timber in Messrs. Mulford's yard, but fortunately there was no wind, and thus much valuable property was saved. The fire was not got under for two hours, and not without considerable damage having been done. The origin of the fire is unknown. Messrs. Mulford are insured in the Queen Office, and Mr. Crook in the Queen and Atlas Offices, but the insurance will not cover the loss the latter has sustained.\n\n281\nSHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\nFREIGHTS.\nThere is, comparatively speaking, no timber chartering from Canada and the Baltic for the year, and, although we hear of a stray vessel or so being loaded from the Gulf of Bothnia, the rates are so fluctuating that quotations are almost useless. From Frederikstadt there is a fair demand for tonnage at last quotations, and pitch pine rates remain stationary.\nSt. John, N.B. - Mr. J. I. Woodworth writes as follows under date the 7th inst.:-The large number of vessels loading on the St. John in order to secure their deckloads, has greatly reduced our fleet, as well as exhausted our stock of deals. With regard to the latter we think that the coming winter will find us in the smallest stock that we have held for more than a quarter of a century.\nThe freight market is very quiet; the last transact on reported was 57s. 6d. for Liverpool or Bristol Channel.\nFOREIGN CLEARANCES.\nQUEBEC.-Sept. 29th, Heimdal, London, 12,500 pcs. spruce deals, 6 m. pipe staves, 17 do. elm, 60 Althild, Truro, 31 pcs. oak, 51 do. birch, 14 do. red pine, 422 do. white pine, 10 do. ash, 8 do. walnut 1,000 pine deals, 13,200 WOWI do. ; Active, Bristol, 124 pcs. oak, 31 do. walnut, 1,027 do. elm, 1,511 do. deals, 290 do. ends, 11 cords lathwood ; Lady Rowena, Liverpool, 127 pcs. oak, 754 do. waney pine, 1,000 pine deals, 4,437 pipe staves ; Benefactor, Liverpool, 124 pcs. oak, 116 do. elm, 452 do. waney white pine, 157 do. birch, 14 do. chestnut, 122 do. maple, 50 do. sycamore, 3,518 pine deals, 5,579 WOWI staves ; James, Liverpool, 54 waney white pine, 57 do. birch, 2,100 pine deals, 1,300 do. do. ends, 1,911 do. do. ends, 100 do. staves ; Arran, London, 2,750 pine deals, Glenhaven, Cardiff, 84 pcs. oak, 589 do. white pine, 14,400 cords lathwood ; Betsy & Ann, Bristol, 111 pcs. oak, 15 do. elm, 341 do. red pine, 250 do. birch, 11,047 pine deals, 3,850 do. boards, 2,250 pipe staves ; Titania, Troon, 22 pcs. oak, 6 do. elm, 401 do. white pine, 15 do. red pine, 1,415 pine deals, 385 do. ends ; Lanarkshire, London, 16,258 pcs. pine deals, do. cherry, 220 pcs. birch, 15,000 spruce deals, 1,000 do. ends, 1,900 stds. staves ; Unto, Sharpness, 42 pcs. oak, 65 do. birch, 12 do. elm, 25 do.
