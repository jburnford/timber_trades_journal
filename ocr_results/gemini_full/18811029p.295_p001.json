  "text": "glad to say the crew were all saved by means of the rocket wood goods.\nFor sawn goods the demand is still quiet, and, as there are so few ships discharging, there is consequently not much work doing on the quayside, whilst from the stocks in yard the demand appears even less than was the case last week. Towards the close of the season there is usually a little business in exporting going on, and this has been noticeable during the last few days; coastwise we notice Messrs. Hy. Sheraton & Co. have despatched a cargo of deals to Sutton Bridge, whilst amongst the exports foreign, the ss. *Lizzie English* has taken on board for Bombay a cargo of 25,000 sleepers creosoted, the estimated quantity being 1,352 loads and valued at upwards of £4,000.\n\nTYNE.\nThere have been a considerable number of arrivals during the last seven days, a great many vessels having suffered terribly in the gales of the 21st inst. while crossing the North Sea. A good deal of damage is reported, deckloads lost, &c., and some amount of anxiety is felt for several large timber-laden vessels which are a good deal overdue. The weather has interfered sadly with all outdoor occupations, and many contracts have been at a standstill. It is hoped that with a favourable autumn a great amount of work may yet be accomplished, as heavy contracts are still in hand.\nSome Quebec ships are getting a good deal overdue, and, although some are in trouble, the fate of others intended for the Tyne is still a matter of uncertainty. Prices of these goods are well maintained, more especially in yellow pine timber. Deals are a slow sale, and prices no easier.\nIn redwood deals there is but little change to note; although prices are firm, by the not upward tendency shown by the London market, and buyers are difficult to educate up to the advanced prices.\nPitwood is still increasing in stock, but the largest merchants here are holding for advanced rates.\n\nCARDIFF.\n(By Telegraph.)\nA cargo of pitch pine, ex *Filippo Padre*, from Pensacola, was offered for sale, without reserve, on the Gantry, East Moor, on Thursday last, by the Liverpool firm, Messrs. Alfred Dobell & Co. The following are particulars of prices realized :—\nHewn—118 ft. average 1s. 6½d. per cub. ft.\n„ 114 „ „ 1s. 6d. „ „\n„ 109 „ „ 1s. 3d. „ „\n„ 105 „ „ 1s. 3½d. „ „\n„ 104 „ „ 1s. 2½d. „ „\n„ 87 „ „ 1s. 2d. „ „\n„ 79 „ „ 1s. 1½d. „ „\n„ 77 „ „ 1s. 2d. „ „\n„ 64 „ „ 1s. 5½d. „ „\nSawn— 50 „ „ 1s. 2½d. „ „\n„ 43 „ „ 1s. 2½d. „ „\n„ 42 „ „ 1s. 1d. to 1s. 2½d. „ „\n„ 19 to 40 „ „\nDeals—£9 9s. 1d. to £9 19s. 4d. per standard.\nEnds—£7 14s. 8d.\n\nGLASGOW.\nThere has been no addition to stocks of wood goods at any of the Clyde ports during the past week, with the exception of a few deals and staves per steam liners; and at Grangemouth there has also been a very small import for this time of the year. From all that can be gathered, it appears that any further imports to Clyde markets this year will be light. Quebec papers just received show no vessels loading for this port, and with reference to the Quebec trade it is stated that the season is fast drawing to a close. In these circumstances the position of the trade with regard to both buyer and seller can now be pretty accurately realized. A statement was given last week of the stocks on hand, showing that the market is in general fairly well supplied.\nThe tonnage employed for the conveyance of wood goods from Quebec to Clyde this year amounts till date to 63,500 tons, as against 68,200 for corresponding period 1880. From New Brunswick ports and Nova Scotia the aggregate tonnage employed this year is 27,000 tons, as against 24,000 for 1880. For the conveyance of pitch pine the tonnage employed this year amounts to a large total of 46,800 tons, showing a great increase over previous year.\nThe importation of mahogany to this port, so far as the year has advanced, shows considerably under that of last year, the tonnage employed being as follows:—For 1881, 2,220 tons; for 1880 (corresponding period), 3,272 tons. There is no mahogany in stock here, but supplies are understood to be close at hand.\nThe deliveries of deals during September and October amount to 220,000 pieces from the Sawmill Yards, apart from what has been delivered from yards at Greenock and Port Glasgow. A fair consumption is indicated, but on account of the long-continued depressed condition of the housebuilding trade it is found that Quebec pine deals, of average sizes, are exceedingly difficult to move off at satisfactory rates, especially best qualities.\nA few weeks ago an official statement was published as to the amount of building in the city. The estimated amount for the year then ending was £307,640. Three years ago the estimated value was £755,000; four years ago it was £357,119; one year further back the amount was £431,000. These four years added together amount to £1,850,759, or considerably less than the single year 1876, when the value of the buildings amounted to £2,125,000. It was thought that three years of depression would probably be sufficient to atone for the undue amount of building speculation in previous years, but, as shown by the above figures for the last year, this anticipation has not been realized.\n\nLEITH.\nA good number of timber-laden vessels have arrived here during the past week, the importation of deals and battens from various Baltic ports amounting to 86,949 pieces, besides some large parcels of staves, lathwood, &c. No public sales have been held within the last seven days, merchants, in view of the comparatively light stocks and present upward tendency of the market, preferring to hold on in hopes of better prices during the winter. Owing to the light demand an advance in prices is only obtained from consumers with great difficulty. The building trade remains very dull indeed; in fact, little new work of any importance is at present going on.\nOn Saturday last a fire occurred at Messrs. Dow & Co.’s saw-mills, Grangemouth, resulting in the destruction of the engine-house and mill. The stock was, however, but slightly injured, the damage done being covered by insurance.\n\nNEW POST AND TELEGRAPH REGULATIONS.\nThe Postmaster-General has given notice that on and after the 1st November the use of distinctive telegraph stamps will be discontinued, and postage stamps of all amounts, including the penny postage and inland revenue stamp, will be available for the payment of telegraph charges. This measure will facilitate the posting of telegrams in letter boxes during the night, or where there is no telegraph office within a convenient distance, as telegrams thus posted will be conveyed, without extra charge, at the next collection of letters, to the nearest telegraph office which is open, for the purpose of being transmitted by the wires at the earliest possible moment. In those cases in which difficulty would be experienced in obtaining a printed telegraph message form ordinary paper may be used. The message may, or may not, at the option of the sender, be enclosed in an envelope, but if an envelope is used it must be marked “telegram, immediate.” The stock of telegraph stamps and stamped telegraph forms in the hands of the public may still be used for telegraph purposes, but not for postage or inland revenue payments.\nThese are concessions to public convenience which will no doubt be appreciated, and, while they are yet unfamiliar, a copy of the new rules might with advantage be fixed up in every office for the guidance of clerks and assistants, without troubling their principals with inquiries when information on the subject is needed. The permission to put telegrams in the post-office to be forwarded on first collection without charge is something entirely new, and will be useful when the last night mail has been missed.\n\nIMPORTS.\n[For the purpose of economizing space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing it can be saved.—ED.]\n\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nBARROW.\nOct. 18 Tremad-Harbour-13,995 deals, battens and ends-Price, Potter, & Co.\nGlen Monarch-Quebec-167 pcs. oak hewn, 20 pcs. yellow pine hewn, 8,046 deals and ends-Price, Potter, & Co.\nBrothers-Yarmouth, N.B.-14,816 deals and ends-Price, Potter, & Co.\n19 Birgatte-Bathurst-105,588 boards-J.
