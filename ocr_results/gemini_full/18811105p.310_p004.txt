SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
FREIGHTS.
The late reports from the north of Europe, advising the setting in of winter, have caused almost a complete secession of business in chartering from this direction for any but spot tonnage, although there are steamer quotations from Dantzic, as under :-
Antwerp } Oak half-round sleepers, 25s. per load.
Ostend }
Boulogne }
Calais } Sq. and for half-sq. sleepers, 25s. per ld.
Boulogne }
Dunkirk }
From Norway the demand for tonnage has somewhat quieted off, although it is still probable 32s. 6d. can be obtained for London, from Frederickstadt, for floorings and sawn wood, and Halifax there is still inquiry for ship-room for the United Kingdom, at 55s. to 57s. 6d. Pitch pine rates remain unchanged, with perhaps a slight weakening in tone.
The following wood freights are quoted :-
