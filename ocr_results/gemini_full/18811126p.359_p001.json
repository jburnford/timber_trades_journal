Price, Potter, Walker, & Co. have two cargoes at sea, that Messrs. Marshall & Atkinson have one, and that there may be another straggler or two yet to arrive.\nFor all practical purposes of comparison, however, it may be taken that the import season has closed.\nIt is now to be seen that the anticipations we have from time to time held out in our fortnightly notes, as to the comparative lightness of this season's importation, have to be regarded as concluded facts.\nAs a matter of course, the falling off in the import has been induced mainly by reason of the lessened business done by the two largest firms here.\nMerchants, when estimating the import of this season's import with that of others, will require to bear in mind that the item of sleepers in into Grimsby this year has been very large, and that a very large item of the computed number of loads must be reckoned to the account of sleepers.\nImporters have this year certainly been fortunate in the respect of having had their goods come forward for the greater part in most excellent condition.\nIncreased import ance appears to be now attached to the condition and clean appearance of sawn wood, a circumstance which has probably had its origin in the advantage which steamers in this respect have afforded over sailing vessels.\nThe trade in whitewood flooring boards at Grimsby has during recent times been on the decline, and but comparatively little of that class of stock is now held here.\nThe magnificent facilities with which the rival port of Hull is furnished for the economical preparing of flooring and other planed boards, equally by the number of public saw-mills and the low rates in vogue, appear to have drawn to that depot the bulk of the flooring trade.\nThe effect of the high freights upon the sleeper trade here has been most unfortunate to sellers.\nIt is said that the London and North-Western and other railway companies have recently had sleepers delivered to them, on account of early contracts, which have burdened the sellers with a loss of 4d. upon each sleeper delivered.\nThere has been received here this season a considerable importation of Stettin oak.\nIt may be remarked that, with the exception of a heavy line received by Messrs. Bennetts & Co., there have been but few Riga whitewood deals shipped this year to Grimsby.\nThere are no staves in Grimsby.\nIt is understood that the last parcel was cleared out at £240 per mille.\nWe have heard of £252 10s. having been recently demanded by a London house, and as this figure would, with the attachable contingencies, bring new imports up to something like £268 per mille, merchants will not be in a hurry to stock themselves.\nThere is not to be noticed any perceptible falling off in orders, and prices for all classes of stock are exceedingly firm.\nThe recent arrivals have been 366 loads of Ornskjoldsvik stock for Messrs. Bennetts & Co., 280 loads of the same stock for Mr. C. Tuplin, and 360 loads of Wifstawarf stock for Messrs. J. Chapman & Co.\n\nGLASGOW.\nDuring the past week there has been a very light import of wood woods to Clyde ports, viz., a small cargo of teak, one of greenheart, and some small lots of staves, &c., per steamer.\nNo public sales have been held by wood brokers here.\nTrade is steady, and meantime gives no indication of any sharp change for the winter months.\nAs to expected consumption the outlook generally is favourable, and, especially as regards shipbuilding, likely to continue so for some time.\nThe sale, however, of Canadian pine deals (best qualities), which used to go largely into consumption, has been slow throughout the season, and at present time gives no sign of a decided change for the better.\nBut it is observable that for some\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\ntime past there has been a marked restriction of the import of Quebec deals to Clyde.\nThe arrivals since the beginning of this month amount to only some 16,000 pieces, whereas the corresponding period last year shows 180,000 pieces imported.\nAs regards spruce deals, a small cargo from New Brunswick has just been discharged here, but apart from this and imports that have gone direct into consumers' hands there has been no other arrival of lower port spruce deals at Clyde ports for about six weeks.\nThe stock of this article being very light at present should have a hardening effect on prices.\nOf birch timber there is at present a very moderate supply on hand, but the demand is quiet.\nAmerican walnut is still in demand, especially of large sizes and good quality.\nThe import of mahogany up to date has been about equal to that of last year, the aggregate tonnage employed in conveyance being 3,200 tons.\nThere has been no arrival of pitch pine since the beginning of October, so that stocks have been considerably reduced of late.\n\nGEORGIAN TIMBER.\nWriting to a Pennsylvania paper, a correspondent remarks that there is at least half a million acres of timber in Georgia waiting for capital to bring it into market.\nA good deal of timber is being used for firewood or destroyed to make room for cotton fields.\nHe says:—To give some idea of the timber or wood resources of this great state let me give a description of some of the specimens of the woods of Georgia as exhibited at the Cotton Exposition.\nBlack or blue poplar, 54 in. in diameter; switch top hickory and white hickory, 10 and 15 in.; sycamore, 24 in.; beech, 24 in.; black walnut, 24 in.; spruce, 30 in.; Spanish oak, 38 in.; white oak, 38 in.; sweet gum tree, 24 in.; black gum, 18 in.; Tucaloo gum, 12 in.; persimmon, 12 in.\nBesides these we have the honey locust, mulberry, hawthorn, dogwood, sassafras, cottonwood, birch, maple, and other varieties of useful woods—enough to confirm my assertion that as a timber country Georgia has hidden in her forests untold millions of wealth waiting only to be developed and utilized by men of capital and energy.\nTake the one article of white oak staves, extensively used by brewers for the manufacture of large vats and hogsheads, and some idea may be formed of what could be done with the woods of Georgia.\nThis class of wood is to-day worth at Philadelphia from 75 dols. to 130 dols. per 1,200 staves, 54 in. long, 4 in. and 6 in. wide, and 1½ in. thick; while here the beautiful white oak trees, to clear to a height of 40 ft. to 60 ft., could be bought for 2 dols. apiece on the grounds.\nBesides this, white and yellow pine is abundant in an astonishing degree, and who has not heard of the quality of Georgia pine?\nI might also add a few other specimens on exhibition which struck me as interesting and peculiar.\nThey are wild cucumber wood, 10 in. in diameter; red ash, 13 in.; wild grape, 3 in.; laurel, 4 in.; alder, 3 in.; black jack, 15 in.; chestnut oak, 18 in.; and Turkey oak, 22 in.\n\nDIEPPE.—Thirty-two vessels entered this port during last month with timber cargoes, of which number eight were from Hernosand, six from Sundswall, three from Hudikswall, and the remainder from Marieberg, Fredrikshald, Nordmaling, Gefle, Stettin, Wyborg, &c.\nEMBEZZLEMENT.—At the West Hartlepool County Petty Sessions, Thomas Muirhead, a foreman joiner, in the employ of Messrs. Edward Withy & Co., of the Middleton Shipyard, has been sentenced to three months' hard labour for embezzling £1 18s., the property of his employers.\nTHE number of failures in England and Wales gazetted during the week ending November 19th was 229, of which the building trades formed 23, against 32 of a total of 250 failures in the corresponding week of 1880.\nThis shows a decrease of 9 in the building trades, or 21 in the total number. —*Kemp's Mercantile Gazette*.\nTHE ART OF TURNING.—We observe that among the papers to be read before the Society of Arts during the present session is one on \"The Art of Turning,\" by Mr. Paul N. Hasluck, whose \"Lathework,\" noticed in the *Timber Trades Journal* of April 30th last, will be familiar to our readers.\nMr. Hasluck's name is a sufficient guarantee that the subject will be ably and exhaustively treated.\n\n359\n\nIMPORTS.\n[For he purpose of economizing space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.—ED.]\n\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nBARNSTAPLE.\nERRATUM.\nAppledore-Sundswall-Nov. 1-for Alfred How & Co., read Alfred How & Co.\nBARROW.\nNov. 19 Buccleugh-Lules-4,243 pcs. fir hewn, 3,251 battens-F.
