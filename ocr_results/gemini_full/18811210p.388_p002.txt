FAILURE AT THE CAPE.-Telegrams from Cape Town announce the failure of Messrs. A. R. M'Kenzie & Co., an old-fashioned firm of contractors, with liabilities for £400,000. It is believed that, with careful realization, the assets will yield a satisfactory dividend.

THROAT IRRITATION.-Soreness and dryness, tickling and irritation, inducing cough and affecting the voice.
For these symptoms use Epps's Glycerine Jujubes.
Glycerine, in these agreeable confections, being in proximity to the glands at the moment they are excited by the act of sucking becomes actively healing.
Sold only in boxes, 7½d and 1s. 1½d., labelled "JAMES EPPS & Co., Homoeopathic Chemists, London."
A letter received: "Gentlemen,-It may, perhaps, interest you to know that, after an extended trial, I have found your Glycerine Jujubes of considerable benefit (with or without medical treatment) in almost all forms of throat disease.
They soften and clear the voice. -Yours faithfully, GORDON HOLMES, L.R.C.P.E., Senior Physician to the Municipal Throat and Ear Infirmary."-Advt.

THE WOOD BROKERS' MONTHLY CIRCULARS.
LONDON.
Messrs. CHURCHILL & SIM report, under date December 3rd, as follows:-A month ago severe frosts threatened to put an early close to the shipping season; they were, however, quickly succeeded by unusually mild weather, which has had the effect of keeping the navigation of Europe open until the present time; and the extent to which steamers have been employed to bring in supplies have worked a considerable change in the position of the market.
Towards the end of October, with many of the shipping ports already closing, and the dock companies holding in the yards and still to arrive about 5,000,000 of deals, battens, and boards less than last year, it appeared scarcely possible that the deficiency could in any way be made up; but so great an impulse has since been given to the importation that the stocks are now little more than 3,000,000 of pieces short, and with a fleet to arrive numbering 140 ships against 44 expected last December, it becomes doubtful whether the stocks at the end of the year will be materially less than at the commencement, declined under the pressure of this heavy autumn supply, and holders generally have displayed more anxiety to realize.

Messrs. SIMSON & MASON, in their circular, remark that the unexpected prolongation of the shipping season in the Baltic, on account of the mild weather, and consequent arrival of large numbers of steamers here during the last few weeks, combined with the forcing "without reserve" by some holders to secure profits, have tended to weaken prices, and at the present moment it does not seem probable that any considerable business will be done until January is over, although larger than the stocks then carried was expected a few weeks since, will doubtless be much below last year's figures, and when this fact is realized by buyers a firmer market may be established.

LIVERPOOL.
Messrs. DUNCAN, EWING & Co. state that a more satisfactory business has been done during the past month than has been experienced since the season commenced, and the stocks held over, with the exception of pitch pine, are in the aggregate much more moderate than they were at this period last year, whilst the consumption of square timber for the month is almost double that of November, 1880.

Messrs. JAS. SMITH & Co. report that the demand for the month has been somewhat checked by the advance in prices of most articles, and the continued firmness of holders, who are strengthened considerably by the moderate stocks, small import, and the large number of casualties caused by the late gales.
Trade generally throughout the country is better, but the prevailing complaint is that prices do not improve as quickly as was expected.
If shipments are kept moderate, a fair business may be realized during the winter.
Money continues firm, and the Bank rate is unchanged, ruling at 5 per cent.
Freights continue favourable to importers.

Messrs. DOBELL & Co. say that business has been of a satisfactory character.
The consumption generally has been good, and some descriptions of wood goods have improved in value.

Messrs. R. COLTART & Co. remark that the import has been quite maintained, while the consumption has been light, and prices have remained steady, while for some articles, such as Quebec goods, rather better prices have been obtainable.
It is to be noted that the entire Quebec fleet, with one or two exceptions, has now arrived, and as the stock of Quebec timber is not heavy, while values abroad have improved, sellers on this side are holding out for higher prices.
