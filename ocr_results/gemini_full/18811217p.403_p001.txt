[DECEMBER 17, 1881.] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 403

TYNE.
The quantity of arrivals during the past seven days has again been larger than usual, caused by change of wind allowing some overdue vessels to reach the port.
They consist mainly of pit-props; one cargo from Quebec, three cargoes of deals from the Baltic, and one of Dantzic timber make up the main features of the list.
The Rossend Castle has delivered a considerable quantity of doors and mouldings from New York for account of a local importer, and there is also the usual general assortment of goods from Gothenburg per steamer.
No change of importance is to be recorded, either as to state of trade generally or of any advance in prices.
Stocks are still small, and are being daily reduced.
At the moment stocks of deals and battens are lower in Tyne Dock than they have been at any time for several years past.
Messrs. S. Joel & Son held a sale of wood goods by auction at Tyne Dock, on Tuesday, December 13th.
A fair company assembled, and for the better class of goods a fair amount of competition took place.
The floorings sold were mainly damaged by sea-water and sand; prices realized were as follow:—
5/8d. cleading, dressed, tongued, grooved, and beaded, 5d. per square yard
1 1/4d. red tongued and grooved flooring, 10d. sq. yd.
2 1/2 x 6 1/2 3rd Norway white, per std. ... £7 2 6
2 1/2 x 7 unsorted white Hallsta £7 10s. to 7 11 0

2 x 6 ,, ,, ,, 8 6 3

The suspension of Mr. Nathan Watson, builder and contractor, of this town, is announced.
The liabilities are reported at £13,000, and assets at £17,000; the latter consist mainly of property in dwelling-houses and a large hotel.
The creditors are principally for securities held as mortgages, the unsecured creditors are mostly local firms, but the losses will not be very heavy.

GLASGOW.
The imports of wood goods to Clyde during the week have been limited to one cargo of New Brunswick deals, and from States ports various parcels of walnut, poplar, oak planks, staves, &c., altogether about 700 loads, which may be considered about the wind-up of this year's imports of wood to Glasgow and Greenock.
Of American black walnut it is to be observed that the market is at present pretty well supplied with small-sized wood, several parcels having recently been yarded.
The arrivals of wood goods at Grangemouth during the past week have been to the extent of seven cargoes, representing about 1,700 loads, and comprising Baltic timber, battens, staves, and props.
Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co.'s auction sale of American timber and deals at Port Glasgow on the 8th inst. was fairly attended, and a considerable quantity of wood of various sorts disposed of at prices noted below.
The bulk of the timber sold consisted of Quebec red pine, of which over 700 logs were disposed of.
With regard to useful dimensions full maintained their price, the stock on hand being comparatively light.
The loss of the Princess Royal some weeks ago, while on her way from Quebec to this port with a large cargo of deals, has left this market with a smaller stock than was looked forward to.
The stock of lower port spruce deals in first hands at present is light.

LEITH.
The list of arrivals at this port is again light; it embraces, however, two cargoes of deals and battens and a cargo of Riga timber for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co., besides a few parcels staves, wood pulp, &c.
No public sales have been held here since my last, but Messrs. Jas. Duncan & Co. have one advertised for the 20th inst.
The market remains unchanged both as regards demand and prices, and little change may be expected for some time.

ABERDEEN.
Since our last several sales have taken place in Aberdeen, and elsewhere in the north, at about our last month's quotations; if any difference, prices seem firmer.
This may be accounted for by the unusually fine weather at this season; for while the weather continues fresh building is carried on to some extent.
Several sales of home timber have been held recently in the north; this class of goods seems rather to decline in price: indeed, we are aware that on some large and extensively wooded estates the standard prices of larch and fir timber of 1s. per cubic feet for larch and 6d. for fir have been reduced to 10d. and 4d. respectively, and smaller sizes in proportion, and since this reduction has taken place some have resolved to substitute home for foreign timber for estate purposes.

THE WOODS OF COLUMBIA.
We learn, says the North-western Lumberman, from consular reports forwarded from Carthagena, United States of Colombia, the following information relating to the timber of that republic:—
Besides cedar, mahogany, lignum-vitæ, nispero, limoncillo, and colorado timber, there exists an abundance of other valuable woods, such as viva-seca, lancewood, rosewood, guayba uraba, dividivi and santa-cruz.
There are also a number of wood of the first quality for naval construction, such as corazon verde (greenheart), &c.
There is a wood called olleto, out of which piles can be made, that cannot be destroyed by the teredo.
Of the woods mentioned, the supply of cedar and mahogany is inexhaustible; of ebony, rosewood, colorado, and lignum-vitæ, nearly so.
A cargo of timber can be procured that will average nearly 800 ft. per stick.
The writer has a hewed stick of cedar which measures 42 x 48 in., 19 ft. long, and a hewed stick of

mahogany which measures 24 x 34 in., 32 ft. long.
He has seen a canoe 63 ft. in length by 4 ft. 4 in. in width, that had been hollowed out of the heart of a cedar tree, and one of 70 ft. in length by 10 ft. in width that was hollowed out of the heart of a campana tree.
There are several trees standing in the forests near Monteria that have a circumference of 30 ft.
