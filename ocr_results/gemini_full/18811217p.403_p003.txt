MONTREAL.—The export of deals from Montreal to the United Kingdom during the season of 1881 just closed stood at 38 cargoes, containing 21,838,287 ft., against 19,781,885 ft. in 1880, showing an increase of 2,056,402 ft. when the one year is compared with the other.
STORMS IN THE ATLANTIC.—The *Celtic* arrived at New York recently, three days late. She reported heavy storms; the wind blew a hurricane for nine days. The *Italy*, eight days late, makes a similar report. The *Gallia*, of the Cunard line, which arrived at New York on the 25th ult., encountered fearful weather. The waves rose to a great height, and broke over the vessel. The steamer *Suevia*, from Hamburg to New York, and the steamer *Somerset*, from Bristol to New York, have both put into St. John's short of coal.
EPPS'S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.—"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately-flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame."—*Civil Service Gazette*. Made simply with boiling water or milk. Sold only in Packets labelled—"JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London."—Also makers of Epps's Chocolate Essence for afternoon use.—*Advt*.
