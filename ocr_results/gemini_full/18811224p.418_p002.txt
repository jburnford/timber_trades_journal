A PERFECT PASSENGER SHIP.
The constantly increasing magnitude of our iron steamships is one of the wonders of the age we live in, and nobody knows where it is to stop. The newest instance, though not the largest, is the steamship India, built for the British India Steam Navigation Company, whose extensive range covers the entire East, having its trunk services all round the coast of India, the Persian Gulf, the east coast of Africa, besides the Red Sea, and from London to India, Java, and Queensland, numbering a fleet of 82 steamers afloat or in course of construction.
The India was constructed by the well-known builders, Messrs. William Denny & Sons, of Dumbarton. The registered tonnage of this ship is 4,085 tons, and the dimensions are-length 390ft., breadth 42 ft., and depth 31 ft. She is propelled by engines of 3,000 indicated horse-power, and maintained on trial a mean speed of 14 1/2 knots. She is classed 100 A 1 at Lloyd's, and has the Admiralty certificate, which guarantees the thorough subdivision of the steamer by water-tight bulkheads and the assurance that the piercing of no single compartment can sink the vessel. The India is a flush-decked steamer, but with the greater number of her citadel house, extending and enclosing all the machinery spaces. The peculiarity of carrying the first-class passengers in a citadel house, which will be appreciated for about 140 ft. amidships, is one of the late mishaps at vital openings of the main importance of this feature by the public when some sea are thought of. The cabins are lighted with Swann's electric lights, three. The advantage of will be evident to travel who have suffered from oil lamps, which create and are frequently extinguished by punkahs or draughts. In addition to the ordinary saloon there is a music-room for ladies, a smoking and reading-room for gentlemen, a messroom for children and nurses. The saloon is most elaborately and has, in lieu of panels, a series of fine oil paintings by Mr. Adams, a rising Scotch artist. The ventilation for the tropics has been carefully provided; for the saloon has windows on three sides, those in the fore end giving a good current of fresh air. We may remark, besides, that the steamer is fitted with all modern appliances for navigation and the rapid discharge of cargo, including Sir Wm. Thomson's compass and sounding machine and steam steering gear. She has also eight powerful steam winches, working two at each of the four large hatches, for the speedy discharge of cargo, and is provided with Gilford's refrigerating gear for the preservation of fresh meat. Another feature in this steamer is that the crew and firemen are placed in the after-part of the vessel, with their cooking ranges and latrines. The passengers' galley being also placed abaft the saloon and cabin, travellers will breathe only the fresh sea air, uncontaminated by the smell of cooking and the engines, so trying to many. The India sailed yesterday from Gravesend for Colombo, Madras, and Calcutta, after embarking eighty-two cabin passengers; and she possesses advantages which no other steamer can claim. We may safely predict that if handled with the same ability as has gained for the British India Steam Navigation Company such high credit, she will become one of the most popular ships in the Indian trade.

TALL HOUSES.
-The building that is being erected on Monroe Street, west of the new First National Bank, says a Chicago paper, will be the highest business block in that city. It will be about 139 ft. above the pavement, and will consist of nine stories and a basement. There is a growing tendency to build higher than formerly, and very rightly too. Lots are rapidly increasing in value, and with the present system of elevators the tenth story can be reached about as easily as the second. Many of the lawyers, money brokers, &c., who occupy the offices of the upper floors of these high buildings will "probably never get any higher, but for a few brief years they can revel in the thought that they are considerably above most of their fellows."

TUESDAY INFLUENZA, SORE THROAT IRRITATION.-Soreness and dryness, tickling and irritation, inducing cough and affecting the voice. For these symptoms use Epps's Glycerine Jujubes. Glycerine, in these agreeable confections, being in proximity to the glands at the moment they are excited by the act of sucking becomes actively healing. Sold only in boxes, 7 1/2d and 1s.1 1/2d., labelled "JAMES EPPS & Co., Homoeopathic Chemists, London." A letter received: "Gentlemen,-It may, perhaps, interest you to know that, after an extended trial, I have found your Glycerine Jujubes of considerable benefit (with or without medical treatment) in almost all forms of throat disease. They soften and clear the voice. -Yours faithfully, GORDON HOLMES, L.R.C.P.E., Senior Physician to the Municipal Throat and Ear Infirmary."--Adv.
