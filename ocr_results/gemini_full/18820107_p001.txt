GLASGOW.
There has been little business done during the past week, being the New Year holiday season.
Imports of wood to Glasgow and Greenock amount to 500 loads, consisting of sundry parcels wainscot oak, &c., and a small cargo of Riga redwood at Greenock.
In view of prospective requirements for shipbuilding and other purposes, the aggregate stock (all descriptions of wood) now in Clyde ports appears moderate, rate, being decidedly under the average of the three preceding years, though equal on the whole to the quantity held a year ago.
The stock of pitch pine, it may be noted, as compared with that of several years back, is in excess; but the great activity in shipbuilding gives promise of a large consumption.
The shipbuilding trade on Clyde has now assumed gigantic proportions.
From the undernoted statement of the launches at five districts on the river—say from Glasgow to Greenock, or within a distance of 22 miles—it is shown that there have been built during 1881 217 steamers and 52 sailing vessels, representing a total of 331,868 tons, and an estimated value of about £7,000,000.
The largest steamer launched was 7,392 tons register.
Hitherto the year 1874 had been looked upon as an exceptional one in the annals of shipbuilding, and it certainly had many circumstances favourable for a large turn-out of work.
As contributing to the high total of last year's work, it is to be noted that there has been little interruption in business during the whole course of the year through disputes between employer and employed, and it is satisfactory to find that nearly every yard is now full of work, and some of the larger builders have lately taken contracts not to be delivered before the spring of 1883.
There are a number of vessels on the stocks in the various yards, and the estimate of the number of men employed is about 45,000.

LEITH.
The arrival of wood goods at this port during the past week is exceedingly small, only three cargoes battens having been reported and two parcels of staves.
No public sales have been held during the past week, the closing months of 1881 certainly proving a great contrast to the preceding year, when sales were so frequent that they cannot but have had a damaging effect upon the market.
At present there seems little prospect of merchants in the district forcing stocks upon the market, the inclination being rather to hold for higher prices.
The fine open season which we have had up till now has allowed building operations to go on unchecked, but the trade is still quiet.
Prices, if anything, are rather firmer, although an advance is difficult to obtain.

PEAR WOOD.—The timber of the pear-tree is of a yellow colour.
Gerard says the timber of the wild pear is very firm and solid, and good to be cut into moulds.
The plates for his “Herbal” were cut out of this wood, as were the present plates for English gentlewomen.
In the present day it is much used by turners and pattern-makers; the blocks with which the designs for floorcloths are painted are made from pearwood.
When dyed black it can scarcely be distinguished from ebony.
Handles for carpenters’ tools, measuring rules, &c., are made from this wood.
The wood of the pear makes excellent fuel, giving out an intense heat with a bright flame.—*Science Gossip*.
