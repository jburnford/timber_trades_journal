It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.\"—Civil Service Gazette.—Made simply with boiling water or milk. Sold only in Packets, labelled—\" JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London.\" —Also makers of Epps's Chocolate Essence.\n\nMAHOGANY AND HARDWOODS.\nMessrs. CHALONER & Co.'s last circular says:—There have not been any auction sales in the past fortnight, and there is not any alteration to report in the condition of this market. St. Domingo.—There is not any stock of logs on hand, and early imports from the City or Porto Plata will meet with ready sale on arrival, as there was a good demand at the late auction sales. Well-grown curls, 3 ft. long and up, are in request, but those of short lengths and inferior qualities are slow of sale. Cuba.—There have not been any imports for some time past, and there is now a good opening for a cargo of suitable dimensions. Honduras was in good request at the sale of the 15th ult., and full prices were obtained, which should be maintained at the next auction, as the stock on hand is only moderate. Mexican.—Tabasco: The demand continues active, and full prices have ruled. The stock in first hands is only 532 logs. Minatitlan: As yet only one cargo has arrived this season; it will be offered by auction on the 5th January, and will no doubt realize a satisfactory result, notwithstanding that the logs are chiefly of small to medium sizes. Cedar is in strong demand, and imports from Honduras, Mexico, and Cuba will meet with quick sale at high figures. There is not any stock on hand. Pencil cedar is slow of sale. Walnut: Italian is only in limited request. Circassian: The demand is very slow, and only low prices will tempt buyers. Burrs: Some parcels of old imports have been sold in the past few days at very low prices compared with the original limits. American black walnut is in good demand at high prices. Lignum-vitæ: There is not any stock on hand of prime quality from City St. Domingo, but there is an active demand, and fresh, round, sound, thin sapwood, 7 in. dia. and upwards, will obtain extremely good figures.\nA statement of the Landings and Deliveries of Furniture Woods at the Port of London.\nLanded week ending Dec. 30.

The first cut was 24 ft. long, and the next log 32 ft. long, and an average diameter of over 5 ft.\nGERMAN OPINION ON SAWS.—The German industrial papers have been discussing the question of the disadvantages of circular saws as compared with band saws: 1, circular saws are very dangerous to the workmen; 2, they require much greater power to drive them than any other kind; 3, they make a much wider cut, producing more waste, and thus fewer products from a given amount of material. The only advantage is that the cost of procuring a circular saw is less than that of a band saw, but, notwithstanding this, the Mechanics' Association of Muehlhausen have already published in their yearly report the advice to abolish their use wherever it is practically possible to do so, and this is, of course, the case in the great majority of circumstances.\n\nJANUARY 6, 1883.\nSHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\nFREIGHTS.\nWe make the following extracts from Messrs.
