CASUALTIES.
The Ann, of Halifax, N.S., with wood, arrived at Bristol this week with wood cargo, and reports that on the 3rd inst., in the Atlantic Ocean, she was struck by a heavy sea, carrying away bulwarks, light screens, and other gear, and compelling jettison of cargo.

The Norwegian brig Alpha, for Sunderland, with pit-props, put into Mandal this week, having been in collision, and received damages.

The Eliza O'Keefe on entering Bute Dock, Cardiff, last Saturday evening, with pitwood, collided with pierhead, and had bowsprit and bulwarks carried away.

The Dominion Line steamer Quebec, which left Portland, Maine, for Liverpool, on New Year's Day, was eleven days overdue on Wednesday last, and caused a little anxiety.

During the week ending January 17th there were 52 casualties entered at Lloyd's, in four of which the whole crew was lost, and in three others, one, three, and one life respectively. Two vessels only were with timber cargoes, one condemned, the other abandoned, but no loss of life in either.

NAVIGATION AND THE WEATHER.
Lloyd's agent at Reval, telegraphing under date January 22nd, states:—Baltic port navigation closed. A telegram from Odessa of same harbour is nearly full of ice, Navarino is now open for steamers, but sailers will have to wait a few days.

REVAL (Jan. 22nd).—Baltic port navigation closed.

EMDEN (Jan. 20th).—The port and river here are nearly free of ice.

BREMEN (Jan. 20th).—Navigation between Bremen and Bremerhaven reopened again.

HAMBURG (Jan. 18th).—The Elbe is still full of drift-ice, which, however, does not much obstruct the navigation for sea-going steamers.

BREMERHAVEN (Jan. 17th).—So far as can be seen there is much drift-ice in the Weser.

SWINEMUNDE, (Jan. 16).—There was a heavy ice-drift here to-day, and much ice is in sight at sea in the offing, especially to eastward.

LAST YEAR'S REVENUE.—The Treasury has issued an abstract of the gross produce of the United Kingdom for the third quarter of the financial year. The total receipts for the quarter just ended are £20,998,148, being £78,588 in excess of the revenue for the corresponding quarter of last year, which was £20,919,560.
