THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular while its cost being about half. The results of tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made any length up to 300 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, as it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension, hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially woven for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process to prove them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belting is only a question of time.
