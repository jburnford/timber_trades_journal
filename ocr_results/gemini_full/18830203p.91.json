The boat Wolverhampton, from Waterford for Swansea, with pitwood, was wrecked on the Welsh coast. The barque Admiral Prins Adalbert, laden with pitwood and bound for Swansea, was being towed past the Mumbles, when she broke loose from the tug-boat, and was driven ashore, where she became a total wreck. The gale, at the time, was so terrific that in their endeavour to save the crew of the barque a heavy sea dashed four of the lifeboat men against the rocks, causing fatal injuries, and others were only saved from drowning by great exertions. The crew of the Prins Adalbert were eventually able to wrlk ashore over the rocks.\nThe schooner Portland, from Waterford for Cardiff, with a cargo of pitwood, was wrecked this week, off the Welsh coast. The crew were saved, but the vessel became a total weck.\nCALIFORNIAN AND OREGON FREIGHTS.—San Francisco freights have somewhat improved, and the rate for iron ships is now quoted at 42s. 6d. There is also a slight inquiry for next season at 45s. wood, 50s. iron. Portland rates are inactive, 47s. 6d. being about current rate for iron ships, but it is rumoured that very little produce is left for export. Next season, 50s. wood, 55s. iron is quoted.\nNAVIGATION AND THE WEATHER.\nEMDEN (Jan. 26th).—Wind S.E. The Ems and fairway are full of drift ice, and the navigation is closed again.\nPALERMO (Jan. 25th).—A heavy gale has blown on this coast for the last two days; some casualties have occurred, but not of great importance.\nNEW ORLEANS (Jan. 17th).—The steamer Rochester, for Havre, went to sea this evening without detention, drawing 25 ft. 11 in. of water.\nCHRISTIANIA (Jan. 23rd).—It is freezing hard, but the fairway to all the quays is still passable. The ice-breakers are at work in the eastern and western entrances.\nSULINA (Jan. 22nd).—The river finally closed January 20th, but the harbour is quite free up to the one-mile post. There is a considerable quantity of loose ice in the North Bay and at sea, coming and going with a change of wind, but nothing to stop navigation.",
