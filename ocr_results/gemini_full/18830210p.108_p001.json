Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather. Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, clings well to the pulleys, runs true, and can be made any length without joints.\nThis Series of Belts (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley & Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.\nOver 500,000 Feet SOLD DURING 1882,\nincluding 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, in widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. and working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Great Britain and America.\nFirst Prize, Berlin, 1879.\nPRIZES.—HAMBURG, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1882; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.\nThe following Tests (by Thomas Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.\nBest Double Leather 6in. Belting ... Breaking Strain per Square In. of Section. 3,572 lbs. ... Price per foot. 5s. 7d.\nGandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton ... Breaking Strain per Square In. of Section. 6,811 lbs. ... Price per foot. 2s. 6d.\nTHE “GANDY” BELT.\nGANDY’S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests given above, to which special attention is directed. These “Gandy” Belts are made of a width without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. Gandy’s Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American “Cotton Duck,” specially made for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy’s patented special Machinery and process, which render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy’s Belts can only be a question of time.\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nMAURICE GANDY, PATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER, 130 QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON, E.C.
