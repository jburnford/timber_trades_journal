J. LAUGHTON.—The debtor, Edward Josiah Laughton, of 51, Bread Street, Cheapside, builder, has filed a liquidation petition; and Mr. A. R. Chamberlayne applied to the court on Tuesday for the appointment of a receiver in the case, and for an injunction restraining several actions.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nFIELDUS & Co.—A petition for liquidation was filed last week in the Brighton Bankruptcy Court, by Messrs. Fieldus, Son, & Co., of Queen's Road, Brighton, furniture dealers and builders, by creditors representing £24,000. A receiver and estate manager has been appointed. The firm has stopped payment.\nWALKER, CROUCH & LINDWALE.—The debtors, who have filed a petition for liquidation, are shipbuilders and engineers, carrying on business in Railway Place, Fenchurch Street. Their debts are estimated at £60,000, the greater portion of the amount being secured; assets not yet ascertained. Upon the application of Mr. T. L. Wilkinson, supported by creditors, the Registrar appointed Mr. Dever, accountant, to be receiver and manager under the proceedings.\nSPENCER GREEN.—A first meeting was held before Mr. Registrar Brougham, on Tuesday, in the bankruptcy of Spencer Green, of West Hampstead, Parliament Street, and St. John's Wood, builder and contractor. A petition for liquidation had been filed by the bankrupt in December last, but the proceedings became abortive, and an adjudication was made on January 24th, upon the petition of Mr. A. J. Tatham, of South Wharf, Paddington Basin. No accounts were filed, and in the absence of a quorum of creditors a trustee could not be appointed, the proceedings being adjourned to Tuesday next.\nD. SHAW.—A petition has been filed by David Shaw, builder, 40, Lincoln Street, Gateshead, liabilities £2,329 17s. 9d. The first meeting is to take place on Monday, February 9th, at Newcastle. The names of the creditors are as follow:—Messrs. Bainbridge & Crimson, Gateshead, £68; J. T. Corking, do., £21; Hall, South Shields, £21; J. W. Robinson & Co., Gateshead, £550; Shipcote Quarry Co., do., £21; B. Slater, do., £28; J. Scott, Newcastle, £113; and J. W. Winter, do., £1,500.\nT. WILLSHER.—A petition has been filed by Thomas Willsher, builder, &c., St. John Street, and Newtown, Chichester, with liabilities £1,635 2s. 10d. The creditors are Messrs.—Canner, Chichester, £50; J. Clements, do., £25; Cover, Brothers do., £89; Evershed & Co., Littlehampton, £128; E. T. Habin, Chichester, £95; Henry Halteads, do., £1,200; J. Sayers, do., £27.\nJ. A. WILKS.—A petition has been filed by James Ashenden Wilks, builder, &c., Cowper Street, Hove; liabilities £2,304 18s. 8d. The following are among the creditors:—Messrs. Beves & Co., Brighton, £120; Botting, do., £21; Butt & Sons, do., £44; B. Farringdon, do., £220; G. Freeman, do., £53; J. H. Gardner, do., £57; Holloway & Fielders, do., £93; D. Hunter, do., £240; G.

RANGELEY.—A meeting of the creditors of Edward Rangeley, of Ducie Street, Stockport Road, Longsight, and also of Tyldesley Road, Blackpool, builder and contractor, was held last Saturday at the offices of Mr. James Gardner, Cooper Street. The debtor was granted his immediate order of discharge. The principal creditors were represented by Mr. Thomas Sutton, chartered accountant, and by Mr. Gardner, solicitor.\nHENRY BROOKS.—Mr. Winslow, Q.C., applied on Wednesday for confirmation of a scheme of arrangement which has been agreed to in this case at a meeting of creditors held under the 28th section. The debtor, who filed his petition in September last, was described as a manufacturer of pianoforte keys and actions, and other goods, carrying on business in Lyme Street, Camden Road, also at Regent's Park, Hampstead Road, and Kentish Town, under the style of Henry Brooks & Co. His liabilities amounted to £50,416, and the accounts disclosed a surplus, subject to realization of assets. In the first instance it was resolved that the estate should be liquidated by arrangement, with Mr. C. F. Kemp, accountant, as trustee; but the creditors had since decided to accept the debtor's offer of a composition of 12s. 6d. in the pound, with interest, payable in five equal instalments at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 calendar months from the date of the order of confirmation. The discharge of the debtor and the closing of the liquidation were also provided for, and two deeds had been executed with the view of carrying the arrangement into effect. The Registrar said his attention had been called to certain features in the arrangement. There was a question whether the resolutions were strictly within the 28th section, but, upon consideration, he had come to the conclusion that the objection was more technical than substantial. He presumed that the two deeds which formed part of the arrangement had been submitted to the meeting of creditors. Mr. Winslow replied in the affirmative. Mr. Registrar Murray: The\n\n109\narrangement seem to have been thoroughly considered, and I see no reason why the resolution should not be confirmed. Application granted.\nTHERE were 30 failures in the building trades during last week, against 17 in corresponding week of last year, or 13 more. The total number of failures registered this and last year, during the same periods, was 248 against 209, or an increase of 39.\nBILLS OF SALE.\n£ s. d.\nGummow Geo.
