  "text": "FEBRUARY 17, 1883.] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\n\nof the Albion Mills, have been working\novertime for some weeks past, and this, we\nhear, has also been the case at some\nneighbouring mills, whilst all appear to\nhave a fair amount of work in hand.\nThe importation of wood goods during\nlast month was as follows:—\nTim. dls. props. slps.\nJanuary 1883 396 1,158 1,259 661\n” 1882 2,569 5,992 1,387 149\n\nSUNDERLAND.\nThe arrivals of wood goods at this port\nduring the month have been good for this\ntime of year, and include three steamers\nfrom Gothenburg with about 1,600 loads pit-\nprops and a small quantity of crowntrees,\none from Halmstadt with 800 loads pit-\nprops, two sailers from Norway, and several\nsmall Scotch vessels with about 800 loads\nmining timber of various kinds, principally\nfrom Bordeaux.\n\nGRIMSBY.\nThe wood importations have now for a\nseason ceased, and a portion of the quay\nfrontage at the Royal Dock, usually occu-\npied by timber-laden ships, is filled with\nfishing smacks and other small craft.\nThe Alexandra Dock presents an empty\nand desolate appearance. A considerable\nportion of the shipping now docked at\nGrimsby appears to consist of vessels which\nare “laid up” for the winter. Trade\nduring the past fortnight has here been\nrather quiet.\nPrices for most classes of goods are not\nvery firm. We have not heard of anything\nhaving been as yet bought to arrive, and,\nno doubt, importers will decide to hold off\nfrom buying as long as possible.\n\nGLASGOW.\nImports continue very light; the tem-\npestuous weather experienced in all quarters\nfor some time past may have something to\ndo with this, vessels being kept back: it\ncertainly has interfered with general out-\ndoor work all over the country.\nResults of public sales held on 8th and\n14th inst. are noted below. At the sale at\nPort Glasgow on the 8th inst., a moderate\nquantity of timber changed hands. Weather\nproved very inclement, as it also was at the\nsale here on the 14th inst. The birch tim-\nber (which was of small square) realized\nvery high rates. The walnut was chiefly\nsmall and of rather plain quality.\nAs the Clyde shipbuilding yards are fully\ntaken up with ships in progress and laying\ndown keels, it is certain much timber will\nbe required, such as superior boardwood\nand hardwoods, and also Mexican and Hon-\nduras mahogany.\n\nAUCTION SALES.\nOn 8th inst., at Port Glasgow, Messrs.\nWright & Breakenridge, brokers:—\nQuebec waney boardwood—\n50 c. ft. av. per log 1s. 9½d. per c. ft.\nDo. joisting yellow pine (superior)—\n40 c. ft. av. per log 1s. 10½d. & 1s. 10d. „\nDo. red pine—\n35 c. ft. av. per log 1s. 3d. „\n29 „ „ 1s. 2½d. „\nDo. elm—\n22 „ „ 1s. 5½d. „\nPensacola hewn pitch pine—\n75 & 80 c. ft. av. per log 1s. 4d. & 1s. 3d. „\nDo. sawn pitch pine—\n80 c. ft. av. per log 1s. 2½d. „\nNova Scotia spruce deals—\n19 to 26ft. 8x3 10d. „\n9 „ 11 „ 8x3 9½d. „\n9ft. 7x3 9½d. „\nDo. spruce palings—\n4ft. x 3in. x ¾in. per 1,000 50s.\nPitch pine planks—\n12 to 31ft. 11/15½, 2½/3½ 1s. „\nOn 14th inst., at Glasgow, Messrs.\nMcDowall & Neilson exposed by auction a\ncargo from Weymouth, N.S., viz.:—\nSpruce deals— cub. ft.\n10 to 22 ft. 14/18x3 12d. „\n10 „ 23 „ 13x3 13d. „\n10 „ 23 „ 12x3 12½d. „\n10 „ 16 „ 11x3 13d. „\n20 „ 25 „ 11x3 12½d. & 12¾d. „\n12 „ 14 „ 11x3 12½d. „\n10 & 11 „ 11x3 12d. „\n13 „ 10x3 11¾d. „\n10 & 11 „ 9x3 11½d. „\n12 „ 8x3 11¾d. „\n13/15 & 17 „ 8x3 10¾d. „\n10 & 11 „ 8x3 11d. „\n21 to 27 „ 7x3 11½d. „\n10 „ 15 „ 7x3 10¾d. „\n\nThere are one or two inquiries in the\nmarket for tonnage home from Archangel\nand Quebec, but we have not heard of any-\nthing having been chartered yet. A good\ntrade is being done in French pitwood.\nArrivals are regular, and the collieries in\nthe district are working full time, so that a\nbrisk demand is being kept up, and prices\nare well sustained at 19s. 6d. to 20s.\nTonnage home from Bordeaux is moderately\nplentiful. Operations in Norway timber are\nalso pretty numerous, and for good wood\n34s. 6d. to 35s. f.o.r. is being realized.\nThe arrivals during the week have com-\nprised 450 tons of wood pulp from Chris-\ntiania, 92 standards of mining timber from\nArendal, and of pit-props 2,880 loads from\nBordeaux, 104 from Auray, and 65 from\nPenzance.\nfor Messrs. Rayner & Moller, Pyman\n& Co., J. C. W. Meier & Co. About a\nsailing vessels are daily expected with\nwood for local merchants.\nTrade all round is steady, but rather\nmerchants holding larger stocks than\nusually find at this season of the year.\nstocks, however, are rapidly diminishing,\nthe large deliveries that are being made\nevery week. The late severe gales have\nprevented outdoor work of any kind being\ncarried on; consequently the demand\namongst builders and shipbuilders has been\nsmall.\nSeveral c.i.f. contracts have been closed\nthis week from Stettin, Dantzic, and Memel\nfor f.o.w. shipment at a shade less than last\nyear’s prices; shippers at these ports are\ntherefore busy securing vessels.\nAlthough nearly all the merchants have\nconcluded their purchases from Sweden for\nspring shipment, few are inclined either to\nquote rates of freight or state their require-\nments. From that we conclude differences\nof opinion exists as to what Baltic freights\nwill open at. The only actual f.o.w. business\nwe know of is 25s. Memel to this port for\ndeals. Being a large vessel, and one not\nusually engaged in the timber trade, it would\nperhaps be hardly fair to take that rate as a\nbasis for freight from that neighbourhood.\n\nTYNE.\nOne cargo of pit-props and the usual\nassortment in one of the Gothenburg\nsteamers complete the list of imports\nduring the last seven days, and, small as\nit is, it seems ample for the very moderate\nrequirements of the trade at the moment.\nSince January 1st business has been ex-\ntremely quiet, more so than for at least a\nyear or two back. This appears to apply\nmore particularly the building and contract-\ning trades, for all of which there appears\nno great prospect for this year, at any rate.\nIn shipbuilding and kindred trades there is\na better demand, and prices of all goods\nused by them are firmer than they were. A\nlarge business for the year is reported with\nLondon agents as having been done on the\nTyne, and many inquiries for ships have\nbeen made. Contracts generally are re-\nported to be closed at a reduction of about\n10s. on redwood, and more on whitewood\nbelow last year’s rates.\nFreights rule much about the same as\nlast season; 27s. from Stockholm, 28s.\nfrom Gefle, 30s. to 31s. from Sundswall, are\nreported as having been closed.\nThe Tyne Commissioners have now issued\nthe official list of imports to the Tyne,\nforeign and coastwise during the last year,\nfrom which it will be seen the total import\nin loads amount to 273,007; it is a little\ncurious it exceeds the imports of 1881 by\nprecisely 1,000 loads, and makes the highest\nfigures of any time during the last eight\nyears, the figures being as follows:—\n1876, 253,134; 1877, 205,757; 1878,\n183,997; 1879, 167,964; 1880, 230,121;\n1881, 272,007; 1882, 273,007.\nAs Hartlepool is generally considered\nthe emporium of the east coast trade and its\nfuture home imported only by Board of\nTrade returns 329,336 loads, it bids fair to\nbe run close by the Tyne, and will need to\nlook to its laurels.\n\nCARDIFF.\nThere is no great change in our market,\nand for the heavier classes of wood things\nhave not altered since the last time we wrote.\n\n123\nbirch timber (small squares), 60 logs, at 1s. 9½d.\nper cubic foot; 36 logs, 1s. 7½d. do.\nMessrs. Edmiston & Mitchells thereafter\nsold a small parcel of American black\nwalnut, viz., 21 logs, 15½ in. square, at an\naverage of 4s. 7½d. per cubic foot.\n\nLEITH.\nTrade here remains quiet; in several of\nthe outlying districts there is, however,\nprospect of improvement, and the open\nseason (with the exception of one severe\nstorm) will doubtless improve matters for the\nspring. The import list, with the exception\nof a lot of staves, is blank.\nOn Tuesday, Messrs. James Duncan & Co.\noffered a varied selection of timber for\npublic competition. Only about 4,000 ft. of\nyellow pine was advertised, and even this\nquantity was not all sold. The low\nprice obtained for the few parcels sold need\nnot be taken as any criterion, as the timber\nappeared simply to be the leavings of their\nlast ship.\nGood waney yellow pine will\neasily fetch 1s. per cubic foot more than was\nrealized; the fault, however, lay in the\ntimber. On starting the sale the company\nwas very thin, and buyers could not be\nfound for some time, and the auctioneer did\nnot seem at all inclined to hang on, and\nrapidly passed from lot to lot; as the\ncompany gradually increased a bid was\nthrown in here and there, and, once started,\na good number of the lots found buyers.\nStill, the sale was not by any means up to\nMessrs. Duncan & Co.’s average, either as\nregards turn-over or prices obtained.\nYellow pine deals did not sell nearly so well as\nmight have been expected from their scarcity,\n11 in. and 12 in. bringing, after a struggle,\n3s. A few lots of damaged white 9x3\nRiga deals sold well at 2½d. per lin. foot.\nThe following is a note of prices obtained:—\nHewn pitch pine 17½d. to 18d. per cub. ft.\nSawn „ 16d. to 16½d. „\nDanzig redwood 14d. to 15d. „\nAmerican whitewood, 11s. to 15s. „\nRiga wainscot, 2s. 3d. „\nWaney yellow pine, 2s. 1d. and 2s. 2d. „\nYellow pine deals (11in. & 12in.) 8s. „\nWhite Petersburg deals 8d. per lin. ft.\n9x3 white Sundswall deals 2½d. „\n9x3 Riga deals 1¾d. „\n9x3 Wyburg deals 1¾d. „\n7x2½ Riga battens 1d. „\n7x2½ Archangel and red battens ¾d. per sup. yd.\n4x1½ red flooring 8½d. „\n6x1¼ white flooring 1s. „\n\nIMPORTS.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbre-\nviate the names of importers when by so doing a\nline can be saved.—ED.]\n\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nBARNSTAPLE.\nFeb. 9 Ogir—Sundswall—9,410 deals and boards,\n218 pes. fir, and 8 lds. firewood—Shapland &\nPetter\nBRISTOL.\nFeb. 13 Jersey City (s)—New York—108 oak and\n4 square walnut logs—Wards\nCARDIFF.\nFeb. 6 Isabella—Villagarcia—135 lds. pit-\nwood—Manzanos & Co.\n7 Delphine Elizabeth—Bordeaux—106 lds. pit-\nwood—Order\n7 Renfrew (s)—Bordeaux—583 lds. pitwood—\nHeard, & Ingram\n7 Rosenius—Bordeaux—550 lds. pitwood—Jones\n8 Zeus—Bordeaux—550 lds. pitwood—Jesson\n8 Galathea—Bordeaux—650 lds. pitwood—\nThompson\n9 Syphon—Arendal—2,117 pcs. mining timber—\nR.
