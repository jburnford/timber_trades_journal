FEBRUARY 17, 1883.] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.

of the Albion Mills, have been working
overtime for some weeks past, and this, we
hear, has also been the case at some
neighbouring mills, whilst all appear to
have a fair amount of work in hand.
The importation of wood goods during
last month was as follows:—
Tim. dls. props. slps.
January 1883 396 1,158 1,259 661
” 1882 2,569 5,992 1,387 149

SUNDERLAND.
The arrivals of wood goods at this port
during the month have been good for this
time of year, and include three steamers
from Gothenburg with about 1,600 loads pit-
props and a small quantity of crowntrees,
one from Halmstadt with 800 loads pit-
props, two sailers from Norway, and several
small Scotch vessels with about 800 loads
mining timber of various kinds, principally
from Bordeaux.

GRIMSBY.
The wood importations have now for a
season ceased, and a portion of the quay
frontage at the Royal Dock, usually occu-
pied by timber-laden ships, is filled with
fishing smacks and other small craft.
The Alexandra Dock presents an empty
and desolate appearance. A considerable
portion of the shipping now docked at
Grimsby appears to consist of vessels which
are “laid up” for the winter. Trade
during the past fortnight has here been
rather quiet.
Prices for most classes of goods are not
very firm. We have not heard of anything
having been as yet bought to arrive, and,
no doubt, importers will decide to hold off
from buying as long as possible.

GLASGOW.
Imports continue very light; the tem-
pestuous weather experienced in all quarters
for some time past may have something to
do with this, vessels being kept back: it
certainly has interfered with general out-
door work all over the country.
Results of public sales held on 8th and
14th inst. are noted below. At the sale at
Port Glasgow on the 8th inst., a moderate
quantity of timber changed hands. Weather
proved very inclement, as it also was at the
sale here on the 14th inst. The birch tim-
ber (which was of small square) realized
very high rates. The walnut was chiefly
small and of rather plain quality.
As the Clyde shipbuilding yards are fully
taken up with ships in progress and laying
down keels, it is certain much timber will
be required, such as superior boardwood
and hardwoods, and also Mexican and Hon-
duras mahogany.

There are one or two inquiries in the
market for tonnage home from Archangel
and Quebec, but we have not heard of any-
thing having been chartered yet. A good
trade is being done in French pitwood.
Arrivals are regular, and the collieries in
the district are working full time, so that a
brisk demand is being kept up, and prices
are well sustained at 19s. 6d. to 20s.
Tonnage home from Bordeaux is moderately
plentiful. Operations in Norway timber are
also pretty numerous, and for good wood
34s. 6d. to 35s. f.o.r. is being realized.
The arrivals during the week have com-
prised 450 tons of wood pulp from Chris-
tiania, 92 standards of mining timber from
Arendal, and of pit-props 2,880 loads from
Bordeaux, 104 from Auray, and 65 from
Penzance.
for Messrs. Rayner & Moller, Pyman
& Co., J. C. W. Meier & Co. About a
sailing vessels are daily expected with
wood for local merchants.
Trade all round is steady, but rather
merchants holding larger stocks than
usually find at this season of the year.
stocks, however, are rapidly diminishing,
the large deliveries that are being made
every week. The late severe gales have
prevented outdoor work of any kind being
carried on; consequently the demand
amongst builders and shipbuilders has been
small.
Several c.i.f. contracts have been closed
this week from Stettin, Dantzic, and Memel
for f.o.w. shipment at a shade less than last
year’s prices; shippers at these ports are
therefore busy securing vessels.
Although nearly all the merchants have
concluded their purchases from Sweden for
spring shipment, few are inclined either to
quote rates of freight or state their require-
ments. From that we conclude differences
of opinion exists as to what Baltic freights
will open at. The only actual f.o.w. business
we know of is 25s. Memel to this port for
deals. Being a large vessel, and one not
usually engaged in the timber trade, it would
perhaps be hardly fair to take that rate as a
basis for freight from that neighbourhood.

TYNE.
One cargo of pit-props and the usual
assortment in one of the Gothenburg
steamers complete the list of imports
during the last seven days, and, small as
it is, it seems ample for the very moderate
requirements of the trade at the moment.
Since January 1st business has been ex-
tremely quiet, more so than for at least a
year or two back. This appears to apply
more particularly the building and contract-
ing trades, for all of which there appears
no great prospect for this year, at any rate.
In shipbuilding and kindred trades there is
a better demand, and prices of all goods
used by them are firmer than they were. A
large business for the year is reported with
London agents as having been done on the
Tyne, and many inquiries for ships have
been made. Contracts generally are re-
ported to be closed at a reduction of about
10s. on redwood, and more on whitewood
below last year’s rates.
Freights rule much about the same as
last season; 27s. from Stockholm, 28s.
from Gefle, 30s. to 31s. from Sundswall, are
reported as having been closed.
The Tyne Commissioners have now issued
the official list of imports to the Tyne,
foreign and coastwise during the last year,
from which it will be seen the total import
in loads amount to 273,007; it is a little
curious it exceeds the imports of 1881 by
precisely 1,000 loads, and makes the highest
figures of any time during the last eight
years, the figures being as follows:—
1876, 253,134; 1877, 205,757; 1878,
183,997; 1879, 167,964; 1880, 230,121;
1881, 272,007; 1882, 273,007.
As Hartlepool is generally considered
the emporium of the east coast trade and its
future home imported only by Board of
Trade returns 329,336 loads, it bids fair to
be run close by the Tyne, and will need to
look to its laurels.

CARDIFF.
There is no great change in our market,
and for the heavier classes of wood things
have not altered since the last time we wrote.

123
birch timber (small squares), 60 logs, at 1s. 9½d.
per cubic foot; 36 logs, 1s. 7½d. do.
Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells thereafter
sold a small parcel of American black
walnut, viz., 21 logs, 15½ in. square, at an
average of 4s. 7½d. per cubic foot.

LEITH.
Trade here remains quiet; in several of
the outlying districts there is, however,
prospect of improvement, and the open
season (with the exception of one severe
storm) will doubtless improve matters for the
spring. The import list, with the exception
of a lot of staves, is blank.
On Tuesday, Messrs. James Duncan & Co.
offered a varied selection of timber for
public competition. Only about 4,000 ft. of
yellow pine was advertised, and even this
quantity was not all sold. The low
price obtained for the few parcels sold need
not be taken as any criterion, as the timber
appeared simply to be the leavings of their
last ship.
Good waney yellow pine will
easily fetch 1s. per cubic foot more than was
realized; the fault, however, lay in the
timber. On starting the sale the company
was very thin, and buyers could not be
found for some time, and the auctioneer did
not seem at all inclined to hang on, and
rapidly passed from lot to lot; as the
company gradually increased a bid was
thrown in here and there, and, once started,
a good number of the lots found buyers.
Still, the sale was not by any means up to
Messrs. Duncan & Co.’s average, either as
regards turn-over or prices obtained.
Yellow pine deals did not sell nearly so well as
might have been expected from their scarcity,
11 in. and 12 in. bringing, after a struggle,
3s. A few lots of damaged white 9x3
Riga deals sold well at 2½d. per lin. foot.
The following is a note of prices obtained:—
Hewn pitch pine 17½d. to 18d. per cub. ft.
Sawn „ 16d. to 16½d. „
Danzig redwood 14d. to 15d. „
American whitewood, 11s. to 15s. „
Riga wainscot, 2s. 3d. „
Waney yellow pine, 2s. 1d. and 2s. 2d. „
Yellow pine deals (11in. & 12in.) 8s. „

9x3 Riga deals 1¾d. „
9x3 Wyburg deals 1¾d. „
7x2½ Riga battens 1d. „
7x2½ Archangel and red battens ¾d. per sup. yd.
4x1½ red flooring 8½d. „
