THE GANDY BELT.
Any Length or Width for Main Driving.
It is the best belt ever made for all purposes. Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather. Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, clings true, and can be made any length without joints.
This Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley & Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.
OVER 500,000 Feet
SOLD DURING 1882.
including 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are now working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in England and America.
The following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.
Best Double Leather 6in. Belting ... 3,572 lbs. ... Price per foot. 5s. 7d.
Gandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton ... 6,811 lbs. ... Price per foot. 2s. 6d.
THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular: Its great strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy of London. These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made of any length up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system which it is almost impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension, hence one or the other is always causing a great deal of slippage. Gandy's Patent Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially woven for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process, which renders them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts is only a question of time.
A SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.
