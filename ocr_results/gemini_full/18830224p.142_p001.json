John O. Smith and Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.\nOVER 500,000 FEET SOLD DURING 1882,\nincluding 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, from 14 in. to 60 in. wide, and including in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Great Britain and America.\nPRIZES.—HAMBURG, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; NEW YORK, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1881; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.\nThe following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.\nBreaking Strain per Square In. of Section. | Price per foot.\nBest Double Leather Belting | 3,572 lbs. | 5s. 7d.\nGandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton | 6,811 lbs. | 2s. 6d.\nTHE \"GANDY\" BELT.\nGANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular.\nIts cost being about half, its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests, and it can be made in any length up to 350 feet without joint, to which special attention is directed.\nThese \"Gandy\" Belts are made of any width up to 60 inches.\nIt is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a slip.\nThese \"Gandy\" Patent Belts of one width do exactly the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system objectionable in many ways, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process to render them impervious to water, steam, and atmospheric influences.\nPossessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of \"Gandy's\" Belts is only a question of time.\nMAURICE GANDY.\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nPATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER,\n130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON, WORKS: LIVERPOOL AND BALTIMORE.\n\n19 Pacific (s)-Gothenburg-2,000 bdls. laths-Allen; 5,955 props, 1,000 sleepers-Smith\nElieser-Tvedestrand-2,330 pcs. mining timber-Wells, Cookson, & Co.\n20 Domino (s)-Christiania-13-0-19 battens-Heaven & Co.\nLIVERPOOL.\nFeb. 14 Gaboon (s)-W.
