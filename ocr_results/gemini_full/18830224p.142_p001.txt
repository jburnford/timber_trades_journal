GANDY'S PATENT COTTON BELTING.
Specially suited for and Patented in India and Abroad.
Hamburg, 1878.
First Prize, Berlin, 1879.
THE GANDY BELT
Any Length or Width made for all purposes.
It is the best belt ever made, being much stronger than leather, and not affected by heat or cold.
Much Cheaper and Stronger than any other Belting.
It is equal to the best leather.
Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by changes of Temperature, clings well to the pulley, runs perfectly true, and can be made for all purposes any length without joints.
This Series of Belting (from 1 to 60 inches wide) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John O. Smith and Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.
OVER 500,000 FEET SOLD DURING 1882,
including 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, from 14 in. to 60 in. wide, and including in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Great Britain and America.
PRIZES.—HAMBURG, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; NEW YORK, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1881; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.
The following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.
Breaking Strain per Square In. of Section. | Price per foot.
Best Double Leather Belting | 3,572 lbs. | 5s. 7d.
Gandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton | 6,811 lbs. | 2s. 6d.
THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular.
Its cost being about half, its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests, and it can be made in any length up to 350 feet without joint, to which special attention is directed.
These "Gandy" Belts are made of any width up to 60 inches.
It is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a slip.
These "Gandy" Patent Belts of one width do exactly the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system objectionable in many ways, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process to render them impervious to water, steam, and atmospheric influences.
Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of "Gandy's" Belts is only a question of time.

LONDON WALL.—The City Press states that at the back of the old Roman wall can be seen a portion of the Tower of London Station of the Metropolitan Railway.
It is a remarkably fine specimen, and in perfect preservation.
GERMAN CUSTOMS DUTIES.—The German Federal Council have assented to the increase of timber duties, proposed by Prussia, the new tariff being 30 pfennigs and 70 pfennigs on every 100 kilos of raw and sawn wood respectively.
