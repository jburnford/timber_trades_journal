SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
FREIGHTS.
The remarks made in our issue of the 10th ult. still hold good. The same quietude continues, and although some considerable business have been effected during the last few days, nothing like an average pass-over has taken place. Consequently there is little eagerness displayed to secure ship-room, and the want of competition has a depressing effect on the freight market. Ships are holding off from chartering, and as stocks are considerably above the average, we take it they show a wise discretion in declining anything like a fall on ruling rates. The dearth of sales for France is difficult to answer for in the lack of life in the freight market. Our neighbours across the Channel have purchased a limited supply, and we are, we understand, chary of making any proposal for chartering, their present idea of rates mostly being 49 to 50 fcs. in full. Owners have not responded to this report, and it would appear that owners have not lost hope. Most of the pitch pine ports a rise has taken place, and for sawn, 120s. for deals from Pensacola, is not forthcoming.

STETTIN (Feb. 23rd).—The ice in the Haff, Cammin Bay, and Dievenow is still strong enough to be traversed with carts and horses. In the Papenwasser, however, the ice has become much weakened. The Damm Lake is quite free of ice.
