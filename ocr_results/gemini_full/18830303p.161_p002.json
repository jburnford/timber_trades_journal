The bankrupts were merchants and shipowners, of 28, St. Mary-axe, City, and were also in partnership with several firms. They had filed a petition for liquidation, returning their liabilities at about £300,000 ; and Mr. Arthur Cooper, accountant, was appointed receiver and manager of the estate proceedings. Mr. Romer now applied for an order authorizing the receiver and manager to accept an offer of Mr. Joseph Richardson to purchase for the sum of £850 the interest of the debtor, P. G. Carvill, in the business known as the Forest Brook Linen Company, of Belfast. It was a very advantageous offer, and both the receiver and manager at once accepted it, as the money would probably be lost to the estate. His Honour said it was not the practice of the court to allow a receiver and manager to sell any portion of the property except it was of a perishable nature. This rule was founded on the notable bankruptcy case of Ex parte, and had been acted upon ever since. He therefore refused the application.\nJ. B. & J. ENTWISTLE.—The following is a list of the chief creditors in this failure:— Messrs. J. B. & J. Entwistle, timber merchants, of Kearsley, New Bolton, Lancashire, recently filed their petition in bankruptcy:— Messrs. G. L. Prichard & Co., London, £446 15s. 4d. ; Davies, Williams & Co., do., £195 12s. 9d. ; John Harrison, do., £150; H.&G. Curwen & Co., Preston, £120; J. Smith & Sons, Luton, £56 1s. 7d.; S. & E. Collier, Sons, Luton, £13 12s. 2d. ; executors of Lord, Farnworth, £26 8s. 9d.; Richard Howarth, Bolton, £1,250; Richard Walmsley, Kearsley, £503 18s.\nALBERT AUSTIN.—The debtor, carrying on business of a builder, at 14, North-street, Caledonian Road, has presented a petition for liquidation; and Mr. W. B. Glasier has been appointed court last week for the appointment of a receiver and manager of the estate. The liabilities were estimated at about £1,900, and the assets at £870. The application was made by creditors for £745. Mr. Brougham made the appointment.\nJEWELL & TAPSON.—The adjudication in this case was made upon the petition of Messrs. Duus Brown & Co., of East India Avenue, bankrupts being described as of Lower Thames Street, Pimlico, firewood merchants. The adjourned meeting for public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Brougham. The joint statement of affairs as filed by Jewell disclosed debts to the amount of £1,326 12s. 11d.\nR. & H. ROBINSON.—An adjourned meeting for public examination in this case was held before Mr. Registrar Pepys on the 19th. The adjudication was made on the bankrupts Yorkshire petition of the Huddersfield Banking Company. The bankrupts furnished a joint statement of affairs, setting forth unsecured debts, £1,225 1s. 8d.; fully secured, £1,565; partly secured, £3,128 16s. 8d. The unsecured liabilities of Robinson amounted to £1,208 14s. 4d. The following were the principal creditors:—\n\nGANDY'S PATENT COTTON BELTING.\nSpecially suited for and Patented in India and Abroad.\n\nHamburg, 1878.\nNew Zealand, 1880.\n\nTHE GANDY BELT.\nAny Length or Width for Main Driving.\n\nIt is the best belt ever made for all purposes.\nMuch Cheaper and Stronger than Leather.\nThoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, clings well to the pulleys, runs true, and can be made any length without joints.\n\nThis Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley & Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.\n\nOver 500,000 Feet\nSOLD DURING 1882,\nincluding 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, in widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are now working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in England and America.\n\nFirst Prize, Berlin, 1879.\nPRIZES.—HAMBURGH, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1881; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.\n\nThe following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.\nBest Double Leather 6in. Belting ... Breaking strain per Square in. of Section. 3,572 lbs. Price per foot. 5s. 7d.\nGandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton ... 6,811 lbs. 2s. 6d.\n\nTHE \"GANDY\" BELT.\nGANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy. These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These \"Gandy\" Belts are made of any width up to 60 in., and are avoided by using Gandy's Patent Belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always liable to have belts of unequal strength, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system of driving which always causes a stoppage. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially woven for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process to prevent stretching and render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts is only a question of time.\n\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nMAURICE GANDY. PATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER, LONDON, WORKS: LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND AND BALTIMORE, U.S.A.\n130. QUEEN VICTORIA STREET.",
