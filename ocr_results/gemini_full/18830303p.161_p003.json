G. Carvill, in the business known as the Forest Brook Linen Company, Ireland.\nThis was a very advantageous offer, and unless the receiver and manager at once accepted it the money would probably be lost to the estate.\nHis Honour said it was not the practice of the court to allow a receiver and manager to sell any portion of the property except that of a perishable nature.\nThis rule had been laid down in the notable bankruptcy of Collie, and had been acted upon ever since.\nHe, therefore, refused the application.\nB. & J. ENTWISTLE.—The following is a list of the chief creditors in the matter of Messrs. J. B. & J.
