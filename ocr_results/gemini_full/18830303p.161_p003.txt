FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
(It must not be overlooked that in many cases where names are published in these lists whose names are for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.)
CARVILL & M'KEAN.—This case came before the court last Saturday.
The debtors were merchants and shipowners, of Gresham House, and were also in partnership with various persons.
They had filed a petition for liquidation, returning their liabilities at about £100,000; and Mr. Arthur Cooper, accountant, was appointed receiver and manager under the proceedings.
Mr. Romer now applied for an order authorising the receiver and manager to accept an offer of Mr. Joseph Crawley to purchase for the sum of £850 the interest of the debtor, P. G. Carvill, in the business known as the Forest Brook Linen Company, Ireland.
This was a very advantageous offer, and unless the receiver and manager at once accepted it the money would probably be lost to the estate.
His Honour said it was not the practice of the court to allow a receiver and manager to sell any portion of the property except that of a perishable nature.
This rule had been laid down in the notable bankruptcy of Collie, and had been acted upon ever since.
He, therefore, refused the application.
B. & J. ENTWISTLE.—The following is a list of the chief creditors in the matter of Messrs. J. B. & J. Entwistle, timber merchants, of Kearsley, New Bolton, who have recently filed their petition in liquidation :—Messrs. G. L.
