countant, of Manchester, has been appointed receiver.
J. ATKINSON.—A petition for liquidation has been filed in the Burnley County Court on behalf of James Atkinson, New Road Side, Barrowford, late of the Winewall Quarries, near Colne, builder, contractor, &c. The liabilities are estimated at £6,000.
Re W. SHAW.—In our issue of February 17th, the name of Mr. J. Scott, Newcastle, was entered as a creditor. We are, however, now asked to contradict the same, that gentleman not being a creditor in the case.

There were twenty-seven failures among the building trades last week, against twenty-eight in same week of last year, or one less. The total figures during the same periods were 239, against 248, or nine less.
