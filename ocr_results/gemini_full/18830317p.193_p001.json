CHURCHILL & SIM’s auction sale of mahogany and hardwoods at the “Baltic” on Thursday last brought together an unusually large number of buyers from all parts of the country, attracted by the superior quality of the goods offered. The Honduras mahogany was a prime lot of large-sized, straight, fine wood, and the Cuba cargo contained such a large variety of choice finely figured veneer logs as has not been offered for many years.
