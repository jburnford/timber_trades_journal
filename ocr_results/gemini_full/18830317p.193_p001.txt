LEITH.
The imports at this port consist of a parcel of walnut and a consignment of staves, both from New York per R. F. Matthews.
On Tuesday Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, & Co. exposed for public competition, at the Victoria Docks, a variety of red and white-wood deals and battens. The attendance was very small, the weather being fair but bitterly cold. The sale was chiefly confined to the sample lots, the few buyers present not seeming inclined to meet the auctioneers’ views regarding prices, though several times lots were knocked down at a low rate to induce competition. A few lots of white 6½ x 2½ battens J [?] U were disposed of at 1½d. per lin. foot, 2nd red 6½ x 2½ Kotka have fetching 1 5/8d. A few lots of 4th white 6½ x 2½ battens went at 1d., 6 x 2 bringing ¾d. The sale was brought to an unusually early conclusion, owing to the competition being so light.
On Tuesday next Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. have their annual sale, when a large company of country buyers may be expected to put in an appearance.
MAHOGANY AND HARDWOODS.
MESSRS. GEO. SHADBOLT & SON held a sale at the Commercial Salerooms, on Tuesday last, with the following result:—1,277 logs Honduras mahogany, ex Morven and New York City, were chiefly sold at 5d. to 8¾d. ; 27 logs do. cedar, do. do. do., sold at 6½d. to 6¾d. ; 286 boards American whitewood, ash, and walnut, ex New York City, sold at 2d. to 3¼d., 2¾d. and 5d. respectively ; 5,369 squares American walnut, do., at 5s. 6d. to 6s. 9d. ; and 125 squares American ash, do., at 2s. 3d.
Messrs. CHURCHILL & SIM’s auction sale of mahogany and hardwoods at the “Baltic” on Thursday last brought together an unusually large number of buyers from all parts of the country, attracted by the superior quality of the goods offered. The Honduras mahogany was a prime lot of large-sized, straight, fine wood, and the Cuba cargo contained such a large variety of choice finely figured veneer logs as has not been offered for many years. Both cargoes were sold right out at very full prices.
578 logs Honduras mahogany, ex Morven, from Belize, all sold at 4¾d. to 1s. 9d. ; average 8d. per foot.
492 logs Cuba mahogany, ex Yruchulo, from Cardenas, all sold at 6d. to 8s. 3d. ; average 11½d. barely.
2 lots of St. Domingo mahogany curls, ex Nile, sold at 1s. 7d., and one lot at 1s. 1d.

8 lots mahogany boards at 5¾d. to 6¼d.
For the West India boxwood there was no bid.
MORE FROM AMERICA.—Acorns from America are in demand in Europe, says the Lumberman, for the propagation of oak forests. A special agent for the Forestry Department recently shipped 300 bushels of red oak acorns and 120 bushels of pig nuts to England and Germany, where they are to be planted next spring.
