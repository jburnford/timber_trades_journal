GANDY'S
PATENT COTTON BELTING.
Specially suited for and Patented in India and Abroad.

THE GANDY BELT.
Any Length or Width for Main Driving.
It is the best belt ever made for all purposes. Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather. Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, it clings well to the pulleys, runs true, and can be made any length without joints.
This Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley and Sons, Halifax, on May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.

Over 500,000 Feet
SOLD DURING 1882,
including 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, of widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe and America.

PRIZES.—HAMBURG, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURGH, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; MELBOURNE, 1880; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.

The following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.
Best Double Leather 6in. Belting | Breaking Strain per Square In. of Section. | Price per foot.
Gandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton | 3,572 lbs. | 5s. 7d.
... | 6,811 lbs. | 2s. 6d.

THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half the price of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy. The tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made of any width up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system of driving which it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. These Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially woven for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process to prevent stretching, which is so obvious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.

A SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.
