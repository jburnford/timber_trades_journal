  "text": "MARCH 31, 1883.] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 223\n\nThe weather still remains cold and severe for this season of the year, and hinders all outdoor labour, the building trade suffering most.\n\nCARDIFF.\nIn consequence of the numerous arrivals, prices for pitwood have very much fallen here, whereas on the other hand prices f.o.b. have stiffened at Bordeaux and the Brittany ports. Tonnage is fairly plentiful. There is little inquiry for tonnage from Quebec, and from the Baltic and White Sea things appear very slack. There is no inquiry and stocks are large. Two cargoes of Christiania floorings have come to hand this week. Large quantities of mining timber and props have lately arrived from Norway and Gothenburg; a good deal of this wood is, therefore, being landed, and prices have declined considerably.\n\nGLASGOW.\nThe consumption of wood goods of all descriptions is going on steadily here, saw-mills being pretty well employed, notwithstanding the quietness which still continues in housebuilding, so that stocks are not getting well reduced.\nThe imports to note for the past week are only one cargo of pitch pine timber and sundry small parcels of wood goods per New York liners. The spring supplies of pitch pine there have been unusually light. This year have been three cargoes imported, against twelve cargoes at corresponding period last year, and seventeen for the year before. A cargo of mahogany has just been landed here, the first of this year's import, and, as will be observed from advertisement column, is to be brought to auction on Tuesday next, 3rd proximo. A sale of some large parcels of American black walnut is to take place on same day following the above. A good attendance may be expected, the market having been unusually bare of these woods.\nThere are no public sales to report for the past week. The first ship from Greenock to St. John, N.B., sailed on 28th inst., and there are about twenty-one vessels preparing to sail in a few days for Quebec. Timber freights, Quebec to Clyde, are about 25s. 6d. Last year's spring fleet charters were not more than 24s.\n\nLEITH.\nThe only importation of wood goods to this port is a cargo of Porsgrund battens for Mr. J. Ellingsen. The weather for the past week or so has been very unfavourable for building operations, frost having again set in. With the exception of the one great storm, the season had been very open; now, however, operations in the outlying districts are again at a complete standstill. Trade is very quiet, with rather a downward tendency for Baltic stuffs. American yellow pine is still, however, remains high, and may probably go even higher, as the stock in this market (while sufficient for the present demand) is by no means large, and any improvement in the state of trade would likely lead to an advance in the price of this article.\n\nIMPORTS.\n[For the purpose of economizing space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.—ED.]\n\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nBARROW.\nMarch 24 Ophir-Porsgrund-414 lds. sawn fir, 4 lds. firewood-F.
