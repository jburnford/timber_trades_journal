FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
G. & C. ACOCK.—The bankrupts, who were contractors, carrying on business at East Dulwich, were adjudicated in October last, and they applied to the Court last week for their discharge, in pursuance of a special resolution passed by the creditors to the effect that their failure to pay a dividend of 10s. in the pound had arisen from circumstances for which they could not justly be held responsible. There was no objection, and Mr. Registrar Murray granted the discharge.
H. W. BUTCHER.—The debtor, who has presented a petition for liquidation, is described as of 6, Acacia Place, St. John's Wood, builder and decorator, trading as Henry Butcher. Mr. Wyate Hart applied to the court last week for the appointment of Mr. W. O. Altree, accountant, Gracechurch Street, as receiver of the estate, and for an injunction restraining further proceedings, at the suit of the following creditors:—Messrs. J. Barnard & Son, of Winsley Street, for the recovery of £50 4s. 2d.; J. Williams, 140, Queen Victoria Street, for £20 2s. 5d.; J. Phillips, 12, Circus Road, N.W., for £16 10s. 7d.; and Weston & Co., of St. Andrew's Wharf, Blackfriars, for £15 9s. 2d. The debts were about £350, and the assets were valued at £50, in addition to book debts. Mr. Registrar Murray made the appointment, and granted an injunction until after the first meeting, to be held on April 17th, at three o'clock, at the offices of Messrs. Peckham & Co., 17, Knightrider Street, E.C., the solicitors in the case.
The building trades experienced twenty-nine failures during last week, against twenty-eight in the corresponding week of last year. The whole number of failures during the same periods was 248, against 236, or twelve more last week.
