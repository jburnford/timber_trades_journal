JOHN, N.B.—The barque Ecuador, from Liverpool, reports passing through heavy ice. At one time was completely surrounded by large fields of ice, and to avoid them had to run the vessel back east, southerly course. One of the boats was smashed and some chain plates were carried away. The vessel's side was also badly chafed.",
