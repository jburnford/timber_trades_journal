CASUALTY.
The Red Sea, from New Orleans, arrived at Liverpool, reports that during a heavy gale on March 24th, a succession of heavy seas broke on board, smashing two lifeboats and washing adrift, and doing much other damage.
Among a list of fifty-six vessels reported under "casualties" at Lloyd's during the seven days, ending April 4th, not one ship was reported with timber cargo. There were five ships which lost all hands, and two others in which five and three of the crew were lost respectively. The total number of British and foreign sailing vessels thus registered up to date is 653, and of steamers 161, or total 814 in all.

The German barque Diamant, from Bremen, reports :—From March 16th, lat. 46 06, long. 46 17, till the 19th, lat. 43 42, long. 49 50, passed through a large quantity of field ice, and saw a number of large icebergs; was seven days west of the Banks with variable winds and weather.
ST. JOHN, N.B.—The barque Ecuador, from Liverpool, reports passing through heavy ice. At one time was completely surrounded by large fields of ice, and to avoid them had to run the vessel back east, southerly course. One of the boats was smashed and some chain plates were carried away. The vessel's side was also badly chafed.
