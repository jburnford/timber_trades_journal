FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
JAMES SNOOK.—The adjudication in this case was made in January, 1881, the bankrupt being then described as of Sylvan Cottage, Hornsey Rise, builder; and Mr. Aldridge, on behalf of the registrar-trustee, applied to the court last week for an order closing the bankruptcy. The liabilities were £1,024 19s., and no dividend had been paid. The late trustee (Mr. J. W. Reed) died in August last, and it appeared that there was then a balance of £75 in his hands, which was unaccounted for. Mr. Registrar Hazlitt ordered the bankruptcy to be closed.
A. H. A. SAUNDERS.—An adjourned meeting for public examination was held in this case on Tuesday before Mr. Registrar Pepys. The bankrupt, trading as a builder and contractor in Friern Road, East Dulwich, returned his liabilities at £1,939 17s. 2d. and debts fully secured £11,922 14s. 1d.; assets £179 15s. 11d. There was no opposition, and the bankrupt was allowed to pass his examination.
PARKMAN & HUTCHINSON.—An adjourned meeting for the public examination of the bankrupts, who were importers of railway sleepers and timber at 28, New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, took place last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The joint liabilities were returned at £5,621 1s. 4d., and assets £130. The separate debts of Parkman were £2,525 8s. 7d., and his assets were valued at £3,250. Hutchinson put down his separate debts (unsecured) at £75, and debts partly secured £2,054 15s. 10d. (the security being estimated at £300), with assets of the nominal value of £6,005. The accounts being only just filed, a further adjournment was ordered.
KIRKLAND & SON.—A petition for liquidation has been recently filed by Messrs. John Kirkland & Son, timber merchants of Dundee. The following is a list of the principal creditors :—

Individual members of Mr. John Kirkland's family also rank for large sums lent the firm, which claims are in some cases disputed. Claims to the amount of £1,400 are due to local wood merchants, railway companies, &c., in sums from £20 to £250.
WILLIAM HANCOCK.—The bankrupt, late of Lee, builder and contractor, but now of Stockwell Road, out of business, was adjudicated in October last, and he applied to the Court on Thursday for his order of discharge, the creditors at a meeting recently held passed a resolution that his failure to pay a dividend of 10s. in the £ had arisen from circumstances for which he could not justly be held responsible. The liabilities were stated in the accounts at £9,054, and debts fully secured £3,770. The trustee, Mr. H. W. Banks, appeared in person and consented to the application. Mr. Registrar Brougham granted the order of discharge.
H. W. BUTCHER.—The debtor, carrying on the business of a builder and decorator at 6, Acacia Place, St. John's Wood, has filed a petition for liquidation, estimating his liabilities at £350, the following being in the list of creditors :—
