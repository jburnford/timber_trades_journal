These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These “Gandy” Belts are made of any length up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pu’ley, a system of driving which is very unsatisfactory, as it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. These stoppages are avoided by using Gandy’s Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared at Baltimore for the purpose, by a process to prevent stretching and render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.\n\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\n\n[Image of a medal with text: VERBAND DEUTSCHER MULLER INTERNATIONALE AUSSTELLUNG BERLIN 1879]\n[Image of a medal with text: REGISTERED TRADE MARK GANDY'S AMERICAN BELTING]\n\nMAURICE GANDY\nPATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER,\n130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON\nWORKS: LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND,\nAND BALTIMORE, U.S.A\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nC.
