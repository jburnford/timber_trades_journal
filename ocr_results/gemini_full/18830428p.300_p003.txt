PENS.—The requirements and pleasure of every one who desires a good pen will, we should think, be met by the purchase of a small box of one of the many kinds brought out by that well-known firm, Macniven & Cameron, of Edinburgh. The samples before us certainly bear out the above statement.

THE “GANDY” BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, of London. These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These “Gandy” Belts are made of any length up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pu’ley, a system of driving which is very unsatisfactory, as it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. These stoppages are avoided by using Gandy’s Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared at Baltimore for the purpose, by a process to prevent stretching and render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.

A SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.
