New Zealand, 1882.\nTHE GANDY BELT.\nAny Length or Width for Main Driving.\nIt is the best belt ever made for all purposes\nMuch Cheaper and Stronger than Leather.\nThoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by\nTemperature, or changes of atmosphere. It clings well to the pulleys, runs\ntrue, and can be made any length without\njoints.\nThis Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley and\nSons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to\ngive entire satisfaction.\nOver 500,000 Feet\nSOLD DURING 1882,\nincluding 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, of\nfrom 14 in. to 60 in. are working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe\nand America.\nFirst Prize, Berlin, 1879.\nPRIZES.—HAMBURGH, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; NEW YORK, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1882; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.\nThe following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.\nBest Double Leather 6in. ... Breaking Strain per Square in. of Section. 3,572 lbs. Price per foot. 5s. 7d.\nGandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton Belting ... 6,811 lbs. 2s. 6d.\nTHE \"GANDY\" BELT.\nGANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, of London. These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These \"Gandy\" Belts are made of any width up to 72 inches, and without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, as is a system of driving which is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. These stoppages are avoided by using Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared by a process to prevent stretching and to render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nMAURICE GANDY, PATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER,\n130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON,\nWORKS: LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND, AND BALTIMORE, U.S.A",
