THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, of London. These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made of any width up to 72 inches, and without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, as is a system of driving which is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. These stoppages are avoided by using Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared by a process to prevent stretching and to render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.
A SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.
