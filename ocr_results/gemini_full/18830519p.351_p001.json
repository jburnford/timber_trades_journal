Rayner & Moller) are the only pitwood cargoes that have come forward.\nOne large vessel with 1,300 loads from Mobile for Messrs. William Briggs & Sons, and a smaller one with 750 loads from Doboy, sold, but since purchased by a local firm, complete the imports since our last article; two or three cargoes of oak and about half a dozen with deals are, however, daily expected.\nTrade, generally speaking, remains much about the same, and no rise has yet taken place.\nSeveral large deal contracts for summer and autumn shipment have just been closed at spring quotations, a result which hardly bears out our previous ideas of prices for later deliveries; we also understand several cargoes of oak timber have been placed as low as 1d. per cubic foot less than spring sales.\nFreights remain steady, the last business done being: Gefle, two vessels, 29s.; Memel, 20s.; Riga, North Dock, 9s.\n\nGLASGOW.\nAt the auction sale held here on the 16th inst., which was only moderately attended, the goods offered comprised 1st quality Michigan pine deals of large dimensions, Quebec pine deals, and St. John, N.B., spruce.\nThere was a want of competition for the pine deals, and prices were not brought up to a satisfactory figure in the seller's view.\nOnly one lot of the Michigan was sold publicly, remainder withdrawn.\nAll the spruce deals offered were disposed of, but at rather lower rates than were ruling last sale.\nThe packing box trade is quiet at present, which affects the demand for spruce, and it is also to be noted that there is a large arrival of spruce deals now landing here ex steamer.\nAs regards Quebec goods the trade apparently are waiting for fresh importations, when it is to be expected that larger combines will be attracted and give prices a decided start upwards.\nMeantime the market is not buoyant.\nRecent deliveries of deals from Yorkhill yards here show little difference in quantity compared with same time last year.\nThe number of deals delivered last month was 68,826 pcs., and in April, 1882, 64,353 pcs.\nSince the beginning of the present month deliveries have been lighter than usual.\nThe shipbuilders are busy taking in supplies of log timber, sales of which have been made privately, and prices not transpired.\nThe sales of the past week include a cargo of Quebec timber, besides pitch pine timber, Norwegian battens, and a large supply of oak and staves.\n\nAUCTION SALE.\nOn 10th inst. at Glasgow, Messrs. Sinnad, Dunn, & Co., brokers:—\n1st yellow pine deals—\n9 to 11 ft. 11/24 x 3 3s. per c. ft.\n1st spruce deals—\n10 to 20 ft. 16/18 x 3 10d. „\n17 „ 29 „ 15 x 3 10d. „\n14 „ 29 „ 11 x 3 11d. „\n10 „ 15 „ 11 x 3 10½d. „\n23 „ 29 „ 9 x 3 10½d. „\n12 „ 21 „ 9 x 3 10¼d. „\n10 & 11 „ 9 x 3 10¼d. „\n20 to 26 „ 8 x 3 10d. „\n\nLEITH.\nThe import list at this port is a blank for the past week.\nA slight briskness has been perceptible lately, but this may be only transient at the present season.\nNo definite improvement can, however, be looked for until the property market recovers somewhat from its present depressed condition.\nSeveral sales have been held last week; others are, however, announced for next week.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economizing space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.—ED.]\nBARNSTAPLE.\nMay 9 La Plata-Fredrikstadt-30,913 boards-How & Co.\nBRIDGWATER.\nMay 9 Ocean-Fredrikshald-24,598 flooring boards, 1,351 deals, 5,276 mouldings -Colthurst & Co.\nCARDIFF.\nMay 9 Gironde (s)-Bordeaux-700 lds. pitwood-P.
