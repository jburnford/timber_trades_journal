and other employers of labour are not in full working order yet, and not likely to be until beginning of next week.
This state of things has been partly brought about by the fine weather of the past few days; consequently timber deliveries are less than they otherwise would have been.
Imports are not quite so numerous as we usually find them at this season of the year.
Since our last report we have no Baltic arrivals to chronicle.
Two of the usual Gothenburg traders with about 1,200 loads assorted goods, and two sailers with about 800 loads props (the latter for Messrs. Rayner & Moller) are the only pitwood cargoes that have come forward.
One large vessel with 1,300 loads from Mobile for Messrs. William Briggs & Sons, and a smaller one with 750 loads from Doboy, sold, but since purchased by a local firm, complete the imports since our last article; two or three cargoes of oak and about half a dozen with deals are, however, daily expected.
Trade, generally speaking, remains much about the same, and no rise has yet taken place.
Several large deal contracts for summer and autumn shipment have just been closed at spring quotations, a result which hardly bears out our previous ideas of prices for later deliveries; we also understand several cargoes of oak timber have been placed as low as 1d. per cubic foot less than spring sales.
Freights remain steady, the last business done being: Gefle, two vessels, 29s.; Memel, 20s.; Riga, North Dock, 9s.

GLASGOW.
At the auction sale held here on the 16th inst., which was only moderately attended, the goods offered comprised 1st quality Michigan pine deals of large dimensions, Quebec pine deals, and St. John, N.B., spruce.
There was a want of competition for the pine deals, and prices were not brought up to a satisfactory figure in the seller's view.
Only one lot of the Michigan was sold publicly, remainder withdrawn.
All the spruce deals offered were disposed of, but at rather lower rates than were ruling last sale.
The packing box trade is quiet at present, which affects the demand for spruce, and it is also to be noted that there is a large arrival of spruce deals now landing here ex steamer.
As regards Quebec goods the trade apparently are waiting for fresh importations, when it is to be expected that larger combines will be attracted and give prices a decided start upwards.
Meantime the market is not buoyant.
Recent deliveries of deals from Yorkhill yards here show little difference in quantity compared with same time last year.
The number of deals delivered last month was 68,826 pcs., and in April, 1882, 64,353 pcs.
Since the beginning of the present month deliveries have been lighter than usual.
The shipbuilders are busy taking in supplies of log timber, sales of which have been made privately, and prices not transpired.
The sales of the past week include a cargo of Quebec timber, besides pitch pine timber, Norwegian battens, and a large supply of oak and staves.

LEITH.
The import list at this port is a blank for the past week.
A slight briskness has been perceptible lately, but this may be only transient at the present season.
No definite improvement can, however, be looked for until the property market recovers somewhat from its present depressed condition.
Several sales have been held last week; others are, however, announced for next week.
