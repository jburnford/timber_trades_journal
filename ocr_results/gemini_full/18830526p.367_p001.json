  "text": "MAY 26, 1883.]\narrivals have created a great amount of activity in the delivery and forwarding, and in every branch it may be reported that more is being done. For new goods there is more demand, and as old stocks have been well cleared lately the new arrivals come to a fair market. Building operations, more especially in the riverside villages, are very brisk, and in contracting several works of more or less importance are in hand. The outlook is certainly very much brighter at the present time.\n\nSUNDERLAND.\nThe mining timber and pitwood trade still remain in the same miserable condition, the arrivals being considerably in excess of the deliveries. Large quantities of props continue to be stored, so much so that the River Wear Commissioners have some difficulty in apportioning suitable discharging berths. Several contracts have been taken within the past few days at prices which, we think, are without parallel. Whether by merchants who are not in a position to hold their stocks, or not, we have not information before us to say. One thing, however, is certain in this particular trade, and that is, that the outlook is an exceedingly gloomy one, and the prospect we held out earlier in the year of an advance in prices for summer shipments appears more remote to-day than it did two months ago.\nThe import list for the past seven days is better than what we had to report last week, viz., fifteen sailing vessels and one steamer (with part cargo), making a total import for the week of nearly 5,000 loads, composed as follows:—Messrs. Rayner & Moller, two cargoes, 450 loads; Messrs. Misabel, Pedersen, & Co., Messrs. Calder Brothers, and Messrs. L. Torkildsen & Co., one cargo each of from 200 to 300 loads; two cargoes of 400 loads to order, and 200 loads by one of the Lambton steamers for one company, all props and other timber for mining purposes; one small cargo of 200 loads sleepers from Dantzig to order; four cargoes Memel deals; 1,200 loads for shipbuilding purposes, 500 loads of which are for Messrs. Short Brothers, 250 loads, Mr. Alfred Oswald, 220 loads, Messrs. M. Robson & Son; and 230 loads for Messrs. Wm. Wealand Robson & Sons. Messrs. Short Brothers have two cargoes of hewn oak plank logs, 400 loads from Stettin and 400 loads from Dantzig. 600 loads deals and battens have come forward from Stockholm for Messrs. John Thompson & Sons and Messrs. Curry, Carrs, & Co. It appears this cargo was loaded late last season, and ice setting in, the vessel wintered there. We understand Messrs. Curry, Carrs, & Co., of Newcastle, who own large forests in the neighbourhood of Stockholm, are about to enter an action against the captain for not “proceeding with all reasonable dispatch” after being loaded. This will be a case of some importance, and the decision will be looked forward to with no little anxiety.\nIn sawnwood goods there is no change to report. Stocks are still decreasing, and prices may be fairly classed as firm. We have not heard of any vessel loading at any of the Gulf ports for this place, but with the opening of the navigation, and several ships being on the passage, it cannot be many weeks before this season’s goods are in the market. The Doboy cargo referred to last week was bought by Messrs. Short Bros.\n\nCARDIFF.\nThere are no more satisfactory features to report in connection with any of the branches of our timber trade. For the colliery demand a fair amount of tonnage has come in, but stocks being already replete, prices show no tendency towards an upward movement, and this department of business presents at the moment no attraction whatever to the speculator. Free-on-board prices in France are fairly maintained at higher figures than consort with the figures realizing here. In the general timber trade there is no improvement, business being dull and operations limited. The arrivals since our last have consisted of one cargo of sleepers from Konigsberg, and pitwood as follows:—Bordeaux, 850 loads; Vannes, 295; Nantes, 240; Arcachon, 225; L’Orient, 228; Auray, 179; Lorient, 112; La Rochelle, 115 Corunna, 1,273; Carril, 150; Villagarcia, 450; Waterford, 436; Youghal, 120; Barnstaple, 30.\n\nGREAT GRIMSBY.\nThe timber trade at this port has now made a fair start, several ships from Memel and Stettin having arrived with cargoes of oak and fir timber, one cargo of crown oak being very good. The principal importers are Messrs. Price, Potter, & Walker, Marshall & Atkinson, and Ellis & Son. Prices are firm, and business very brisk. No arrivals yet from Riga.\n\nGLASGOW.\nThe past week may be counted as the opening of the early summer market. There have been numerous arrivals to Clyde, as will be observed from the import list; and on the 23rd inst., as noted below, a public sale was held in Yorkhill Yard, here, the goods offered consisting of a large fresh cargo of birch and maple logs, also St. John, N.B., and Halifax, N.S., spruce deals. The stock of last year’s birch had been exhausted for a long time past, and this fresh cargo was expected to prove an attraction at the opening of the season; yet, although a good company was present, there was little spirited bidding for the birch or for deals. As noted below, the birch was not of large squares, so that the rates realized appear to be an improvement on last year’s prices. A bid of 16d. for maple was given, but as the brokers were unable to obtain an advance on this figure, the wood was withdrawn.\nApparently, from the present weak demand for spruce deals, the supply meantime may be considered ample. Besides the sales of birch appended there were some made privately.\n\nAUCTION SALE.\nOn 23rd inst., at Glasgow, Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co., brokers:—\nHalifax birch (squares, string measure, ranging from 13 to 21 in. and avg. 15 to 16 in.)\n400 logs 18½d. & 19d. per c. ft.\n140 „ 19½d. & 19¾d. „\n40 „ 20½d. & 21d. „\nHalifax spruce deals—\n9 to 21 ft. 13/14 x 3 10½d. per c. ft.\n9 „ 21 „ 12 x 3 11d. „\n9 „ 21 „ 11 x 3 11½d. „\nDo. ends—\n3 to 8 ft. 7/14 x 3 8½d. „\n\nLEITH.\nThe importations during the past week consist of one cargo Dantzic timber, one of Memel, and two cargoes deals and battens, one of the latter having also a consignment of flooring boards. There have been no public sales held during the past week; several are, however, announced for the beginning of June.\nWe regret having to announce that Messrs. Philip & Son, Bowling Green Sawmills, Great Junction Street, Leith, have issued a circular to their creditors suspending payment. This firm, although chiefly engaged in the home wood trade, had still a considerable turn-over of Baltic goods. The total liabilities are not, however, expected to be large. In the meantime a composition has been offered, which may be accepted.\n\nCANALS.—The Florida Ship Canal Company has been organised at Washington, with 26,000,000 dols. subscribed capital, to construct a canal across Florida, deep enough for the largest ships, between the St. John’s and Suwanee rivers. The work will be commenced in September next.\n\nEPPS’S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.—“By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors’ bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.”—Civil Service Gazette.—Made simply with boiling water or milk.
