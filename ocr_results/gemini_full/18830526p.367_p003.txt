FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases
creditors whose names are published in these
lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for
the full amount.]
FREDERICK SNELLING.—The debtor is described as of the Imperial Hotel, Margate; and 46, Devonshire
Chambers, Bishopsgate, builder and hotel keeper. He has filed a petition for liquidation, and Mr. H. Smallman applied, on Tuesday, for the appointment of Mr. E. P. Wilson, accountant, 11, Old Jewry Chambers, as receiver of the estate, and for an injunction restraining further proceedings in various actions. The liabilities were returned at £100,000, and the assets were estimated at about the same amount, consisting of freehold and leasehold property, shares in companies, and book debts. The debtor was being sued by the following creditors :—The London and South Western Bank, for the recovery of £81 15s. 3d.; Saunders & Co. (Limited), 11, Jermyn Street, for £50 1s.; Baylis & Pearce, Old Jewry, for £7,240 (execution issued and partly satisfied); William Wood, of Chelmsford, for £130 8s. 6d.; A. J. Mann, of Lott's Road, Chelsea, for £31 3s. 6d.; G. H. Lamb, of Dartmouth Park Hill, for £100 8s. 11d.; the West London Commercial Bank, for £50 1s. 7d.; Edward Taylor, of Shepherd's Lane, Brixton, for £36 18s. 10d.; F. W. Farmiloe, of Rochester Row, Westminster, for £144 14s. 3d.; and F. Betts, 33, York Street, London Road, for £49 10s. 5d. Mr. Registrar Pepys made the desired appointment, and granted an injunction, except as to the action at the suit of Messrs. Bayliss & Pearce, in which it appeared that a writ of elegit had been issued prior to the filing of the petition.
—The debtor, George Henry G. H. List, of City Chambers, Ropemaker Street, Finsbury; King Street, Borough; and Central Hill, Upper Norwood, builder and contractor, has presented a petition for liquidation, and Mr. H. Montague applied to the Court on Tuesday for the appointment of a receiver and manager of the estate, and for an injunction restraining proceedings by creditors. The affidavit of the debtor in support of the application set forth that he had for several years past been engaged in the erection of artisans' dwellings in King Street, Borough, and had also other building operations on hand, which ought to be carried on without interruption. His liabilities, including amounts due on mortgages, were about £41,000, and his assets, including the mortgaged properties, were estimated at £46,000, or thereabouts. He was the owner, subject to mortgages, of various freehold and leasehold properties, in respect of which matters were constantly arising which required attention, and there were also wages payable to workmen weekly. He was being sued by the following creditors :—Messrs. Rochford, Mount, & Dell, 40, King William Street, E.C., for the recovery of £168 11s. 8d.; William Porter, 1A, Arthur Street, E.C., for £112 0s. 8d.; J. J. Hick- End Road, for £42 13s. 9d.; Broadway, Stratford, for £33 Bishop & Co., of Norwich, for & Burn, of Long Acre, for the Capital & Counties Bank 30 8s. 6d.; G. Farmiloe & Sons, for £50 7s. 4d.; the United Limited), Norfolk Street, W.C.
