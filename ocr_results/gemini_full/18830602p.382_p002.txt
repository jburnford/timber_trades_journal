SIR-Gen. W. H. SMITH, late of Ringwood, says "I used several pints of your Protected Alkaline Composition, for the purpose of removing old paint and varnish from OAK, both plain and carved, and found it most admirable stuff for the purpose, as it leaves a uniform warm brown colour without hurting the grain and stringle marks." Sample and price free from F. WILSON & Co., Stowmarket.—Advt.
