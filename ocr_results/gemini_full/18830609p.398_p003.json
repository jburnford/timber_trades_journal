Belting ......\nGandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton ......\n\nGANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular. Its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy. These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These \"Gandy\" Belts are made of any width up to 240 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system of driving which is always causing a stoppage. By using Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially woven for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special machinery and process to prevent slipping, and render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.\n\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\n\nMAURICE GANDY, PATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER,\nWORKS: LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND AND BALTIMORE, U.S.A.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.

Williams-Jones, of Liverpool.\n\nHENRY DRIVER.—The adjourned public case was made in September, the bankrupt being then described as of South Lodge, Mitcham Common, builder and contractor, and the trustees applied to the Court last week for an order closing the bankruptcy. The liabilities were stated in the statement at £6,297 7s. 11d. and debts unsecured £5,697 1s. 11d. The trustees, however, found that the assets were incapable of realisation for the benefit of the creditors, and Mr. Registrar Brougham made the order.\n\nEDMUND BYE.—An adjourned meeting for public examination was held in this case last week before Mr. Registrar Murray. The bankrupt, late of Westhall Road, Forest Hill, but now of no occupation, was adjudicated on March 8th, and furnished a statement of affairs setting forth unsecured debts £4,500, and debts fully secured £4,500, and debts partly secured £3,950 8s. 4d. (the securities being valued at £2,550); total amount of liabilities £4,222 17s. 1d. Assets—surplus from securities —£410. The following were the principal secured creditors :—\nBanks H.

W. Banks, stated that in August, 1881, the bankrupt filed a petition for liquidation, and resolutions were passed for the acceptance of a composition of 4s. in the pound. It appeared that in the previous month of June he had parted with a public-house known as the Moor Park Tavern to his son for about £4,000. The bankrupt was examined as to the circumstances under which he had disposed of the Moor Park Tavern, and he gave his opinion that his answers were perfect examination.\n\nSIMON CAUDLE.—A meeting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Murray. The bankrupt, late of 4, Munster Terrace, Fulham, had returned his liabilities at £3,297 10s. 1d., and debts fully secured £16,400; assets £1,500. No opposition was offered, and the Registrar allowed the bankrupt to pass his examination.\n\nG. H. LAW.—This case has been reported in the Timber Trades Journal. The debtor, described as of City Chambers, Fenchurch Street, Finsbury; King Street, Finsbury; and Central Hill, Upper Norwood, builder and contractor, having filed a petition for liquidation.",
