THE HULL AND LINCOLN RAILWAY.
At the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Hull and Lincoln Railway, at Westminster, on Wednesday last, two members of the timber trade were examined in reference to the proposed bridge across the river.
Mr. William H. Maude, Leeds, said that he imported large quantities of timber, and if his vessels could not come to Goole it would make a difference of 2s. a load in the cost.
Mr. Samuel Ingham, of the firm of Messrs. Illingworth, Ingham, & Co., said that up till 1880 they imported their timber into Hull, but since that time had brought it into Goole. They now chartered everything they could to Goole. The total imports of timber into that port had increased from 4,628 tons in 1880 to 12,375 tons in 1882, and their own imports this year would be more than the total last year. He believed that the construction of this bridge would practically close Goole to them, as it would make freights almost prohibitory.

A TREE standing perpendicularly has been discovered at a depth of 280 ft. in boring an artesian well at San Bernardino, California. Great pieces of wood, which appear to be sycamore, are brought up.
WILLOWS.—It is mentioned, says the Chicago Lumberman, in advocating the white willow as a profitable tree for planting, that one is growing at Stockbridge, Mass., which measures 22 ft. in circumference four feet from the ground, while its branches extend 50 ft. In England the willow often grows to a height of 50 to 60 ft. in twenty years. There it is much esteemed because the wood is light, very tough, takes a good finish, and will bear more hard knocks than any other wood. It is used for floats to steamer paddle-wheels, brake blocks on cars, cricket bats, turning purposes, planking, vessel furniture, ox yokes, wooden legs and shoe lasts.
"FIFTY YEARS HENCE."—"If the various countries maintain their present rate of increase," says Mr. Gosselin, Secretary of Embassy at Berlin, "fifty years hence the United States will have a population of 190,000,000, Russia approximately 158,000,000, Germany 83,000,000, the United Kingdom 63,000,000, Austria-Hungary and Italy both 44,000,000, France only 40,000,000. Germany has already in round numbers 7,500,000 more inhabitants than France, but in this reckoning Algeria is not taken into account." For war purposes, however, it is observed that the balance is not so heavily against France, for whereas in Germany there are only 965 males to every thousand females, in France there are 991. Germany has, therefore, only 3½ millions of males more than France.
BATH HEATING. To save the trouble and the expense of fixing pipes to kitchen ranges, to avoid the risk of explosion and the other difficulties connected with the old method of bath heating; to have hot water always at hand, and to be able to procure boiling water in two or three minutes at any hour of the day or night; it is only necessary to have a water heater of proper construction fixed near the bath with a gas pipe laid on. But it is very important to see that this water heater is of thoroughly good material as well as of best construction. The New Crown boiler made by Ewart & Son, of Euston Road, is perhaps as perfect as this kind of apparatus can be, and being made wholly of copper and brass is very durable; in fact, may be considered of permanent value. It is also of an ornamental character, and fit for placing in any bathroom without disfiguring it.—Advt.
