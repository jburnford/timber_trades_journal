MESSRS. FARNWORTH & JARDINE'S latest circular, just received, says:-The arrivals of mahogany during the past fortnight have been one cargo from Tabasco and one cargo from Cuba; the demand is not so brisk, and the recent sales have had a downward tendency. Honduras of good quality and sizes sells readily; but small and crooked wood is lower in value. Tabasco mahogany is in fair request, but prices at the recent sale were easier; the market is quite bare. Of Mina there is none in stock; the late sales showed some little decline in value, more particularly for small wood. St. Domingo mahogany has been imported sparingly for some time, and sales have been insignificant; a cargo of Porto Plata just arrived is advertised for sale on the 15th. Cuba mahogany is in fair request, and a cargo of fresh sizeable wood would command some attention. Cedar from Honduras, Mexico, &c., continues in active demand, and there is no change in value. Pencilwood is very little inquired for, and present stock is sufficient. Walnut: American continues active, and prices are high. Italian and Circassian in little demand, and prices rule low. Burrs are quite unsaleable unless quite fresh and of good shape and colour; even for these the demand is very limited. Rosewood is very dull of sale, and the stock, though light, is sufficient. Satinwood is saleable to a moderate extent at fair prices; there is none in stock. Bird-eyed maple is seldom asked for, and sales have been very insignificant for a long time past. Lignumvitæ of prime quality, thin sap, and of good sizes commands good prices, but small and inferior wood is more difficult to move and prices are lower. Lancewood spars are in good demand, and with a light import of late prices have improved.
