GANDY'S
PATENT COTTON BELTING
Specially suited for and Patented in India and Abroad.

THE GANDY BELT.
Any Length or Width for Main Driving.
It is the best belt ever made for all purposes.
Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather.
Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, clings well to the pulleys, runs true, and can be made any length without joints.
This Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley & Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.

OVER 500,000 Feet
SOLD DURING 1882,
including 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts from 14 in. to 60 in. size width, and working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in the United Kingdom and America.

PRIZES.—HAMBURG, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1881; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.
The following Tests (by David Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.
Best Double Leather 6in. Belting ... Breaking Strain per Square In. of Section. 3,572 lbs. Price per foot. 5s. 7d.
Gandy's 6 in. 8-ply American Cotton ... 6,811 lbs. 2s. 6d.

THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular.
Its strength and gripping power is double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests given above, to which special attention is directed.
These "Gandy" Belts are made of any length without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, as it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage.
Gandy's Patent Belts in one width.
These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process to render them impervious to water and atmospheric influence.
Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts is only a question of time.

A SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.
