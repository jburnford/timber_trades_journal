THE GANDY BELT.

Over 500,000 Feet
SOLD DURING 1882,
Including 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, of widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe and America.

THE GANDY BELT.
Is unique in every particular ; its cost being about half that of Leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, of London. "Belts are made of any width up to 72 inches, and run true on the same pulley, a system of driving which is impossible with any other is always causing a stoppage. These celebrated Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared for the purpose by special Machinery and process to prevent stretching and shrinking, hence, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.
