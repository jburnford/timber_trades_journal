MAHOGANY AND HARDWOODS
Messrs. CHALONER & Co's. latest circular says:—There have not been any recent auction sales, and prices are without change. St. Domingo: Logs of large to medium sizes have been in fair request of late, but for small wood there has been less inquiry. The supply of veneer mahogany has been limited for some time past, and early imports will realize full prices. Well-grown curls, 2 to 5 ft. long, are saleable, but there is a limited demand for other descriptions. Cuba: The stock is exhausted, and a desirable cargo would here find a good market. Honduras: There was a very good demand at the last auction sales for straight and sound logs of large to medium diameters, but crooked and defective wood was only in moderate request. The present stock (117 logs) is old and faulty. Mexican: Tabasco wood of large to medium sizes has been in very fair request for some time past, but now there is less demand for small dimensions. Minatitlan, &c.: There was a very fair demand at the last auction sale, which took place five weeks ago. The stock is light, say one small cargo from Tlacotalpam. Cedar from Honduras, Mexico, and Cuba is in active request at full prices. The stock is very light. Pencil Cedar is in moderate demand. Walnut: Italian is dull of sale. Circassian: There has not been any demand lately for logs. Fresh, well-grown burrs, of the best quality, are saleable, but there has not been any inquiry for old shipments of poor to medium quality. American black walnut is in good demand. Bird-eyed maple: No inquiries. Lignum-vitae from the cuttings of City St. Domingo is in request, and early supplies of round, sound, fresh, thin-sap wood, of desirable sizes will command ready sale at full prices. Other descriptions are only in moderate request.

BATH HEATING.—To save the trouble and expense of fixing pipes to kitchen ranges, to avoid the risk of explosion and the other difficulties connected with the old method of bath heating; to have hot water always at hand, and to be able to procure boiling water in two or three minutes at any hour of the day or night; it is only necessary to have a water heater of proper construction fixed near the bath with a gas pipe laid on. But it is very important to see that this water heater is of thoroughly good material as well as of best construction. The New Crown boiler is made by Ewart & Son, of Euston Road, is perhaps as perfect as this kind of apparatus can be, and being made wholly of copper and brass is very durable; in fact, it may be considered of permanent value. It is also of an ornamental character, and fit for placing in any bathroom without disfiguring it. --Advt.
