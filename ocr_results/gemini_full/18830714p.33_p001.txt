BATH HEATING.—To save the trouble and
expense of fixing pipes to kitchen ranges, to
avoid the risk of explosion and the other difficulties
connected with the old method of
heating; to have hot water always at hand,
to be able to procure boiling water in two or
three minutes at any hour of the day or night;
it is only necessary to have a water heater of
proper construction fixed near the bath with a
pipe laid on. But it is very important to
see that this water heater is of thoroughly good
material as well as of best construction. The
New Crown boiler is made by Ewart & Son, of
Euston Road, is perhaps as perfect as this kind
of apparatus can be, and being made wholly of
copper and brass is very durable; in fact, it
may be considered of permanent value. It is
of an ornamental character, and is a decided
fit for any bathroom without disfiguring it.
