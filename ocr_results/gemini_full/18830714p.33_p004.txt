GANDY'S PATENT COTTON BELTING.
Specially suited for and Patented in India and Abroad.
THE NEW GANDY BELT.
Any Length or Width for Main Driving.
It is the best belt ever made for all purposes. Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather. Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, clings well to the pulleys, runs true, and can be made any length without joints.
This Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley and Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.
OVER 500,000 Feet SOLD DURING 1882,
Including 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe and America.

THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular. Its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, of London. These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made of any width up to 60 inches, and 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system of driving which is always causing a stoppage. It is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is doing all the work. Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially made for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process to prevent stretching, and to render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belting is only a question of time.
A SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.
