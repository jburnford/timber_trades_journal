THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, of London. These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made of any length up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system of driving which it is impossible to have satisfactory, as it is impossible to have two belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. These joints are avoided by using Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special machinery and process to prevent stretching, and they render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption is a question of time.
A SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.
