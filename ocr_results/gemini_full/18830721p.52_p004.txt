[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
GEORGE SUMMERS.—A meeting of the creditors of George Summers, of Saltley Road, Birmingham, builder, was held last week at the office of Mr. Edwin Jaques, solicitor, Temple Row.
Mr. M. Bayley, solicitor, was voted to the chair.
The statement of affairs produced showed : due to unsecured creditors, £397 14s.; creditors fully secured, £3,397 19s. 2d.; less estimated value of securities, £3,800; and assets, consisting of surplus from securities in the hands of creditors, £402 0s. 10d., and stock-in-trade, £9, making total assets (less payments in full £12 2s. 8d.), £398 18s. 2d.
Mr. Jaques explained that the debtor was unable to make any reasonable offer of composition, and it was therefore resolved to liquidate the estate by arrangement, and Mr. Joseph H. Peace, of Temple Street, chartered accountant, was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection.
NOSOTTI & Co.—A meeting of the creditors of Charles Francis Nosotti, Frederick Chandler, and Charles F. Husband, trading as Nosotti & Co., of Oxford Street, &c., cabinetmakers, upholsterers, &c., was held last week at the Guildhall Tavern.

After some discussion, the debtors being asked if they had any propositions to make, and none being offered, it was moved that the estate should be liquidated by arrangement, and Mr. Percy Mason and Mr. L. Launspach be appointed trustees.
Mr. Barber, solicitor, on behalf of Messrs. Newman, Smith, & Co., and others, suggested that a second accountant should be appointed, and the chairman suggested that Mr. Viney, accountant, should be associated with Mr. Mason.
The motion was agreed to.
It was then moved and seconded that Mr. E. Zuccani, 40, Brick Lane; Mr. George Sims, 170, Aldersgate Street; Mr. Charles L. Nightingale, Wardour Street; Mr. Edward Monday, 8, Hart Street, Wood Street; and Mr. Birkett, 4, Great Suffolk Street, Borough, should be appointed a committee of inspection, with Messrs.
