John Crossley and Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.\nOVER 500,000 Feet SOLD DURING 1882,\nIncluding 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, of widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe and America.\nFirst Prize, Berlin, 1879\nPRIZES.—HAMBURG, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1882; NEW YORK, 1880; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.\nThe following Tests (by Messrs.

Price per foot. 5s. 7d.\nGandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton ... Breaking Strain per Square In. of Section. 6,811 lbs. ... Price per foot. 2s. 6d.\nTHE \"GANDY\" BELT.\nGANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, of London.\nThese Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed.\nThese \"Gandy\" Belts are made of any width up to 140 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulleys, a system of driving which is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage.\nThese stoppages are avoided by using Gandy's Patent Belts in one width.\nThese Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery to render them impervious to water or atmospheric influence.\nPossessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nMAURICE GANDY.
