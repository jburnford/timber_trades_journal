The failure took place in April, the liabilities being £38,789, and the assets £16,235.
Since the bankruptcy an offer on behalf of the bankrupt to pay his creditors a composition of 8s. had been accepted, and was now waiting the approval of the court.
The composition is payable in equal instalments in two, four, and six months from the approval by the court.
These facts having been mentioned to the court, and there being no opposition, the bankrupt was allowed to pass his public examination.

Liabilities £616 19s., and secured debts £2,043; assets £996 10s., of which £987 was the estimated surplus from securities.
It was resolved that the estate should be liquidated by arrangement, and Mr. H. Dade, of 9, Idol Lane, was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection, namely, Mr. Octavius Buss, of Blenheim Street, and Mr. Charles Bird, of South Wharf, Paddington.

The debtor, who has filed a petition for liquidation, is a contractor and brick merchant, cowkeeper and dairyman, carrying on business at 21, West Street, Mile End Old Town, Morning Lane, Hackney, and the Dust Wharf, Stratford.
Mr. Hatchett Jones applied for the appointment of Mr. William Murdoch, accountant, 80, Cornhill, as receiver and manager of the estate, and for an injunction restraining various actions.
The liabilities were estimated at about £20,000, and the assets at £6,000.
The debtor was being sued by Mr. A. Martin, 4, Devonshire Road, Forest Hill, for the recovery of £81 15s.; Messrs. Muggeridge & Sharp, of Catherine Court, for £56 12s. 4d.; P. A.

Alloway, of the Jamaica Coffee House, Cornhill, for £500.
Mr. Jones said that there were seventy horses engaged on contract work, and there were cows kept by the debtor in his business of a dairyman, which had to be milked and attended to.
The appointment of a manager as well as of a receiver was therefore indispensable, but he had not yet had time to obtain the consent of creditors.
His Honour, under the exceptional circumstances, appointed Mr. Murdoch manager as well as receiver upon the understanding that steps were at once taken to obtain the concurrence of creditors.
He also granted an injunction until after the first meeting, to be held on Friday, August 10th, at two o'clock, at the New Corn Exchange Tavern, Mark Lane.

OVER 500,000 Feet SOLD DURING 1882,

THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, of London.
These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed.
These "Gandy" Belts are made of any width up to 140 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulleys, a system of driving which is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage.
These stoppages are avoided by using Gandy's Patent Belts in one width.
These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery to render them impervious to water or atmospheric influence.
Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.
