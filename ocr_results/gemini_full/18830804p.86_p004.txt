A COMING REVOLUTION IN THE LONDON COAL TRADE.
IT is stated that the Great Eastern steam ship, after lying idly at anchor for several years, is at length to be employed. A company has been formed to purchase the vessel for the coal trade between Queen's Ferry (Firth of Forth) and the Thames. It is intended to put 20,000 tons of coal on board, in sacks, at each voyage. The vessel is described as being in splendid order, having been carefully and expensively maintained. From the calculations of the projectors of the new undertaking, the maximum price of coal delivered into consumers' houses in London is hereafter, is assumed to be 15s. per ton.
If this report be verified, the destiny of the Great Eastern may have been, after all, to revolutionize the coal trade of London, and to institute a new order of things in that important branch of trade. Also by this system a little impulse will be given to the sack-making business, as at the first going off 200,000 sacks will be required. These sacks being obviously intended to go direct from the ship to the consumer without disturbance of the contents, will have to be replaced by an equal number from the immediate consignee, as to keep the ship waiting while her cargo is distributed to the public is not to be thought of. At 5s. per ton freight, the ship would make £5,000 per voyage, and allowing her to make twelve voyages per annum, the gross freight would be £60 000, and the gross delivery to London in the year by this ship 240,000 tons. Such a quantity of Scotch coal coming on the market, where it has been heretofore little known, will doubtless bring down the price of the old-established collieries, for though swifter to burn away, it makes excellent fires, and can be used with economy by those who are familiar with its properties.
It would not have surprised us if this enormous ship had been bought up for the timber instead of the coal trade. Nor would she have caused any panic or depression of prices by the announcement. The more distant voyages and slower process of loading and discharging would have reduced the number of her trips probably to four or five per annum, and admitting the latter figure she would allow add 100,000 loads altogether. If we allow her to stow 20,000 loads each time it would take twelve of her cargoes to make up the deficiency of the supply in the first six months of this year, as compared with those of 1882, or at the rate of voyage we have computed, two and a half years' work. In point of earnings or gross freight from Gefle to London, for instance, at 10s. per load, she would not earn more than £50,000 per annum on the assumed basis. So that the coal trade seems to promise best for her employment, all things considered. This great ship came before her time, twenty-seven years ago. She was then too big for any ordinary trade, but people's ideas of shipbuilding and commerce have greatly expanded since that time, and in about another decade of years, according to the rate of progress in this department during the last ten, the Great Eastern may come into use as a nice handy ship for fetching timber from Quebec, arrangements being by that date perfected to the extent of loading and discharging about 10,000 loads per day. Nor is this idea so ridiculous as it may appear to the unconscious reader. To discharge ten standards ex ship was formerly considered a fair days' work, and bills of lading were made out on that basis. But for the present rate at which business can be done in that way, see a paragraph in our paper of June 30th, p. 442, second column, about the Moss Bay Iron Co., Brew, 680 standards, exceeding 2 000 loads—in two days!
