TREES IN IRELAND.—In view of a proposal to extend the planting of trees in Ireland as a means of improving the condition of the country, a Parliamentary return moved for by Mr. Marum of the number of timber trees registered in the sister isle has been issued. It is furnished by the clerks of the peace of the several counties, and it shows the total number of trees registered to be 5,958,973. The best wooded county would appear to be Cork, with 1,300,963, and the most sparsely timbered county Proper, as distinguished from cities, is Louth, with 7,799 registered trees.

Mr. Ward (Messrs.

SIMPSON & BODDY.—This case was brought before the Court last week. The debtors, trading as timber merchants, &c., at the Union Saw-mills, Burne Street, Marylebone, and St. Peter's Wharf, Amberley Road, under the firm of Simpson & Co., have petitioned for the liquidation of their affairs, and Mr. F. C. Willis applied for the appointment of Mr. Francis Cooper, accountant, 14, George Street, Mansion House, as receiver and manager under the proceedings. The liabilities amounted to about £50,000, and it appeared from the affidavit of Mr. Simpson that the assets comprised a large amount of stock at the Union Saw - mills and St. Peter's Wharf. The business was an extensive one, and a number of workpeople were employed, whose wages would have to be paid. There were also numerous orders on hand, and it was necessary that the same should be executed. The application was supported by Mr. Edgar S. Simpson, a creditor for £3,400. Mr. Registrar Pepys made the desired appointment. Messrs. Browning, Castle, & Co., of Abchurch Lane, also appear as joint creditors for £1,129, and in the separate estate of Mr. Simpson the following creditors, secured and unsecured, have been scheduled :—

SAMUEL MORRIS.—A first meeting was held before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt, on Wednesday, under the bankruptcy of Samuel Morris, described as of 173, Isledon Road, Holloway, and 16, Union Court, Old Broad Street, late a builder and dealer in house and land property, and now out of business. The adjudication was made on June 14th, upon the petition of Mr. A. T. Ivens, solicitor, 18, Walbrook. The statutory accounts were not filed, but proofs of debt amounting to £1,421 14s. 7d. were admitted, and Mr. C. F. Richardson, accountant, 8, Laurence Pountney Lane, was appointed trustee with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. A. T. Ivens, of 18, Walbrook, and Mr. Alfred Tidy, 27, Sackville Street, Piccadilly. Solicitors, Messrs. Ivens & Nealy. Next meeting, November. 8th.

RADLEY.—The adjudication in this case was made in December, 1881, the bankrupt carrying on the business of a builder and the trustee (Mr. A. A. Broad) applied to the Court last week for an order closing the bankruptcy. The liabilities were £440, and the secured debts £3,460, and it appeared that there were no assets capable of being realised for the benefit of the creditors. Mr. Registrar Pepys made the order.

BABER.—The debtor, a builder and plumber, of 27, Kensington Park Road, had filed a petition for liquidation, and Mr. Rubinstein applied to the Court last week for a further injunction restraining actions until after the meeting to be held for confirmation of resolutions passed by the creditors for the acceptance of a composition of 1s. in the pound. Mr. Registrar Pepys granted the application.

GILLS.—The adjudication in this case was made in January, 1881, the bankrupt being then described as of Addle Hill, City, Linden Gardens, Bayswater, and Earl's Court, builder and licensed victualler, and he applied to the Court on Wednesday for his discharge. The liabilities were £5,501, and the secured debts £30,985, assets £3,884. The application was made in pursuance of a resolution of the creditors, whereby they certified that the bankruptcy and the failure of the bankrupt to pay a dividend of 10s. in the pound had arisen from circumstances for which he could not justly be held responsible. Mr. Registrar Pepys granted the discharge.

AND J. E. SHIRLEY. — We are requested by Mr. George H. Sprules, of 143, Cannon Street, City, to state that his debt in the first-named of these two cases is considerably less than printed, and is fully secured by a lease that he holds ; and that in the second case his debt is mostly covered by customers' bills.

INGRAM & RICKARD.—We are requested to state that the amount of £620 appearing in our last issue against the name of Mr. Charles B. Ingram in this case was incorrect; it should read £70 only.

There were twenty-eight failures registered in the building trades during last week, against twenty-four in the corresponding week of last year, or an increase of four. The total numbers for the same periods were 183, against 215, showing a net decrease of 32 last week, being a decrease of 214 to date this year.
