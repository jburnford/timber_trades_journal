Among the articles exported was a total of 2,170 tons of pit-props, distributed as follows:—Cardiff 110 tons; Newport, 275; Porthcawl 347; Swansea, 265.\n\nMAHENT TRESTLE, on the North Pacific Road, near Missoula, and high up in the mountains, is said to be the highest structure of the kind in the world. It is 866 ft. long and 266 ft. high, and contains 800,000 ft. of timber. Tract was recently laid across it, and a heavy construction train tested its strength to the satisfaction of the engineers.\n\nANOTHER TRIAL.—A man in Washington, who, it is stated, has failed in business exactly 85 times, has now started to retrieve the last break in his fortune by engaging extensively in the lumber business in Florida. He has rented a dock in New York, and although 65 years of age is said to be pushing his new venture with the energy of a young man.\n\nA WOODEN COSTUME.—A very unique costume was made for the Olympian Club carnival, Boston the entire outfit of dress, boots, mask, wig, and parasol being of wood. The chief garment was a princess dress made of various kinds of Spurr’s papered veneers. It had a broaded front and basque and trimmings of knife-plaiting, fichus and loops of wood ribbon, and was ornamented with rosettes and leaves in wood of various shades in their natural colours. At the sides there was a substitute for embroidery in inlaid work of fancy designs. The sleeves were of cork paper, trimmed to imitate puffing, and at the bottom was a deep border of black walnut knife-plaiting. The boots and gloves were of birch bark, and the mask of matched woods with a fringe of plaiting. The wig was composed of about 100 curls, consisting of white pine shavings artistically grouped. The parasol, of Chinese pattern, was covered with vari-coloured veneers, and similarly lined. This attempt was thoroughly successful, the effect of the different kinds and colours of wood in the combination being very striking and artistic. The veneers were so thin that the costume was not very heavy, and so flexible that it was not liable to injury.\n\nEPPS’S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.—“By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors’ bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.”—Civil Service Gazette.—Made simply with boiling water or milk. Sold only in Packets, labelled—“JAMES EPPS & CO., Homœopathic Chemists, London.”—Also makers of Epps’s Chocolate Essence.\n\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nHENRY JOHNSON.—A meeting of the creditors of Henry Johnson, of 93, Washington Road, Sheffield, builder and contractor, was held on the 10th inst., at the offices of Messrs. Binney, Sons, & Wilson. The receiver, Mr. Frederick Bedford, produced the statement of affairs, which showed liabilities £263 and assets £522. The creditors fully secured amounted to £1,476, estimated value of securities £1,950, leaving a surplus of £474, which was included in the £522, amount of assets. It was explained that the proceedings arose through the pressure of several creditors. The meeting agreed to liquidate by arrangement. Mr. Bedford was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection consisting of Messrs. Charles Partington, Thomas Hewson, and Henry Ralph. Messrs. Binney, Sons, & Wilson were entrusted with the registration of the resolutions.\n\nCHARLES PARTINGTON.—This case was noticed last week, and the following are scheduled as creditors, secured and unsecured:—\n... £ s. d.\nAssurance Company, King William St., E.C. 500 0 0\nBowyer W., Harrow Road, W. ... ... 72 10 0\nBurton J. & Co., George Street, E.C. ... ... 91 8 0\nButler J., Bloxham Green ... ... ... 28 14 0\nBaker A.
