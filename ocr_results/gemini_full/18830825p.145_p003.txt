FIUME.
Consul Faber's report for 1882 says the exports to Great Britain amounted to value 12,720,223 fl., showing an increase of 25,619 tons and 4,401,826 fl., as compared with the year 1881. The imports to Great Britain amount to 28,118 tons, value 1,776,208 fl., showing an increase of 13,827 tons and 1,668,499 fl., as compared with the previous year. The total increase was, therefore, 39,446 tons, or 69 per cent. in weight, and 6,070,325 fl., or 50 per cent. in value. There was an increase in 25 of the chief articles exported, including oak staves, timber, &c., and there was a decrease on boards and scantlings, square fir timber and other items. Trade was generally concentrating at this port, the chief increase being due to oak staves.
—The report just issued of Vice-Consul Behucke on the trade and commerce of Lubeck for 1882 says:—It is gratifying to state that trade has been rather satisfactory in 1882. An increase of our trade will principally be found in the receipts of our railways and in the greater number of vessels that arrived at the port. The export trade to the north of Europe had to compete with England and France, and even with direct imports from America, whereas the import trade from the North is still interfered with by the tariff of 1879 and the abnormally low railway freight which formerly existed in favour of a direct trade from Lubeck to the west of Germany. The timber trade, he says, has most increased, the railway receipts and the shipping of the port, for the import of timber from the North was much more considerable than in 1881. The causes of a brisker trade in timber will be found in a better market at Hamburg, where many new houses are building, and in the cheapness of the article in the North. But the prospects for this branch are not at all brilliant. The tariff of 1879 generally diminishes the consumption of foreign timber in this country, and yet the duty on timber is still to be raised. The reason why a new tariff for this article is proposed is found in the small net proceeds of the German forests. The timber merchants of this place, however, are of opinion that the low prices of German timber must be principally be attributed to the bad condition of the saw-mills, the want of intelligence with regard to the timber trade, and to the want of capital; for the trade is not carried on by large firms, and most timber is prepared for sale by labourers who work according to a system that has been long out of use elsewhere. The total import of timber in 1881 was 455,000 dozen planks and deals, 106,000 pieces beams and spars, 12,700 dozen of laths, and in 1882, 572,000 dozen planks and deals, 216,000 pieces beams and spars, 11,300 dozen laths.
