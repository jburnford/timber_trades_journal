Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather. Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, clings well to the pulleys, runs true, and can be made any length without joints.\nThis Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley and Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.\nOver 500,000 Feet\nSOLD DURING 1882,\nincluding 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, of widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are now driving over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe and America.\nPRIZES.â€”HAMBURGH, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; NEW YORK, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PERTH, [?]; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.\nThe following Tests (made by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.\nBest Double Leather 6in. Belting ... Breaking Strain per Square in. of Section. 3,872 lbs. ... Price per foot. 5s. 7d.\nGandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton ... 6,811 lbs. ... 2s. 6d.\nTHE \"GANDY\" BELT.\nGANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular. Its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, and given above, to which special attention is directed. These \"Gandy\" Belts are made of any width up to 150 inches without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system of driving which is always causing a stoppage. It is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always slipping. Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared by machinery and process to prevent its stretching, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery, which renders them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts is only a question of time.\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nMAURICE GANDY, PATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER, 130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON, E.C.
