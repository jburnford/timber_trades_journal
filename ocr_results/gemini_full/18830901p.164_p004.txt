The case came before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt on Tuesday. Upon the application of Mr. R. Parker, his Honour appointed Mr. T. W. Nicholls, of 208, Gray's Inn Road, receiver of the estate, and granted the usual injunction. The assets were estimated at about £365. The first meeting is fixed for the 14th inst., at twelve o'clock, at the Guildhall Tavern.

MERRITT & ASHBY.—The debtors, described as of London Wall, and the Crown Works, Hoxton, builders and contractors, had filed a petition for liquidation, and Mr. S. Woolf applied last week for registration of the resolutions come to at the adjourned meeting of creditors. Liabilities £12,187, and debts fully secured £8,713 ; assets £4,430. A composition of 2s. 6d. in the pound was accepted, payable within one month from the date of registration. Mr. F. C. Willis opposed on behalf of Messrs. Quick & Bidder, solicitors, who claimed to be creditors for about £1,800, but their proof was disputed. It appeared that the debtors had in July, 1882, entered into a contract for the erection of the Pandora Theatre, in Leicester Square, for the sum of £23,000. The contract was introduced to them by Messrs. Quick & Bidder. Those gentlemen acted as solicitors for them, and were also concerned professionally for Lord Donoughmore. The sum of £12,000 was to be paid in cash and the balance by bills; shares in the Pandora Company were also deposited as collateral security. Not more than £5,000 or £6,000 was paid in cash, and, the debtors being in want of funds for the purposes of the contract, applied to Messrs. Quick & Bidder for assistance. It happened that those gentlemen held two acceptances of Lord Donoughmore's, amounting to £2,000, which had been deposited with them in relation to a railway Bill in which his lordship was interested. They allowed the debtors to have the use of those acceptances upon the arrangement that they would make them good out of the moneys to be received from the Pandora contract. The Pandora Company had since failed, and ultimately Messrs. Quick & Bidder had to pay the £2,000. They had recovered only £200 of the amount from the debtors, and sued them for the balance. Messrs. Merritt & Ashby, however, denied their liability, and were defending the action upon the ground that Lord Donoughmore's acceptances had really been received by them on account of the Pandora contract, and not by way of loan. Messrs. Quick & Bidder and Mr. Ashby were examined, and the latter stated in his evidence that Lord Donoughmore was one of the directors of the Pandora Company. He believed he had heard that his lordship was practically the Pandora Company. At the adjourned sitting on Wednesday Mr. Registrar Hazlitt came to the conclusion that the proof of Messrs. Quick & Bidder must be disallowed. He was of opinion, having regard to the nature of the assets and to the rights of certain elegit creditors, that the composition of 2s. 6d. in the pound was reasonable, within the meaning of section 170 of the new Act, and was calculated to benefit the general body of the creditors. He therefore registered the resolutions, but required the debtors to verify their accounts.
JONES.—The debtor, carrying on business as a contractor and brick merchant at Mile End Old Town, Hackney, and Stratford, had filed a petition for liquidation ; and Mr. Hatchett Jones applied on Wednesday for registration of the resolutions passed by the creditors. The liabilities amounted to £17,277, fully secured £2,400 ; assets £1,281, consisting principally of stock and book debts. It was resolved that the estate should be liquidated by arrangement, and Mr. William Murdoch, accountant, 80, Cornhill, was appointed trustee, together with a committee of inspection, composed of Mr. Josiah Goodman, of Green Street, Bethnal Green; Mr. James Clarke, 121a, Globe Road, Mile End; Mr. Joseph Etridge, 492, Bethnal Green Road; Mr. William Tyser, of the Corn Exchange; Mr. M. J. Mumford, of Whitechapel; Mr. John Harker, and Mr. W. F. Marsh, Surrey; and Mr. W. F. Sweet, of Whitechapel. There was no opposition, and Mr. Registrar Hazlitt sanctioned the arrangement, under section 170 of the new Act, subject to the debtor verifying his accounts, and the trustee certifying that the resolutions were calculated to benefit the creditors.
S. CRISP.—A first meeting was held before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt on Wednesday under the bankruptcy of Samuel Crisp, of Commercial Road, Whitechapel, and Addington Road, Bow, builder and contractor. The bankrupt filed a liquidation on May 25th, but the proved abortive, and adjudication was made on August 11th upon the petition of the Tanners Hall Brick Company, Edmonton, for £128 12s. No accounts were filed, and in the absence of a quorum of creditors a trustee could not be appointed, the meeting being adjourned to the 11th inst.
SCOTLAND.—The Edinburgh Gazette of Tuesday last announces the bankruptcy of J. Kirkland & Son, wood merchants, Dundee. Creditors meet at Lamb's Temperance Hotel, Reform Street, Dundee, September 7th at 1 o'clock.
