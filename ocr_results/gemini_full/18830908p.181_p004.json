Thompson's, ship builders, Monkwearmouth, where a fitting yard for vessels is being made.\nPreparatory to the extending of the quay wall, the operation of driving piles is being carried on.\nThe pile frame and engine run along rails set on cross timbers supported by beams which have been driven into the sand and mud of the beach.\nAfter the frame and gear had been run on to the farther portion, the weight of the pile frame machinery caused the supporting beams to collapse, and threw the tall frame almost over, and causing the boiler to roll completely on to the beach.\nA man named Watts, who was sitting in a boat at the time underneath the frame, had a most miraculous escape of his life.\nThe boat was smashed to atoms, and Watts was removed to the Monkwearmouth dispensary, where it was found that he had sustained contusions to the spine and injury to the back.\nA workman named Elliott was also slightly injured, whilst another named Wallis had his hip hurt, and the engineman was also hurt in the back.\n\nHamburg, 1878.\nFirst Prize, Berlin, 1879\nPRIZES:—HAMBURG, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; NEW YORK, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1881; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.\nThe following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.\nBreaking Strain per Square in. of Section.

These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These \"Gandy\" Belts are made of any length up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system satisfactory, as it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always cutting at the joint. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton and then put-together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process which render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of the \"Gandy\" Belt is a question of time.\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nMAURICE GANDY, PATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER,\n130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON\nWORKS: LIVERPOOL AND BALTIMORE, U.S.A.\n\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nC.
