THE PROPOSED CANAL, CITY, AND DOCKS RAILWAY.—A public meeting was held in the Sir John Falstaff Inn, Old Street, on Tuesday.
On the motion of Mr. Bishop, it was resolved, "That in the opinion of this meeting it would be advisable to memorialise the above company to erect a station in Old Street, and also to urge them to proceed with the work as soon as possible."

ALARMING ACCIDENT.—A serious accident occurred last Thursday morning at the New Quay of Messrs. Thompson's, ship builders, Monkwearmouth, where a fitting yard for vessels is being made.
Preparatory to the extending of the quay wall, the operation of driving piles is being carried on.
The pile frame and engine run along rails set on cross timbers supported by beams which have been driven into the sand and mud of the beach.
After the frame and gear had been run on to the farther portion, the weight of the pile frame machinery caused the supporting beams to collapse, and threw the tall frame almost over, and causing the boiler to roll completely on to the beach.
A man named Watts, who was sitting in a boat at the time underneath the frame, had a most miraculous escape of his life.
The boat was smashed to atoms, and Watts was removed to the Monkwearmouth dispensary, where it was found that he had sustained contusions to the spine and injury to the back.
A workman named Elliott was also slightly injured, whilst another named Wallis had his hip hurt, and the engineman was also hurt in the back.

The following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.

Best Double Leather Belting ... 3,572 lbs. 5s. 7d.
Gandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton ... 6,811 lbs. 2s. 6d.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests. These Tests are given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made of any length up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system satisfactory, as it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always cutting at the joint. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton and then put-together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process which render them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of the "Gandy" Belt is a question of time.
A SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.

J. E. SHIRLEY.—The debtor, described as of Formby Road, Old Kent Road, and Richmond, formerly of 325, Cannon Street, timber merchant, had filed a petition for liquidation, and Mr. Maitland applied last week for registration of the resolutions come to by the creditors.
The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £1,130 8s. 6d., debts fully secured £1,796 12s., partly by securities being valued at £1,024 15s.
Preferential claims £12 10s., bills discounted £100.
Total amount £3,064 0s. 6d.
Assets, £1 024 15s. 10d., consisting of stock, book debts, furniture, and other property.
It was resolved that the estate should be liquidated by arrangement, and Mr. Ernest Foreman, of 57, Gracechurch Street, and Mr. W. O. Attree, of 52, Gracechurch Street, were appointed joint trustees, with a committee of inspection, composed of Mr. Charles Horne, 11, Leadenhall Street, Mr. Edward Stainton, 25, Abchurch Lane, and Mr. Alfred Youngman, of Grange Road, Bermondsey.
The discharge of the debtor was also granted, subject to a certificate from the trustees and committee that he had in their belief fully disclosed his estate.
Mr. Maitland said that there were at least 20s. in the £ worth of good general assets, and Mr. Registrar Hazlitt allowed the arrangement as being calculated to benefit the creditors within the meaning of section 125 of the new Act.
He declined, however, to give effect to the resolution in reference to the discharge, as he considered that ought to be held for the purpose of dealing with the discharge.
An adjourned first meeting was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt in the bankruptcy of Charles Cashford, of High Street, Walthamstow, builder.
The statutory accounts were not filed, but the following creditors proved against the estate: Wm. Cashford, £135; George Cashford, £28 11s. 11d.; W. G. Cashford, £102 19s. 11d.; H. G. Bruton, £53 13s. 7d.; John Hubble, £24; Wm. Hunt, £13 3s.; F. T. Prior, £299 10s. 1d.; Print, £34 11s.; J. W. Read, £70 1s.; Thomas Reader, Adlard, & Co., £17 2s. 6d.; and Roberta £147 12s.
The proceedings resulted in the appointment of Mr. L. W. Browne, accountant, of 4, Lower James Street, Golden Square, as trustee, with a committee of inspection consisting of Mr. G. Cashford, of Mare Street, Hackney, and Mr. F. T. Prior, of Sistova Road, Balham.
Next meeting, November 3rd.

The case came before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt last week, and it was stated that the funds for payment of the composition had been duly deposited.
His Honour thereupon registered the resolutions under section 126, the same being reasonable and for the benefit of creditors.

WM. SCHOFIELD.—This case has been already reported in the Timber Trades Journal.
The debtor, carrying on the business of a builder and contractor at Beckenham, had filed a petition for liquidation, and the case was brought before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt on Wednesday upon the adjourned hearing of an application to register the resolutions purported to have been passed by the creditors.
The liabilities were stated in the accounts at £24,131 17s. 4d., and the assets at £8,399 9s. 6d.

Lowes, 44, High Street, Camden Town; Mr. W. R. Lacey, of Golden Square, Clapham; Mr. Robert Hayward, of Old Kent Road; and Mr. Charles Cox, of Cambridge Park, Wanstead.

Mr. E. C. Willis, Q.C., and Mr. H. Kisch appeared in support of the application; Mr. F. C. Willis opposed on behalf of creditors.
The resolution in reference to the discharge of the debtor was withdrawn, and ultimately his Honour allowed the other resolutions to be registered.
