Price per foot 2s. 6d.\n\nTHE \"GANDY\" BELT.\nGANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown in the tests which are given above, to which special attention is directed. These \"Gandy\" Belts are made of any length up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, as it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. These improved Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially made for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process to prevent stretching and are impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts can only be a question of time.\n\nA SUBSTANTIAL GARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nPATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER,\n130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON\nWORKS: LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND, AND BALTIMORE, U.S.A\n\n[SEPTEMBER 15, 1883.]\n6 Albertine-Carlscrona-1,010 deals-J.
