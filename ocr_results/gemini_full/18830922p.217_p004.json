Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather. Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, climate, or steam. It runs true, and can be made any length without joints.\nThis Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley & Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.\nOver 500,000 Feet\nSOLD DURING 1882,\nincluding 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, in widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are now working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe and America.\nFirst Prize, Berlin, 1879\nPRIZES.—LONDON, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; NEW YORK, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1882; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.\nThe following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.\n| Breaking Strain per Square in. of Section. | Price per foot.\nBest Double Leather 6in. Belting ... | 3,572 lbs. | 5s. 7d.\nGandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton ... | 6,811 lbs. | 2s. 6d.\nTHE \"GANDY\" BELT.\nGANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; the strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests given above, to which special attention is directed. These \"Gandy\" Belts are made of a special American Cotton Duck, specially woven for the purpose, and are without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system which renders it impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one of the finest American Cotton Duck is used in the manufacture of Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the special Machinery and process of manufacture, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process which renders them impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts is only a question of time.\nA SUBSTANTIAL GARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nMAURICE GANDY, PATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER, WORKS: LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND.\n130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON, And BALTIMORE, USA.\n\nSEPTEMBER 22, 1883.\nLily-Riga-1,030 pcs. hewn fir, 3,534 deals, 60 spars, 16 pcs. hewn oak-Millar & Sons\n12 Thandvary-Fredrikahamm-14,342 battens-Alexander-McEwen\n17 Loch Ness (s)-Cronstadt-23,915 deals and battens, 1,860 pcs. lathwood, 62 lds. firewood-Millar & Sons\nSept. 10 Rein-Abo-9,792 battens, 11 lds. firewood-birch billets-C.

RANSOM.—The debtor, Samuel Ransom, of the Epoch Saw-mills and the Epoch Works, Kensal Road, timber merchant and contractor, has filed a petition for liquidation, and Mr. Ward (Messrs.

The liabilities were returned in the statement of affairs at £7,239 11s. 11d., and debts fully secured £7,020 18s. 4d.; assets £738 13s., after allowing for preferential payments. A composition of 2s. in the pound was accepted in discharge of the debts, payable in two instalments, at fourteen days and one month from the date of registration, and Mr. Foreman, of 57, Gracechurch Street, was appointed trustee. It was stated that the composition had been secured to the satisfaction of Mr. Foreman, and Mr. Registrar Hazlitt allowed the resolution to be registered, observing that if the matter went into bankruptcy the 2s. in the pound would probably disappear.\nTHOMAS BARR.—The debtor, carrying on the business of a builder at Highgate, had filed a petition for liquidation, and application was made on Tuesday for registration of the resolutions come to by the creditors. The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £1,258 6s. 3d., and debts fully secured £19,000; assets £5,505 16s. 1d., of which £5,005 16s. 1d. was the estimated surplus from property held as security. It was resolved that the estate should be liquidated by arrangement, and Mr. Edward Moore, accountant, 3, Crosby Square, was appointed trustee, together with a committee of inspection, composed of Mr. F. Stubbs, of Phœnix Wharf, Commercial Road, Lambeth; Mr. Alfred Geard, 72, Redcar Street, Highgate; and Mr. J. Jenkins, of 52, Camberwell Road. There was no opposition, and Mr. Registrar Hazlitt allowed the resolution to be registered.\nROBERT HUNT.—The debtor was described as of 16, Gloucester Road, South Kensington, Lott's Road, Chelsea, and of Chiswick, Hormton Street, Kensington, builder and house decorator. He had filed a petition for liquidation, and Mr. R. Furber applied on Wednesday for registration of the resolutions come to by the creditors. The liabilities were returned in the statement of affairs at £1,448 11s. 9d., and the secured debts at £5,050; assets, £1,312. A composition of 12s. 6d. in the pound was accepted in discharge of the debts, secured to the satisfaction of the trustee and committee of inspection, and the terms of the arrangement were to be embodied in a deed. Mr. B. Smart, accountant, 53, Cannon Street, was appointed trustee; the committee of inspection consisting of Mr. Henry Leatherdale, accountant, Old Jewry Chambers; Mr. A. E. Bird, of Shepherd's Bush, and Mr. A. Pfeil, of Broad Street, Bloomsbury. There was no opposition, and Mr. Registrar Hazlitt allowed the resolutions to be registered.\nJOHN KIRKLAND & SON.—Mr. Francis More, chartered accountant, of 24, St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh, has been elected trustee on the sequestered estates of John Kirkland & Son, wood merchants, Dundee, as a company, and John Kirkland, wood merchant, residing at Kilchrenan, near Dalmally, and David R. S. Kirkland, wood merchant, residing in Dundee, individual partners of the company. The examination of the bankrupts will take place in Dundee on the 27th inst., and the second meeting of creditors held at Lamb's Hotel, Reform Street, on the 8th October next.\nJAY & DIMSDALE.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Thursday. The debtors were described as contractors, lately carrying on business at Pembroke Wharf, and Commercial Road; Avenell Road, Highbury; and presented a petition for liquidation. They have S. Ward applied for the appointment, and Mr. E. Foreman, accountant, 57, Gracechurch Street, as receiver of the estate; also for an injunction restraining proceedings by creditors. The debts amounted to about £7,000, and the assets were stated to consist of leasehold property in Avenell Road, Highbury, and book debts, of the value of about £4,500, of which £4,000 were held by secured creditors. The debtors were being sued by Messrs. Holland, McConnell & Co., of Wharf Road, City Road, for the recovery of £30; Messrs. Doulton & Co., of High Street, Lambeth, for £32 5s. 7d.; and Messrs. Street, Muggeridge, of Upper Ground Street, Blackfriars, for £36 2s. 6d. His Honour made the desired appointment and granted an [?]",
