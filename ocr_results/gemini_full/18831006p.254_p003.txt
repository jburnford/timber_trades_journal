A SURGICAL CABINETMAKER.—A Mrs. Graves, of Buck County, Pa., says the Philadelphia Ledger, has a cow which about four months ago had its right front leg cut off below the knee by a railroad train. A veterinary surgeon dressed the wound and tied up the arteries so skilfully that the cow recovered. She was kept in the stable until a few days ago, when a neighbour, a cabinetmaker, made for her a wooden leg, which was strapped on the stump. The cow hopped along holding the injured leg up for a day or two, but now she has concluded to use the wooden attachment and limps around quite comfortably upon it and seems to be in good health.
TIMBER AND HEALTH.—How fatal are the results which attend careless indifference in this point, says the Builder, is singularly shown by what has followed in Italy on the disforesting of the once well-wooded peninsula. Not alone have the recent terrible inundations in the north of Italy been directly traced to this cause, but the fatal aria cattiva, the poisonous breath of the marsh lands, which has within twenty years or so invaded almost every province of the peninsula, now reigns supreme, driving from the once fertile plains thousands of the unhappy inhabitants. Here we see the direct influence of false economy in this one direction. When we consider, in addition, that Italy could, undoubtedly, by proper management, grow a large portion of the timber which at present she has to import, we see another direction in which a false economy has impoverished and impoverishes an already poor nation. England, without having reached this sad position, cannot be said to be beyond blame. There exists in our country many a broad stretch of land which, by the action of science, might be rendered productive, and at the same time beautiful. The growth of timber is not of a nature to tempt the speculative demands of modern private initiative; it is for this reason that it behoves the Government, or, at least, local authorities, to take up the question. They, at least, standing virtually independent of the consideration of immediate gain, are the only fit instruments by which such work can be done; but the system once set in order, the returns, it is evident, will be no less regular, even more so than from the ordinary sources of profit. A close study of the matter—an inquiry into the admirable methods adopted on the Continent, in France, in Belgium, and in Germany—would form an interesting subject of inquiry either for some Government commission, or for some privately appointed body. The question is one of something more than passing interest. Whence are we to obtain our supply of timber? Nature unaided will soon cease to be able to satisfy our demands; but we have here another of the many instances where science intelligently directed can solve the difficulty, and thus once again be of the utmost service to the world not alone practically, but aesthetically.

GANDY'S
PATENT COTTON BELTING.
Specially suited for and Patented in India and Abroad.
Hamburg, 1878.
First Prize, Berlin, 1879
THE GANDY BELT.
Any Length or Width for Main Driving.
It is the best belt ever made for all purposes.
Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather.
Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, clings well to the pulleys, runs true, and can be made any length without joints.
This Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley and Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.
Over 500,000 Feet
SOLD DURING 1882,
including 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, of widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe and America.
PRIZES.—HAMBURG, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURGH, 1882; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.
The following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.
| | Breaking Strain per Square In. of Section. | Price per foot.
Best Double Leather 6in. Belting | 3,572 lbs. | 5s. 7d.
Gandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton | 6,811 lbs. | 2s. 6d.
THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests taken by Kirkaldy, as given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made of any length up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system of driving which it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage. These stoppings are avoided by using Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared at Baltimore for the purpose, by a process to prevent stretching and to render them impervious to water and atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption is a question of time.
A SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.
