A SURGICAL CABINETMAKER.—A Mrs. G. of Buck County, Pa., says the Philadelphia *Lodger*, has a cow which about four months ago had its right front leg cut off below the knee by a railroad train. A veterinary surgeon dressed the wound and tied up the arteries so skilfully that the cow recovered. She was kept in the stable until a few days ago, when a neighbour, a cabinetmaker, made for her a wooden leg, which was strapped on the injured limb. The cow hopped along holding the injured leg up for a day or two, but now she has come to use the wooden attachment and can walk around quite comfortably upon it and seems to be in good health.

TIMBER AND HEALTH.—How fatal are the results which attend careless indifference on this point, says the *Builder*, is singularly shown by what has followed in Italy on the disforest­ing of the once well-wooded peninsula. Not alone have the recent terrible inundations in the north of Italy been directly traced to this cause, but the fatal *aria cattiva*, the poisonous breath of the marsh lands, which has within twenty years or so invaded almost every pro­vince of the peninsula, now reigns supreme, driving from the once fertile plains thousands of the unhappy inhabitants. Here we see the direct influence of false economy in this one direction. When we consider, in addition, that Italy could, undoubtedly, by proper man­agement, grow a large portion of the timber which at present she has to import, we see another direction in which a false economy has impoverished and impoverishes an already poor nation. England, without having reached this sad position, cannot be said to be beyond blame. There exists in our country many a broad stretch of land which, by the action of science, might be rendered productive, and at the same time beautiful. The growth of timber is not of a nature to tempt the speculative demands of modern private initiative; it is for this reason that it behoves the Government, or, at least, local authorities, to take up the question. They, at least, standing virtually independent of the consideration of immediate gain, are the only fit instruments by which such work can be done; but the system once set in order, the returns, it is evident, will be no less regular, even if more so than from the ordinary sources of profit. A close study of the matter—an inquiry into the admirable methods adopted on the Continent, in France, in Belgium, and in Germany—would form an interesting subject of inquiry for some Government commission, or for some privately appointed body. The question is one of something more than passing interest. Whence are we to obtain our supply of timber? The time unaided will soon cease to be able to satisfy our demands; but we have here one of the many instances where science intelligently directed can solve the difficulty. It would not alone be of the utmost service practically, but aesthetically.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

SAMUEL SABEY.—The debtor, described as of St. Peter's Street, Islington, and Green Lanes, builder, trading under the firm of S. Sabey & Son, formerly of Ironmonger Row, St. Luke's, has filed a petition for liquidation, and his affairs were brought before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Saturday. Mr. Lamb (Armstrong & Lamb) applied for the appointment of Mr. George Browning, accountant, 18, King Street, Cheapside, as receiver and manager under the proceedings. The debts amounted to £12,000, of which about £7,000 were secured, and the debtor deposed that his assets consisted of stock-in-trade, plant, machinery, trade fixtures, and considerable book debts, also of certain equi­ties of redemption. He had contracts on hand, including one for the erection of buildings in Ludgate Square for the sum of £4,060, and it was important that the contracts should be completed, as considerable profits were antici­pated therefrom. The application was sup­ported by creditors, including Messrs. Samuel Worssam & Co., for £71 18s. 9d.; John Benson & Rowlands, £200; Robert Ward & Sons, £1,200; W. H. Lindsay & Co., about £280; John Dale, £200; F. French, £97; and George Mills, £21 7s. 7d. His Honour made the desired appointment.

T. E. & H. JULIAN.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Saturday. The debtors, trading as builders in Marshall Street, St. George's Road, Southwark, under the style of T. Ennor Julian & Co., have presented a peti­tion for liquidation, and Mr. G. H. Barber applied for the appointment of Mr. John Langton, accountant, Cheapside, as receiver and manager of the estate, also for an injunction restraining various actions. The liabilities amounted to about £3,500, and the assets consisted of stock, building plant, furni­ture and fixtures, and book debts, of the total estimated value of £4,000. The debtors had nine contracts on hand, necessitating a weekly outlay of at least £400 for wages and materials, and no breach of any of the contracts had been made. They were being sued by the Staffordshire Joint Stock Bank (Limited), Walsall, for the recovery of £101 8s. 9d., by G. T. Arney, 59, St. George's Road, for £53 10s. 2d.; Billings & Howard, of Potter's Bar, for £68 8s. 6d.; D. Paull & Son, of St. George's Granaries, Southwark, for £35 15s. 2d.; Hudson & Carr, Millbank, for £68 1s.; Wells & Co. (Limited), Shoreditch, for £23 16s.; the Dorking Grey Limestone Co. (Limited), for £15 14s. 4d.; and by John Holden, of Northchapel, for £9 8s. The nomi­nation of Mr. Langton as receiver and manager was supported by Messrs. Robert Ward & Sons, creditors for £500; by Messrs. Scrutton & Campbell, for £250; Wm. Lee, Son, & Co., for £320; and by Mitchell & Harris, for £248. His Honour made the desired appointment, and granted an injunction, except as to the action at the suit of D. Paull & Son, in which execution had been levied before the petition. In addition to the creditors given above the following appear in the list:—

The first meeting is to be held at the Guild­hall Tavern, Gresham Street, on the 22nd inst. at two o'clock.

HENRY BAKER.—The debtor, described as of 12, Stoneleigh Street, Notting Hill, builder, filed his petition for liquidation on July 26th, but owing to the non-attendance of a quorum of creditors at the first meeting the proceedings fell through. Leave was, however, given to call a new meeting, and it was held on Sep­tember 26th, when the debtor furnished a state­ment of affairs setting forth unsecured debts to the amount of £1,517 8s. 6d., and debts fully secured £7,524 8s. 10d; assets, £161. Reso­lutions were passed for the acceptance of a composition of 3s. in the pound, payable in three equal instalments at six, eighteen, and thirty weeks respectively from the date of the second meeting, and secured by the joint and several promissory notes of the debtor, and of Mr. Robert Rowland, of Norland Road, Notting Hill. The case came before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Monday, and upon the appli­cation of Mr. W. A. Bilney, his Honour granted a further injunction restraining proceedings by creditors until after the second meeting, to be held on the 9th inst.

COLLINS THOMAS PRUDENTIAL.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Wednesday upon the hearing of an application to register the resolutions purporting to have been passed by the statu­tory majority of creditors in favour of liquida­tion of the estate by arrangement, with Mr. J. J. Kent, accountant, 55, Basinghall Street, as trustee, and a committee of inspection con­sisting of Messrs. William John Shepherd, Thomas Fitzmaurice, and Charles John Robin­son. Mr. Comyns supported the application, and Mr. Cole opposed on behalf of Mr. Isaac Wilkinson, late of Syden­ham, and now of Brighton, timber merchant, a creditor for £224; and it was also alleged that the debtor had omitted to set out in his petition certain addresses at which he had carried on business. His Honour, under the circumstances, declined to register the resolu­tions, but allowed a new meeting of creditors to be held, and gave the debtor leave to amend his petition by setting out the addresses which had been omitted.

MARK HULL.—The debtor, who was a builder and contractor in Shirland Road, St. Peter's Park, Paddington, filed his petition for liquida­tion so long since as July, 1882, returning his liabilities at £904 9s. 1d., and secured debts £6,197, with assets, consisting of surplus from securities, estimated at £753. At an adjourned meeting held last month a composition of 1s. in the pound was accepted, payable within seven days from the date of registration, and Mr. H. A. Dubois, accountant, Old Serjeants' Inn, was ap­pointed trustee. The case was submitted to Mr. Registrar Brougham for consideration on Wed.
