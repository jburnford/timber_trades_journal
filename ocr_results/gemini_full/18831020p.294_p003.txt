GANDY'S

It is the best belt ever made for all purposes.
Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather.
Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature.
It is true, and clings well to the pulleys.
Can be made any length without joints.
This Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley and Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.
OVER 500,000 FEET SOLD DURING 1882,
including 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, in widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in., and working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in England and America.

THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular. Its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by tests which are given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made up to 340 feet without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, as it is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always doing double duty. Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and rendered impervious to atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of the Gandy's Belting is a question of time.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
SIMPSON & BODDY.—The debtors, trading as timber merchants at the Union Saw-mills, Marylebone, and St. Peter's Wharf, Amberley Road, filed their petition in August last, and resolutions have since been passed and registered for the liquidation of the estate by arrangement, with Mr. Francis Cooper, of 14, George Street, Mansion House, and Mr. Ernest Foreman, of 57, Gracechurch Street, as joint trustees, together with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Joseph Payne (Peters, Rolt & Co.), Mr. Wm. Browning, Mr. T. F. Groves, Mr. Edgar Scott Simpson, and Mr. Richard Stevens. The discharge of the debtors was also granted. The liabilities expected to rank for dividend were returned in the accounts at £25,202 7s. 1d., and the assets at £11,488 11s. 1d. The case came before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Saturday, upon the hearing of an application by the trustees to disclaim their interest in premises occupied by the debtors, and his Honour made the order subject to the right of the landlord to prove for £375 for rent and dilapidations.
MARK HULL.—This case (previously reported) came before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Tuesday upon the adjourned hearing of an application to register the resolutions passed by the creditors for the acceptance of a composition of 1s. in the pound, payable within seven days from registration, Mr. H. A. Dubois, accountant, Old Serjeant's Inn, being appointed trustee. The debtor, who was a builder and contractor in Shirland Road, St. Peter's Park, Paddington, filed his petition for liquidation so long since as July, 1882, returning his liabilities at £904 9s. 1d., and secured debts £6,197, with assets, consisting of surplus from securities, estimated at £753. The Registrar, having regard to the smallness of the composition, had ordered the case to stand over for the production of further evidence, in explanation of the depreciation in the value of the property, and also directed notice to be given to the creditors. A further affidavit was accordingly produced, and no creditor appearing to oppose, his Honour allowed the resolutions to be registered.
R. JOHNSON.—A first meeting was held before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Wednesday, under the bankruptcy of Richard Johnson, of 86, Glenthorne Road, Hammersmith, builder and decorator. The bankrupt filed a petition for liquidation on September 3rd, estimating his liabilities at £2,900, but no resolution was come to by the creditors, and adjudication was made on September 28th upon the joint petition of Mr. A. Chapman, of 4, Fulham Palace Road, and Mr. H. J. May, of Coningham Mews, Hammersmith. The statutory accounts were not filed, but proofs of debt for about £300 were admitted, and Mr. J. R. Shearer, accountant, 10, Basinghall Street, was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. J. E. Taylor, of 127, Holborn, and Mr. S. J. Smith, of 93, Clifden Road, Clapton. Solicitor, Mr. J. Perry Godfrey. Next meeting November 16th.
ASCROFT, ROBINSON, & WILSON.—A petition for liquidation by arrangement has been filed in the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court by Messrs. Wills, Harper, & Cole, solicitors, Cable Street, on behalf of Messrs. Ascroft, Robinson, & Wilson, timber merchants, carrying on business at the Bankhall Saw-mills, Bankhall Street, Liverpool. The liabilities are estimated at about £32,000. No receiver has yet been appointed, and the assets have [?]
