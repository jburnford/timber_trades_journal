FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
SIMPSON & BODDY.—The debtors, trading as timber merchants at the Union Saw Mills, Marylebone, and St. Peter's Wharf, Amberley Road, filed their petition in August last, and resolutions have since been passed and registered for the liquidation of the estate by arrangement, with Mr. Francis Cooper, of 14, George Street, Mansion House, and Mr. E. Foreman, of 57, Gracechurch Street, as trustees, together with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Joseph Payne (of Bolt & Co.), Mr. Wm. Browning, Mr. T. R. Groves, Mr. Edgar Scott Simpson, and Mr. Richard Stevens. The discharge of the debtors was also granted. The liabilities expected to rank for dividend were returned in the accounts at £25,202 7s. 1d., and the assets at £11,488 11s. 1d. The case came before Registrar Brougham on Saturday, upon the hearing of an application by the trustees to disclaim their interest in premises occupied by the debtors, and his Honour made the order, subject to the right of the landlord to prove for £375 for rent and dilapidations.
MARK HULL.—This case (previously reported) came before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Tuesday upon the adjourned hearing of an application to register the resolutions passed by the creditors for the acceptance of a composition of 1s. in the pound, payable within seven days from registration, Mr. H. W. Dubois, accountant, Old Serjeant's Inn, being appointed trustee. The debtor, who was a builder and contractor in Shirland Road, St. Peter's Park, Paddington, filed his petition for liquidation so long since as July, 1882, returning his liabilities at £904 9s. 1d., and secured debts £6,197, with assets, consisting of surplus from securities, estimated at £753. The Registrar, having regard to the smallness of the composition, had ordered the case to stand over for the production of further evidence, in explanation of the depreciation in the value of the property, and also directed notice to be given to the creditors. A further affidavit was accordingly produced, and no creditor appearing to oppose, his Honour allowed the resolutions to be registered.
R. JOHNSON.—A first meeting was held before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Wednesday under the bankruptcy of Richard Johnson, of 86, Glenthorne Road, Hammersmith, builder and decorator. The bankrupt filed a petition for liquidation on September 3rd, estimating his liabilities at £2,900, but no resolution was come to by the creditors, and adjudication was made on September 28th upon the joint petition of Mr. A. Chapman, of Fulham Palace Road, and Mr. H. J. May, of Cunningham Mews, Hammersmith. The statutory accounts were not filed, but proofs of debt for about £300 were admitted, and Mr. E. Shearer, accountant, 10, Basinghall Street, was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. J. E. Taylor, of 127, Holborn, and Mr. J. J. Smith, of 98, Clifden Road, Clapton. Solicitor, Mr. J. Perry Godfrey. Next meeting November 16th.

Willis, Harper, & Cole, solicitors, Cable Street, on behalf of Messrs. Ascroft, Robinson, & Wilson, timber merchants, carrying on business at the Bankhall Saw-mills, Bankhall Street, Liverpool.

The case came before Mr. Registrar Murray on Wednesday, upon the hearing of an application for the appointment of Mr. H. W.

THE NEW SCANDINAVIAN COMMERCIAL BILLS ACT.
The Paris Bourse gives the following as the chief clauses in the new Commercial Bills Act, which applies to the three Scandinavian kingdoms:—
"The draft on Denmark, on Sweden, and on Norway, coming to maturity either on a Sunday or on a holiday are payable the next day, and not the day previous, as heretofore.
"The days of grace are abolished. The protest for non-payment must be taken up at latest the second day, providing it is not a holiday, after the expiration. The presentation for acceptance is not compulsory, except for a sight bill. If, in the latter case, no delay is stipulated on the bill itself, this delay is of six weeks for Europe and of one year for the drafts drawn on countries beyond the seas.
"The bills must be accepted at latest within four and twenty hours. In case of non-acceptance the holder is entitled to demand a guarantee for the payment of the amount and of the expenses on expiration. The protest for better security is likewise admitted.
"The bills payable at the 'beginning,' in the 'middle,' and at the 'end' of the month must be paid on the 1st, 15th, and last day of the month.
"The day of presentation or acceptance must be reckoned for the bills drawn at so many days' sight.
"The holder of a protested bill must notify the protest to its endorser within the two days following the non-series following the day of the protest: it is sufficient in that case to produce the receipt of the post office.
"In the case of return, there may be reckoned as total charge on the bill the commission for re-exchange, the commission, and the stamp.
"The delay of prescription for the acceptor of the amount of the bill itself is three years from the expiration. It is fixed at six months for the drawer and the endorser if the bill is payable in Europe, and at one year if it is drawn upon countries beyond the seas."
FIREWOOD CONTRACT.—The Guardians of the West Ham Union invite tenders by the 31st inst. for the supply of thirty fathoms of Christiania deals and batten ends for firewood.
