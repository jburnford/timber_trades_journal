GANDY'S PATENT COTTON BELTING
Specially suited for and Patented in India and Abroad.
THE GANDY BELT.
Any Length or Width for Main Driving.
It is the best belt ever made for all purposes. Much Cheaper and Stronger than Leather. Thoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, it clings well to the pulleys, runs true, and can be made any length without joints.
This Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley & Sons, Halifax, May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.
Over 500,000 Feet
SOLD DURING 1882,
including 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts, in widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe and America.
First Prize, Berlin, 1879

THE "GANDY" BELT.
GANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its cost being about half that of leather, while its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by the figures given above, to which special attention is directed. These "Gandy" Belts are made of any width up to 60in. without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley, a system of driving that is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always slipping. These Gandy's Patent Belts in one width. These Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, specially prepared for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery and process to prevent stretching and to render them impervious to heat, steam, or atmospheric influence. Possessed of advantages such as these, the universal adoption of Gandy's Belts is only a question of time.
A SUBSTANTIAL GARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.
