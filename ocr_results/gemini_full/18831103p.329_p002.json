Cooper\n\nGANDY'S PATENT COTTON BELTING.\nSpecially suited for and Patented in India and Abroad.\nTHE GANDY BELT.\nAny Length or Width for Main Driving.\nIt is the best belt ever made for all purposes.\nMuch Cheaper and Stronger than Leather.\nThoroughly Waterproof, and not affected by Temperature, it clings well to the pulleys, runs true, and can be made any length without joints.\nThis Series of Belting (see engraving) was supplied in one order to Messrs. John Crossley and Sons, Halifax, on May 1, 1880, and continues to give entire satisfaction.\nOver 500,000 Feet SOLD DURING 1882,\nincluding 5,100 feet of Main Driving Belts of widths ranging from 14 in. to 60 in. are working in over 6,000 Mills and Works in Europe and America.\nFirst Prize. Berlin, 1879.\nPRIZES.—HAMBURGH, 1878; BERLIN, 1879; SYDNEY, 1879; CINCINNATI, 1880; MELBOURNE, 1880; PITTSBURG, 1881; ATALANTA, 1881; PITTSBURG, 1882; NEW ZEALAND, 1882; FALMOUTH, 1882; TYNEMOUTH, 1882.\nThe following Tests (by Kirkaldy, of London) show the relative strength and value, compared with Leather.\nBest Double Leather 6in. Belting ... Breaking Strain per Square in. of Section. 3,572 lbs. ... Price per foot. 5s. 7d.\nGandy's 6 in. 8-ply Cotton ... 6,811 lbs. ... 2s. 6d.\nTHE \"GANDY\" BELT.\nGANDY'S Patent American Cotton Belting can claim a superiority over leather belts in every particular; its strength and gripping power is about double that of the best leather, as shown by repeated tests given above, to which special attention is directed.\nThese \"Gandy\" Belts are made of any width up to 60 inches without joint, thus obviating the necessity of having two belts on the same pulley.\nA system of driving with two belts is impossible to have belts of exactly the same tension; hence one or the other is always causing a stoppage.\nNow this is avoided by using Gandy's Patent Belts in one width.\nThese Gandy Belts are made of the finest American Cotton Duck, woven for the purpose, and then put together and finished by Gandy's patented special Machinery which renders them impervious to atmospheric influence.\nPossessed of advantages such as these, the universal and prompt adoption of Gandy's Belts becomes a question of time.\nA SUBSTANTIAL GUARANTEE GIVEN WITH EVERY MAIN DRIVING BELT.\nMAURICE GANDY, PATENTEE AND MANUFACTURER, 130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON, WORKS: LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND; AND BALTIMORE, U.S.A.",
