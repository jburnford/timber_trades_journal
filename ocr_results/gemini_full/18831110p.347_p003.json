All tenders to the Secretary, General Stores Committee, Midland Railway, Derby, to be sent in by the 14th inst.\nThe South Indian Railway Company invite tenders for general stores, including about 23,130 creosoted wooden sleepers. Tenders to the chairman of the company to be left with Mr. H. W. Notman, 55, Gracechurch Street, by the 13th inst.\nThe Cheshire Lines Committee are prepared to receive tenders for the supply of various stores during next year, including creosoted oak keys, &c. All particulars in advertising columns. Tenders by the 3rd December, to chief office, London Road Station, Manchester.\nDIVIDED STREET.—Wood paving is extending with great rapidity all over London, says a contemporary. The survival of a piece of stone paving at the bottom of St. James' Street is usefully at present to mark the divisions in London government. That street, like many others in London, is divided between two local authorities with different ideas of paving.\nA PROPOSED OTTAWA CANAL.—It is understood by a contemporary that the Ottawa Canal project has been revived by a syndicate of London merchants. A representative has gone to Ottawa to sound the Canadian Government on the subject. The route was surveyed by the Dominion authorities over thirty years ago, when it was proposed to utilize the French river to Lake Nipissing and out through a low ridge to the Montreal river. The navigable reaches of the Montreal river, now interrupted by rapids, are to be connected by a series of canals.\nAN OLD BRIDGE.—The remains of one of the oldest bridges in the world have been met with by engineers at Mayence—no other than the bridge erected by Charlemagne over the Rhine near the close of the eighth century. It rested on 28 buttresses, and was eventually struck by lightning and burnt down to the level of the water. The engineers have been busy taking away its remains, and have already removed over 500 piles of five to six yards in length. The timber is well preserved, though nearly 1,100 years old; so well, indeed, that it is still fit for building purposes, while the iron which was used to rivet the posts is also capable of being used, being covered by only a thin layer fo rust.",
