A Caution to Users of Belting.
Mr. Gandy begs to inform the Users of Belting that he is the Inventor, Patentee and Sole Manufacturer of the Belt now so well known as the “Gandy” Belt. His great success has caused unprincipled people to make and sell belting in imitation of his, and to issue price lists very closely imitating his, on which price lists are given figures, as representing the strength of the Belts they sell. These figures are not correct, and mislead buyers, as they represent one solitary piece of belting specially made for the purpose of that test, but the belting that is sold is not more than two-thirds that strength. Eight pieces of Belt purchased in different places, at different dates, all of which have been tested, and the Certificates of which can be seen, prove this. The public is therefore cautioned against this FRAUD. These unscrupulous people, by making such statements, and offering their imitation of “Gandy’s” Belts at a less price or greater discount to buyers, induce them to take these Belts as the genuine “Gandy” Belt, and in many instances they represent their goods as the genuine Belt, buyers believing they are buying Gandy’s goods.
In May, 1883, in an action in Chancery, Mr. Gandy was granted an injunction, with costs, against KERR & JUBB, OF HALIFAX, for selling large quantities of Spurious Belting, as and for the Belts of Gandy, where the Belting of Gandy had been ordered. Mr. Gandy has reason to believe that this is still being done, hence the necessity for this caution to Buyers. That Buyers may see for themselves that they must now stamps his Belts with his name every few feet, and Buyers will do well to see that the Belts they get are so stamped, and when ordering Belts from Merchants or Dealers to write on their order that they must have Gandy’s.
Users abroad when sending indents home for Belts will save themselves money and annoyance by stipulating to have none but the original and genuine “Gandy.” By not so stipulating it is known that some merchants send that on which they can get the largest amount of extra discount or commission, whilst the poor buyer abroad suffers by the transaction.

[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
GEORGE EDMONDS.—This case was brought before the Court last week. The debtor, described as of Park Road, West Ham, and Hollybush Street, Barking Road, builder and contractor, had filed a petition for liquidation ; and Mr. J. A. Wild, jun., applied for the appointment of Mr. W. L.

Rowton, Whiteway, & Co., of Greenwich, for the recovery of £50 9s. 10d. The debts, secured and unsecured, amounted to about £7,500, and the assets were valued at £2,115. Mr. Registrar Hazlitt made the appointment and granted an injunction.
