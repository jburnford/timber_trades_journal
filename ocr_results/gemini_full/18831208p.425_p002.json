Mr. Smith (Messrs. Miller, Smith & Bell) applied for the appointment of Mr. Henry Brown, accountant, Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, as receiver and manager of the estate; also for an injunction restraining further proceedings at the suit of Messrs. Trickett & Co., of Millwall, for the recovery of £101 5s., and by the executors of the late Mr. George Smith for a debt of £30,000, or thereabouts. The liabilities amounted to about £50,000, and the assets were valued at £30,000, comprising stock, plant, back debts, and other property. The debtors had large and valuable contracts on hand, especially a sub - contract with Messrs. Mowlem & Co. in relation to Government work, and unless the same were proceeded with, and the usual business of the saw-mills continued, great loss would result to the estate. There were a large number of workmen employed, whose wages would have to be provided for. The application was supported by the following creditors :—David Macdonald Smith, of Ashley House, Caterham Valley, £12,000; Francis Hoare, £3,000; and Samuel Smethurst, Co., Cavendish Square, £7,000. His Honour made the desired appointment, and granted an injunction until after the meeting of creditors, to be held at the Cannon Street Hotel on the 24th inst., at eleven o'clock.\nE. P. MARLEY.—The debtor, described as of the Slade House, Gravelly Hill, near Birmingham, lately trading as a timber merchant and packing-case manufacturer, at Phœnix Sawmills, Freeth Street, Birmingham, under the style of E. P. Marley & Co., has filed his petition for liquidation, with liabilities estimated at £13,000, and assets not yet ascertained. Upon the application of Messrs. Rowlands, Bagnall, & Co., of 71, Colmore Row, solicitors for the debtor, Mr. Registrar Parry appointed Mr. E. M. Sharp, of 120, Colmore Row, chartered accountant, receiver of the estate.\nDOBIE & Co.—A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Dobie & Co., shipbuilders, of Govan, Glasgow, was held last Monday. The liabilities were stated to be £92,000, and assets £41,000, leaving a deficiency of £51,000. A committee was appointed to investigate the affairs, with a view to obtaining an independent valuation of the assets.\nJ. E. FAWCETT.—A meeting of the creditors of John Edward Fawcett, stonemason and contractor, Derker Street, Oldham, was held last week. The statement of accounts showed unsecured creditors £1,902, and total assets £914. An offer of 2s. 6d. in the pound was accepted.\nE. W. PICKARD.—Last week Mr. Edward William Pickard, of the City Saw-mills, Gloucester, filed a petition for liquidation, with liabilities estimated at £12,000.\nS. MOSS.—The first meeting of the creditors of Samuel Moss, trading as S. Moss & Co., timber merchants, Gloucester, was held at the Bell Hotel on the 26th ult. The debtor was represented by Messrs. Taynton & Sons. Mr. Aitken, of the firm of Bland & Co., Cardiff, was voted to the chair. There was a large attendance of creditors, and the debtor's affairs were fully gone into. It appeared that his liabilities to unsecured creditors amounted to £8,511; to creditors partly secured £4,076, less £2,136, the estimated value of securities held by them. The debtor was further liable\n\nA Caution to Users of Belting.\nMr. GANDY begs to inform the Users of Belting that he is the Inventor, Patentee, and Sole Manufacturer of the BELT now so well known as the \"GANDY BELT.\"\nIn May, 1883, in an action of GANDY v. REDDAWAY and others, Mr. Gandy was granted a perpetual injunction, with costs, against KERR & JUBB, of HALIFAX, restraining them from passing off or attempting to pass off the goods of the defendants as the goods of Gandy. That buyers may see for themselves, Mr. Gandy now stamps his Belts with his name every few feet, and Buyers will do well to see that the Belts they get are so stamped, and, when ordering Belts from Merchants or Dealers, to write on their order that they must have GANDY'S.\nUsers abroad, upon sending indents home for Belts, will save themselves money and annoyance by stipulating to have none but the original and genuine GANDY. By not so stipulating it is known that some Merchants send out that on which they can get the largest amount of extra discount or commission, whilst the poor buyer abroad suffers by the transaction.\nMr. Gandy has been awarded Fourteen Prizes for his Belts.\nMAURICE GANDY, LONDON, LIVERPOOL, AND BALTIMORE.",
