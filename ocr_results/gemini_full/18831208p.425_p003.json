G. Hoare and Henry Mower, of 9, Commercial Road, Pimlico, sawing, veneer, and planing mill proprietors and merchants, trading under the firm of George Smith & Co., have filed a petition for liquidation, and their affairs were brought before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Friday. Mr. Smith (Messrs. Miller, Smith, & Bell) applied for the appointment of Mr. Henry Brown, accountant, Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, as receiver and manager of the estate; also for an injunction restraining further proceedings at the suit of Messrs. Trickett & Co., of Millwall, for the recovery of £101 5s., and by the executors of the late Mr. George Smith for £1,000 or thereabouts. The liabilities amounted to about £50,000, and the assets were valued at £30,000, comprising stock, plant, back debts, and other property. The debtors had large and valuable contracts on hand, especially a sub - contract with Messrs. Mowlem & Co. in relation to Government works and unless the same were proceeded with and the usual business of the saw-mills continued, great loss would result to the estate. There were a large number of workmen employed, whose wages would have to be provided for. The application was supported by the following creditors:—David Macdonald Smith, of Ashley House, Caterham Valley, £12,000; Francis Hoare, £3,000; and Samuel Scott & Co., Cavendish Square, £7,000. His Honour made the desired appointment, and granted an injunction until after the meeting of creditors, to be held at the Cannon Street Hotel on the 24th inst., at eleven o'clock.\n\nE. P. MARLEY.—The debtor, described as of the Slade House, Gravelly Hill, near Birmingham, lately trading as a timber merchant and packing-case manufacturer, at Phoenix Sawmills, Freeth Street, Birmingham, under the style of E. P. Marley & Co., has filed his petition for liquidation, with liabilities estimated at £13,000, and assets not yet ascertained. Upon the application of Messrs. Rowlands, Bagnall, & Co., of 71, Colmore Row, solicitors for the debtor, Mr. Registrar Parry appointed Mr. E. M. Sharp, of 120, Colmore Row, chartered accountant, receiver of the estate.\n\nDOBIE & Co.—A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Dobie & Co., shipbuilders, of Govan, Glasgow, was held last Monday. The liabilities were stated to be £92,000, and assets £41,000, leaving a deficiency of £51,000. A committee was appointed to investigate the affairs, with a view to obtaining an independent valuation of the assets.\n\non bills discounted which had not yet fallen due to the extent of £5,378. As against his liabilities he had stock-in-trade, plant, office furniture, &c., valued by the receiver at £676; book debts £3,014, estimated to be worth £750 only; and household furniture £143; thus showing a deficiency of about £9,000, apart from liabilities on the discounted bills above mentioned. The debtor accounted for this deficiency by saying it was caused by bad debts, great depreciation in the value of the securities held by his creditors, expenditure of large sums of money for the repair of machinery, &c. No offer of a composition was made, but it was proposed that the estate should be liquidated by arrangement. This resolution was put to the meeting, but it was negatived, the majority of the creditors expressing a desire that the estate should be wound up in bankruptcy. The proceedings consequently lapsed. The principal creditors instructed Messrs. Taynton & Sons to present a bankruptcy petition against the debtor. This they did on Tuesday, and the first meeting under the same is appointed to be held on Monday, the 17th inst.\n\nSAMUEL MORRIS.—An adjourned meeting for public examination was held in this case last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt, the bankrupt being described as of 173, Isledon Road, Holloway, and 16, Union Court, Old Broad Street, late a builder and dealer in house and land property, but now out of occupation. He furnished a statement of affairs, disclosing liabilities to the amount of £6,705 14s. 5d., and assets £14, the following being in the list of creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nAbbott T., Saltoun Road, Brixton ... ... 25 0 0\nAndrews C.

G. Gordon, of 53, Coleman Street, and the meeting for his public examination was held on Saturday before Mr. Registrar Murray. Unsecured debts, £1,117 5s.; secured £492; and preferential claims £14. Assets—surplus from securities—£346. There was no opposition, and the bankrupt was allowed to pass his examination.\n\nCHARLES BEACH.—The adjudication in this case was made in November, 1880, the bankrupt being then described as of Chertsey Road, Gunnersbury, builder and contractor, and he applied to the court on Saturday for his order of discharge in pursuance of a resolution passed by the creditors to the effect that his bankruptcy and failure to pay a dividend of 10s. in the pound had arisen from circumstances over which he had no control. The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £2,189 5s., and debts fully secured £1,200; assets £600 17s. There was no objection, and Mr. Registrar Murray granted the order of discharge.\n\nS. CRISP.—An adjourned meeting for public examination was held before Mr. Registrar Murray on Saturday, under the bankruptcy of Samuel Crisp, of 242, Commercial Road, and 30, Addington Road, Bow, builder and contractor. The statement of affairs showed debts to the amount of £2,211 13s. 10d., and property estimated at £1,115. No opposition was offered, and the bankrupt was allowed to pass his examination.\n\nCHAS. CASHFORD, builder, Walthamstow.—This case (previously reported) was again before the court on Saturday. Upon the application of Mr. Brough, on behalf of the trustee, Mr.\n\nRegistrar Murray confirmed an arrangement come to by the creditors for the acceptance of a composition of 1s. in the pound in satisfaction of the debts and the annulment of the bankruptcy.\n\nJOHN GALPIN.—A meeting of the creditors of Mr. John Galpin, of Abbey Wharf, Oxford, was held at Oxford, on Thursday, the 29th ult. The statement of affairs showed unsecured debts, £2,603 14s.; secured debts, £10,695 11s. 10d. In addition to these there were other liabilities, partly secured, including £301 17s. to Mr. Ald. Carr, who holds a policy of assurance on the life of the debtor; a sum of £438, £400 of which is alleged to be due to Mr. C. A. Galpin on partnership account; unsecured and partly secured debts, £399 16s. 11d. possible liabilities on discounted bills, £1,000. The total amount of secured debts, including liabilities on discounted bills, amounted to £3,595 8s. 10d. The assets available to meet these claims were put down by the debtor at the following figures:—Book debts, £566 and £12; stock-in-trade, £1,000; furniture, £25; interest in Abbey Wharf estate, £200; shares in companies £24; and three plots of freehold land at Grandpont, £100. The securities in the hands of fully secured creditors were estimated by the debtor himself at £12,800, thus leaving a balance of £2,104 8s. 2d. available for the unsecured creditors; total assets, £5,065 11s. 8d. The debtor was examined by several of the creditors, and defended him vigorously against a variety of charges. The securities in the hands of creditors, he maintained, were valued by himself on a basis below the usual custom, that there would be a surplus of £399 16s. 11d. on bills discounted by him. After considerable discussion, the debtor having withdrawn, a liquidation by arrangement was agreed upon in preference to proceedings in bankruptcy, and the following were appointed a committee of inspection, Mr. Walter Gray being trustee:—Mr. Charles Betteridge Walker (of the firm of Price & Co., Gloucester), Mr. Thomas Thorpe, Gloucester, and Mr. Frederick Bacon. The unsecured creditors included, among others, Messrs. Jones & Nash, Bristol, £373 17s. 1d.; Messrs. Boulcot & Co., Limehouse, London, £317 9s. 3d; Messrs Barkworth & Spaldin, Gloucester, £228 5s. 3d.; Messrs. T. & H. Green, Bedford, £140; the Welsh Slate Company, Portmadoc, £110. It was agreed that the meetings of the committee should be held alternately at Gloucester and Oxford.\n\nB.
