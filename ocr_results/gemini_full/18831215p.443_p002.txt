ELMWOOD BLOCKS.—Mr. Wm White, F.S.A., in a recent letter to the Builder, says, in reply to an inquiry made as to the use of elm for wood-block floors, “I introduced this material in the floor of the new church at Merifie'd, near Torpoint, fifteen years ago ; and the blocks have lasted and worn perfectly. But they were 2 in. thick, and were Burnettised before laying, which process does not seem to afford any certain protection from decay, though it seasons the wood by driving out the sap, and makes it less liable to the same amount of shrinkage. With elm, again, there is not the same danger of decay from a damp bed as there is with other wood. They should be laid nevertheless in a waterproof composition, so as not to cause the wood to swell in the laying and shrink in the drying. The floor above alluded to has been kept in a fine condition by rubbing with wax and turpentine, and is quite ornamental.”

EPPS'S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.—“By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.”—Civil Service Gazette.—Made simply with boiling water or milk. Sold only in Packets, labelled—“JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London.”
—Also makers of Epps's Chocolate Essence.

MR. C. H. WILSON AND THE HULL DOCK BOARD.
It is a great pity that Mr. C. H. Wilson, with his undoubted ability for business, should at times, in his eagerness to court popularity, make statements which upon investigation prove to be far wide of the mark. In his speech to the Liberal meeting a week ago he went out of his way to make the following remark, viz. :—The docks at Hull were narrow, and shallow in depth, because the Dock Board was composed of Conservatives, and, therefore, he argued that the whole Conservative party had no depth of thought. Mr. Wilson was once a member of the Dock Board—and a member during that time when the narrow docks, as he calls them, were being constructed. He knows full well, or at least he ought to know, that during that period, that is to say from 1870 to 1879, the board was composed of eight Liberals and six Conservatives, and that the chairman, Sir William Wright, was a Liberal of the Liberals. He ought also not to forget that he himself had a powerful voice with the Dock Board during those years, and that it was not only possible for him, but his bounden duty, to raise his voice at the Board, if the docks, in his opinion, were being wrongly constructed ; and he must remember that on his shoulders rests fully his share of the responsibility of the acts of the Dock Board during the time he was a member of it. Of one thing we are certain, and that is, that since Mr. Wilson left the Dock Board in 1879 the policy of the Dock Board has been far more liberal and far-seeing than during the period he was with them. Besides all this, such an argument as used by Mr. Wilson, if applied in other places, would cut two ways. There are very grave complaints among the ratepayers of Hull as to the manner in which the town's affairs are managed. They complain, and we think justly, of the dirty streets, of the ill-regulated traffic, of the condition of the police force, of the noisome stenches emitted by those horrible gratings in the middle of the streets, and many other matters ; but we suppose Mr. Wilson would indignantly repudiate the notion that all these nuisances were due to the fact that Hull returned two Liberal members to Parliament and a majority of Liberals to the Town Council! We trust that he will not forget that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and that it may be that the narrowness of the streets so cramps the ideas of Hull people that they return two Liberal members to Parliament.
Mr. Wilson's sneer at the narrowness of the Hull Docks can scarcely be called even a fair criticism upon the Dock Company, for it ought not to be forgotten, though I am afraid it often is, that the Town Council and the shipowners of Hull are responsible for the system instead of eastward. Years ago, after having built the Victoria Dock, the company's policy was to build a new dock to the eastward of it, but this was opposed by the shipowners and merchants, who said that they wanted a dock near the North-Eastern Railway lines to the westward. The Town Council of that day, as at present, ever ready to oppose the Dock Company, backed them up; an opposition was promoted, ending in a compromise by which the Dock Company abandoned their eastward policy, and in the land being purchased for the Albert and West Docks. If the Albert Dock is narrow, it is because the Humber bounds it on one side and the North-Eastern Railway lines on the other, a fact which cannot surely be laid to the charge of the Dock Company, for the site was chosen by the ship-owners and the Town Council ; and upon them the blame, if any must rest.—Hull and East Riding Critic, 8th December, 1883.

A FEW WONDERFUL TREES.—The “Kit Car-son tree” on the ranch of Henry Kellogg, near Las Animas, Col., is a cottonwood that has a circumference twenty feet five inches in its tree in Irwin County, Ga., has two distinct bodies, but only one top. The trunks grew out of the ground about five feet from each other, but at forty feet grew into each other, forming one tree, with one top. The walnut tree which served as a whipping-post where deserters and Tories were punished during the Revolution, still stands near Fishkill. The iron rings to which the culprits were tied while being whipped are hidden by the bark that has grown over them. A buttonwood tree during the Revolution still stands on the farm of George Sanger, Canterbury, Con. It is seventy feet high, the trunk measuring six-teen feet in circumference two feet from the ground, and is the same size around twenty-five feet above, where the branches first project.
