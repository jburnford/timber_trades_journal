THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
The act of bankruptcy was the departure of the bankrupt out of England in July last, with intent to defeat or delay his creditors, and it had been ascertained that he had gone to America. Owing to the absence of a quorum of creditors, a trustee could not be appointed, and the meeting was adjourned to the 28th instant.
