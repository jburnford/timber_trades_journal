F. PRENTICE.—A petition was filed last week by Thomas Francis Prentice, 30, Northcote Street, and Back Park Row, Jarrow, builder and contractor.\nLiabilities, £4,500; assets £4,250.\nMr. Thomas Gillespie has been appointed receiver.\nW. R. REEVE.—The debtor was a builder in Reighton Road, Clapton, formerly carrying on business at Stoke Newington.\nHe had filed a petition for liquidation, and Mr. R. Chapman applied last week for registration of the resolutions passed.\nThe liabilities were returned in the statement of affairs at £2,869 15s. 6d., and debts fully secured £5,419 15s. 1d.; assets £490.\nIt was resolved that the estate should be liquidated by arrangement, and Mr. Ernest Foreman, Secretary of the London Timber Trades' Association, of 57, Gracechurch Street, was appointed trustee, together with a committee of inspection consisting of Mr. J. Owen, 59, Vartrey Road, Stamford Hill; [Mr. S. Oxborough, of the Commercial Ironworks, Shoreditch; Mr. A. M. Biggs, 3, Pentonville Road; and Mr. C. L. Smith, of West Green, Tottenham.\nRegistration was ordered.\nJAMES BULLING.—A meeting of the creditors of James Bulling, contractor, &c., of Ollerton, Notts, was held last week at the offices of Mr. T. Bescoby, solicitor, Retford.\nThe debtor's statement of affairs showed liabilities £4,504 3s. 9d., and assets £1,315 16s. 6d.\nThe failure was attributed to the debtor having entered into large building contracts which had proved unremunerative.\nAfter a prolonged examination of the debtor, the creditors passed a resolution that the estate should be wound up in liquidation by arrangement, with Messrs. W. Hirst, of Newark, accountants, and W. Tomlinson, of Retford, builder, as joint trustees, and a committee of inspection.\nRICHARD JOHNSON.—The adjudication in this case was made on October 17th, the bankrupt carrying on the business of a builder and decorator in Glenthorne Road, Hammersmith; and application was made to the Court last week for the approval of an arrangement which had been agreed to by the creditors under section 28.\nThe liabilities were £1,140 6s. 11d.; and the secured debts £2,270; assets £112 10s. 6d.\nThe trustee (Mr. J. R. Shearer), was authorised to accept an offer of Mr. George Freeman, on behalf of the debtor, to purchase the estate for a sum sufficient to pay the creditors 3s. 6d. in the pound, together with all the costs; and the bankruptcy was to be annulled.\nThere was no objection, and Mr. Registrar Brougham made an order approving of the arrangement.\nDANBY & LOINS.—This case came before the Court on Saturday.\nThe debtors, trading as builders in Asylum Road Peckham, have filed a petition for liquidation; and application was made for the appointment of Mr. W. L. Harrison, accountant, Old Jewry, as receiver of the estate, also for an injunction restraining further proceedings in three actions.\nThe debts were returned at about £5,200, and the assets at £4,300.\nMr. Registrar Brougham made the appointment and granted an injunction until after the first meeting, to be held on January 7th, at three o'clock, at the offices of Mr. James Mote, solicitor, Walbrook.\nB. POWELL.—The first general meeting of the creditors of Benjamin Powell, builder and contractor, quarry owner, stone and lime merchant, of Laurel Mount Victoria-road, Heeley, and carrying on business at Grenoside and at Shireoaks, was held last week at the offices of Mr. Bedford, the receiver, read the statement of affairs, which showed total liabilities £9562 10s. 2d.\nMr. Bedford also read a statement showing how the debtor's failure had been brought about.\nTwo or three years ago he was worth £3,500, but he had suffered a loss of £1,500 from the purchase of the Grenoside quarry from his brother for his son, by the way in which the latter had carried it on.\nHe had likewise entailed a loss of £350 from a contract for the errection of three houses in Endcliffe Vale-road, £250 for depreciation of bricks, and £600 induced to purchase from the late Mr. Coupe.\nBut even with these losses, Mr. Powell would not have been placed in his present position had it not been for the relatives of his late brother pressing him for payment and refusing to give him time.\nIt was resolved to wind up the estate by liquidation.\nMr. Bedford and Mr. G. Franklin were appointed joint trustees, and the debtor's discharge was granted.",
