Messrs. CHALONER & Co.'s latest circular dated last Saturday, says:—There have not been any auction sales in the past fortnight. Stocks are light, and the prospects for mahogany of large to medium dimensions are good. St. Domingo: The supplies of the best veneer wood and logs of large diameters have been light in the past six months, and early imports will meet with ready sale. Well-grown curls 3 to 5 ft. long are wanted. Cuba: This market has been very sparingly supplied of late, and it presents a good opening for a well-selected cargo. Honduras: The stock consists of a cargo now landing, but another one is hourly expected to arrive. Panel and machine-making wood continues in good demand.

15
Mexican.—Tabasco: Mahogany of large to medium dimensions and straight is in request at full rates, but there has been an abundant supply of other descriptions in the past few months, and prices now rule low. The stock is chiefly of small sizes. Minatitlan: 402 tons, chiefly of small sizes, and imports of fresh wood would come to a good market and yield satisfactory results. Cedar.—The stock of Honduras is light, but prices rule low. Mexican has been in moderate request. Pencil cedar has not been inquired for. Walnut.—Italian: Logs have been dull of sale, and the old stock of burrs has been neglected, but a shipment of prime quality, quite fresh and well grown, would sell readily. American black walnut is abundant in stock and slow of sale. Circassian:—Consignments of the best quality, fresh, with thin sap, and of 6 to 18 in. diameter, from the cuttings of City St. Domingo, are wanted, and would realize full value, but other growths are in limited request.

TURBATO.—Wood for fuel has another rival in Mexico. An article called turbato, consisting chiefly of bog peat, of which there are immense quantities mixed with a proportion of bitumen, is extensively used for locomotives, stationary engines, smiths' fires, smelting and household purposes. It burns freely without much smoke, and gives a higher dynamic equivalent of heat than wood. The demand for fuel is increasing in Mexico, wood is growing scarce and advancing in value, and turbato, which is made and sold cheaper than either wood or coal, is advancing in popularity and general use.

THE NEW PATENT LAW.—The following is a short statement of the principal provisions of the new patent law as given by a daily contemporary:—An application under the new law may be made either with a provisional or a full specification; usually application with provisional specification will be preferable. The fees are reduced to £4. Provisional protection will now last nine months, in place of practically four months, as heretofore. By statute the patent is limited to one invention, and an examination will be made in the Patent Office to enforce this provision, and ensure that the invention is clearly defined. A full specification must be filed, either in the first instance, or within the term of provisional protection; this will be examined, and, if not in proper form, will have to be amended until it is satisfied. The invention will be published as soon as the complete specification is approved. The patent may then be opposed on either of the following grounds, but no other:—1. That the applicant has obtained the invention from the person opposing. 2. That the invention has been already patented. 3. That the examiner reports the invention to be similar to a prior application. Opposition will be adjudicated on in the Patent Office, subject to appeal to the law officers. The first bona fide applicant will always have the prior right to the patent. No action can be brought for infringement before publication of the specification. More scope is allowed for the amendment of defective specifications. An amendment cannot afterwards be disputed. The proceedings are changed, and the cases is reduced. The patent, if granted in fraud, may be revoked and reissued to the true inventor. Either party to a patent suit may require the court to be aided by a technical assessor. A patentee may be compelled by the Board of Trade to grant a licence—(a) if the patent is not being worked; (b) if the reasonable requirements of the public are not fulfilled; (c) if another person cannot work an invention of which he is possessed. These provisions apply only to patents granted after the 31st of December, 1883. Patents dated after the 31st of December, 1883, can be enforced against the Crown. The Treasury will settle what licence the inventor shall receive. The fees for renewing patents are :—Before the end of four years from date of patent, £50. Before end of seven years, or in case of patents granted after the 1st January, 1884, before the end of eight years from the date of patent, £100. Or, in lieu of the fees of £50 and £100, the following annual fees:—Before the expiration of the 4th, year, £10; 5th, £10; 6th, £10; 7th, £10; 8th, £15; 9th, £15; 10th, £15; 11th, £20; 12th, £20; 13th, £20. Any useful or ornamental new shape or design, whether for utility or registration, can be protected by registration. The term of protection will be made five years. The application to register may be made either with drawings or specimens. Before the sale of the registered article specimens must be supplied, marked. Under the new Act "fancy" or unusual words can be registered as trade marks.
