  "text": "JANUARY 12, 1884.] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\n\nSUNDERLAND.\nThe holidays have at last passed, and business will again run in its old groove.\nThe present mild weather enables outdoor work of all kinds to be pushed on, and in the building trade unusual activity is shown.\nImportations during the week are only poor, viz., a steamer from Fredrikshald with 600 loads props, for Rayner & Moller, and a cargo of oak timber, 250 loads, from Stettin for Short Bros. A Quebec cargo of 600 loads oak, elm, ash, white and red pine timber, and a quantity of deals, arrived during the new year holidays, and only commenced discharging on Tuesday last.\nThe cargo is for market, and as part of it is going into crafts for Hartlepool, we presume the Liverpool house, who have the matter in hand, are dividing the cargo.\n\nGRIMSBY.\nThere have been no arrivals of wood at this port during the past week, the movements being confined to one vessel, the Speculator, which sailed from here on the 3rd instant bound for Grangemouth.\nA movement of interest to the port of Grimsby and the Humber generally is the contemplated improvement of the River Trent, so far as its navigation is concerned.\nThis improvement is to be effected between the town of Gainsborough and Wilden Ferry, in the counties of Derby and Leicester, following the branch that runs by the town of Newark-upon-Trent.\nThe capital is to be £126,000, with power to raise additional capital to the extent of £100,000, and power to borrow further or mortgage to the extent of £25,000.\nOf the first sum, £26,000 is to cover the purchase of stock-rights, &c., from the old company.\nThis improvement of the Trent navigation has been a prominent subject for many years, and owing to the revival of inland water carriage generally, it is being taken up by a very influential body of gentlemen, and there is little fear of it becoming a reality.\nAbout midnight on Sunday a fire was discovered on the premises of Mr. John Bell, shipbuilder, near the Old Lock Hill.\nThe Dock Company's brigade were quickly on the spot with several lengths of hose, fire engine, and other appliances, and, with the help of the police and the volunteered help of the public, the conflagration was confined to the building where it originated.\nMr. Charles Simons, River Head, Grimsby, has been appointed carpenter and wheelwright to the Corporation for the ensuing year.\n\nLEITH.\nBusiness is now getting into proper trim, and operations in the building trade are again fairly under weigh.\nThe weather still continues exceptionally mild and open, the only cause for complaint being that building operations are rather scarce and few new contracts talked about.\nThe suspension of Messrs. J. Pentland & Son of this town is reported.\nThe liabilities are said to be large, and much sympathy is expressed for the firm, who were very much respected in the district.\nNo public sales have been held as yet this year, but Messrs. Ferguson, Davidson, & Co. have one announced for the beginning of February.\n\nGLASGOW.\nThere have been few arrivals of wood goods at Clyde ports during the past week—say altogether about 2,000 loads.\nBusiness has hardly yet resumed its ordinary flow since the New Year holidays.\nThere are no public sales to report at this time, but two are announced to take place here next week, results of which will be duly forwarded.\nThe wages question has been settled in a conciliatory spirit in the ship building yards in the upper reaches of the river, but at Dumbarton several hundred men are thrown idle, the labourers in a ship yard there having resisted the reduction of 10 per cent., the ironworks remaining also at a standstill.\nIn the steel trade also, the masters seem bent on adhering to the proposed reduction.\nQuestions affecting the prosperity of Clyde shipbuilding are, of course, of great interest to the timber trade here, which has in that industry its most important consuming power.\n\nSHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\nDISCHARGING LIST.\nLIST OF VESSELS DISCHARGING TIMBER IN THE SURREY COMMERCIAL DOCKS, JAN. 7TH, 1884, WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE STOWAGE.\nSHIP.

W. H. SMITH, late of Ringwood, says, \"I have used several pints of your Protected Alkaline Composition, for the purpose of removing old paint and dirty varnish from OAK, both plain and carved, and find it most admirable stuff for the purpose, as it leaves the oak a uniform warm brown colour without hurting the grain and stringle marks.\"\nSample and price, free from T.
