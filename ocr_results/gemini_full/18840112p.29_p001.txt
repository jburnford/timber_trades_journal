JANUARY 12, 1884.] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.

SUNDERLAND.
The holidays have at last passed, and business will again run in its old groove.
The present mild weather enables outdoor work of all kinds to be pushed on, and in the building trade unusual activity is shown.
Importations during the week are only poor, viz., a steamer from Fredrikshald with 600 loads props, for Rayner & Moller, and a cargo of oak timber, 250 loads, from Stettin for Short Bros. A Quebec cargo of 600 loads oak, elm, ash, white and red pine timber, and a quantity of deals, arrived during the new year holidays, and only commenced discharging on Tuesday last.
The cargo is for market, and as part of it is going into crafts for Hartlepool, we presume the Liverpool house, who have the matter in hand, are dividing the cargo.

GRIMSBY.
There have been no arrivals of wood at this port during the past week, the movements being confined to one vessel, the Speculator, which sailed from here on the 3rd instant bound for Grangemouth.
A movement of interest to the port of Grimsby and the Humber generally is the contemplated improvement of the River Trent, so far as its navigation is concerned.
This improvement is to be effected between the town of Gainsborough and Wilden Ferry, in the counties of Derby and Leicester, following the branch that runs by the town of Newark-upon-Trent.
The capital is to be £126,000, with power to raise additional capital to the extent of £100,000, and power to borrow further or mortgage to the extent of £25,000.
Of the first sum, £26,000 is to cover the purchase of stock-rights, &c., from the old company.
This improvement of the Trent navigation has been a prominent subject for many years, and owing to the revival of inland water carriage generally, it is being taken up by a very influential body of gentlemen, and there is little fear of it becoming a reality.
About midnight on Sunday a fire was discovered on the premises of Mr. John Bell, shipbuilder, near the Old Lock Hill.
The Dock Company's brigade were quickly on the spot with several lengths of hose, fire engine, and other appliances, and, with the help of the police and the volunteered help of the public, the conflagration was confined to the building where it originated.
Mr. Charles Simons, River Head, Grimsby, has been appointed carpenter and wheelwright to the Corporation for the ensuing year.

LEITH.
Business is now getting into proper trim, and operations in the building trade are again fairly under weigh.
The weather still continues exceptionally mild and open, the only cause for complaint being that building operations are rather scarce and few new contracts talked about.
The suspension of Messrs. J. Pentland & Son of this town is reported.
The liabilities are said to be large, and much sympathy is expressed for the firm, who were very much respected in the district.
No public sales have been held as yet this year, but Messrs. Ferguson, Davidson, & Co. have one announced for the beginning of February.

GLASGOW.
There have been few arrivals of wood goods at Clyde ports during the past week—say altogether about 2,000 loads.
Business has hardly yet resumed its ordinary flow since the New Year holidays.
There are no public sales to report at this time, but two are announced to take place here next week, results of which will be duly forwarded.
The wages question has been settled in a conciliatory spirit in the ship building yards in the upper reaches of the river, but at Dumbarton several hundred men are thrown idle, the labourers in a ship yard there having resisted the reduction of 10 per cent., the ironworks remaining also at a standstill.
In the steel trade also, the masters seem bent on adhering to the proposed reduction.
Questions affecting the prosperity of Clyde shipbuilding are, of course, of great interest to the timber trade here, which has in that industry its most important consuming power.

A WEEK'S CASUALTIES.—During the seven days ending at midnight on Wednesday, the second day of the new year, there were fifty-nine casualties reported at Lloyd's, but the loss of life was happily small—in one case the whole crew, in another all but one man, and in a third case five hands.
Only two vessels were with timber cargoes, and in neither instance was the accident serious.
The total number of British and foreign sailers and steamers thus reported during 1883 and up to the above date numbers 2,697.

NAVIGATION AND THE WEATHER.
HELSINGFORS.—(Jan. 9th.)—The harbour is completely blocked with ice.
STETTIN (Jan. 2nd).—It is notified from Swinemunde that the Misdrog (s), which left that place to-day for Stettin, has returned on account of ice.
For large steamers the navigation is not yet obstructed by ice.
DANZIG (Dec. 31st).—In consequence of frost, a rapid drift of ground ice has set in since yesterday along the whole course of the Vistula from Thorn to Danzig Head, and a considerable ice stoppage of the Polish Vistula is stated to have formed at Zawichhest.
PILLAU (Jan. 3rd).—The haff is frozen over with ice six centimetres thick.
The navigation to the inner harbours may be considered closed for sailing vessels and steamers.
CHRISTIANIA (Jan. 3rd).—During the last few days the water has become frozen over to beyond Steilene, but the fairway is still open for steamers.
The ice-breaking boats are constantly at work.
KONIGSBERG (Jan. 4th).—The navigation between Pillau and Konigsberg is closed for the present.

OAK—OLD OAK.
Major-Gen. W. H. SMITH, late of Ringwood, says, "I have used several pints of your Protected Alkaline Composition, for the purpose of removing old paint and dirty varnish from OAK, both plain and carved, and find it most admirable stuff for the purpose, as it leaves the oak a uniform warm brown colour without hurting the grain and stringle marks."
Sample and price, free from T. WILSON & Co., Stowmarket.—Advt.
