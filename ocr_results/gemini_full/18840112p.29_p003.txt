[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
E. CHANT.—A meeting of the creditors of Edward Chant, of 39, Grasmere Street, Liverpool, builder, was held last week. The statement produced showed liabilities £880 5s. 9d., and assets consisting of equities of doubtful value. A composition of 2s. 6d. in the pound, payable within a week from registration, was accepted.
J. F. EASBY.—A petition for liquidation was filed last week in the Bradford County Court, by John Faint Easby, lime merchant, &c., of Bradford. The debtor's liabilities are estimated at £100,000, nearly the whole of which it is stated arise out of land and building speculations, entered into jointly with other persons, some of whom have previously failed. Mr. James C. Wright, chartered accountant, has been appointed receiver and manager. This was the last petition filed at the Bradford Court under the old Bankruptcy Act.
J. CLARKSON.—A meeting of the creditors of Mr. John Clarkson, of Parkdale and Sedgley Park, Wolverhampton, and Codsall, brick manufacturer, was held at Birmingham last week. The statement of affairs showed liabilities of £11,977 to unsecured creditors, and of £41,364 to fully secured creditors, the estimated value of the securities being £42,417. There was a deficiency of £621 13s. 8d. in the value of securities held by creditors partly secured, and some small items from other liabilities brought up the total unsecured amount to £12,810 6s. 9d. The assets were £1,305. The failure was principally attributed to unsuccessful building speculation. An offer of 5s. in the pound, 3s. secured, was accepted.
