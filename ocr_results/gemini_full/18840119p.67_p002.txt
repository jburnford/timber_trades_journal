A Caution to Users of Belting.
Mr. GANDY begs to inform the Users of Belting that he is the Inventor, Patentee, and Sole Manufacturer of the BELT now so well known as the "GANDY BELT."
In May, 1883, in an action of GANDY v. REDDAWAY and others, Mr. Gandy was granted a perpetual injunction, with costs, against KERR & JUBB, of HALIFAX, restraining them from passing off or attempting to pass off the goods of the defendants as the goods of Gandy. That buyers may see for themselves, Mr. Gandy now stamps his Belts with his name every few feet, and Buyers will do well to see that the Belts they get are so stamped, and, when ordering Belts from Merchants or Dealers, to write on their order that they must have GANDY'S.
Users abroad, upon sending indents home for Belts, will save themselves money and annoyance by stipulating to have none but the original and genuine "GANDY." By not so stipulating it is known that some Merchants send that on which they can get the largest amount of extra discount or commission, whilst the poor buyer abroad suffers by the transaction.
Mr. Gandy has been awarded Fourteen Prizes for his Belts.
MAURICE GANDY, LONDON, LIVERPOOL, AND BALTIMORE.
