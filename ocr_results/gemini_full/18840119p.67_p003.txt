ERRATA.—We are asked to correct the amount entered against the name of Mr. R. R. Storey, of 53, Gracechurch Street, of £451, in the list of creditors re C. H. Puddy, (given at page 31 in our last issue), as the sum due to Mr. Storey is less than £5, the original figures being printed by mistake. Mr. J. J. Michael, of 191, Portobello Road, W., also desires us to entirely contradict the statement appearing in our last issue, at page 31, that he is a creditor for £75 in the case of T. N Wilcox.

A WEEK'S FAILURES.—There were only 13 failures in the building trade last week, against 28 in the corresponding week of last year, or 15 less. The whole number registered during the same period was 154 against 213, or a decrease of 59 last week, being a net decrease in 1884 to date of 21 failures.
