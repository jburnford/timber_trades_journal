This Act may be cited for all purposes as the \"Metropolis Safe Keeping of Firewood Act, 1886.\"\n2. This Act shall extend and apply to the Metropolis as defined by the Metropolis Management Act, 1855.\n3. In this Act the term \"Firewood\" means wood to be used in the lighting or maintenance of fires.\n4. The Board may from time to time make, alter, vary, amend, and repeal such bye laws as they may think expedient with respect to the following matters:—\n(1) The safe keeping in the Metropolis of firewood kept or stacked for the purpose of sale, and the nature and situation of the premises, in which, and the nature of the goods with which such firewood is to be placed.\n(2) To prevent the accumulation in a single stack, store, or heap, of such firewood of more than a prescribed number of cubic feet, and to determine the height to which such stack or store or heap may be carried, and the distance from each other at which they may be placed.\n(3) To prevent any stack, store, or heap of such firewood containing more than a prescribed number of cubic feet from being placed within less than a prescribed distance of any structure, building, or highway.\n(4) To limit the quantity of firewood to be placed above any space occupied, or intended to be occupied, by any person employed in the preparation or packing of firewood.\n(5) To prevent stacks, stores, or heaps of firewood being used for the purposes of a dwelling, an office, a counting-house, or stable, or any purpose of a like character, and to prescribe the distance from any such stack, store, or heap, at which a stove or fire may be placed.\n(6) To regulate the application for licenses under this Act, and to fix the amount of fees to be paid to the Board in respect of the granting of licenses, or of any other duties imposed upon them under this Act.\nThe Board may further provide by any bye law that in any case in which the Board think it expedient they may dispense with the observance of any bye law, made under the authority of this Act, subject to such terms and conditions (if any) as they may think proper, and such terms and conditions may be enforced in like manner in every respect as if the same had been enacted by such bye law.\nAll the provisions contained in sections 202 and 203 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, as to the making, publication, and evidence of bye laws, made by the Board, under the authority of the said Act and as to penalties for breach of the same, and the remission of such penalties shall extend and apply to the making, publication, and evidence of bye laws made by the Board under this Act, and to penalties for the breach of any such bye laws and to the remission of such penalties.\n5. The owner of any firewood kept or stacked for the purpose of sale, and of which the aggregate quantity upon the premises of the owner is not less than 2,000 cubic feet, shall apply under this Act for a license to the Board, and\n\nsuch firewood shall not, after the day fixed for the first granting of licenses under this act, be kept or stacked in the Metropolis, except in pursuance of a license given by the Board, and any owner of such firewood shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £20 a day for each day during which such firewood is so kept without a license. Provided always that the Board may grant such license subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may think fit.\n6. Any person authorized by the Board may enter upon or inspect any premises on which firewood is stacked or kept for the purpose of sale at all reasonable times, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there has been or is a breach of any bye law made under this Act, or whether the premises, if unlicensed, are such as are required to be licensed under this Act, and if any person refuses to admit any person so authorized, or to afford him all reasonable assistance in such inspection, then, in every case, the person so refusing shall incur for each offence a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds.\n7. Every penalty imposed by this Act upon any person may be recovered by summary proceedings before any justice in like manner, and subject to the like right of appeal, as if the same were a penalty recoverable under the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and shall be paid to the Board and applied by them towards the expenses of carrying this Act into execution; anything contained in an Act made and passed in the second and third years of the reign of Her present Majesty, Chapter 71, or in any other Act or Acts, to the contrary, notwithstanding. Provided always that in any proceedings against any person for more than one penalty in respect of one or more breaches of any provision of this Act, or of any bye law made in pursuance of this Act, it shall be lawful to include in one summons all such penalties, and the charge for such summons shall not exceed two shillings.\n8. The costs, charges, and expenses preliminary to and of and incidental to the preparing, applying for, obtaining, and passing of this Act, shall be paid by the Board.\n\n---\n\nNEW GOVERNMENT GUN VESSELS.—Sir William Armstrong & Co., of Newcastle-on-Tyne are about to build two fast composite gun vessels of a new type for the Admiralty. The vessels, which are to be delivered at Sheerness Dockyard in the course of next year, are to be named the Wasp and Rattler. They will have a displacement of 672 tons. Their engines will be of an exceptionally powerful type, it being intended to fit them with machinery of 1,000 horse power, the same power as the machinery of the Pylades and Satellite class of corvettes, which are more than twice their size. The Wasp and Rattler are to be armed with six 5 in. steel breech-loading guns and a strong equipment of Gardner and Nordenfeldt machine guns and spar torpedoes.\n\nJANUARY 2, 1886.]\nTIMBER MEASURING.\nCUSTOMS ANNUITY AND BENEVOLENT FUND.\nTIMBER MEASURING DEPARTMENT,\nCUSTOM HOUSE, LONDON, E.C.\nNovember, 1885.\nShippers, importers, and shipowners are informed that when the duties upon wood were abolished, arrangements were, at the request of the trade, made for the admeasurement of timber, &c., by the above Department at this port in the United Kingdom.
