The bankrupt attended at the Lewes Bankruptcy Court on Friday for his public examination. In reply to Mr. A. S. Cully, Deputy Official Receiver, he stated that his failure was attributable to losses on building speculations. He commenced business without any capital, but borrowed £50 from his brother. He had had some plant on some of his buildings, but it had been taken rapidly away by some of his creditors. He told them to take it, but did not arrange anything as regards payment. His brother had seized his furniture under a bill of sale, and he now had no means. Never kept any books. He smoked a bailiff out of his house a few weeks since with brimstone (laughter), but that had nothing to do with his failure. He was summoned, and fined £5, but his brother paid it. An adjournment was made to enable the debtor's affairs to be further investigated.\n\nJOSEPH ROBINSON, timber merchant, Leeds. —The first meeting of the creditors of the above debtor, carrying on business as a timber merchant in Leeds, was held on Monday, the 21st ult., at the offices of the Official Receiver. The liabilities and assets were reported, together with a list of creditors, in last week's issue. The debtor had previously been adjudicated bankrupt. Mr. John Gordon, jun., accountant, Leeds, was appointed trustee, with three creditors as a committee of inspection.\n\nW. H. CROSSLEY.—This failure has been previously reported. On Friday the adjourned meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Bond Street, Brighton. Mr. A. Mackintosh presided. At the former meeting a protracted discussion took place with regard to the affairs of the debtor, and eventually it was adjourned in order to allow the debtor to make an offer. Mr. W. A. Stuckey, who represented the debtor, now stated that he had gone into the debtor's affairs, and could only offer on his behalf a sum of £200 for the estate, to be paid in two equal instalments, the first at the expiration of one month, and the other in three months. While the liabilities were placed at £848, and creditors had proved for £500, while preferential claims were reported to be only £12. Mr. Stuckey stated that the necessary expenses would have to come out of the £200, which meant a dividend of 4s. in the pound instead of 5s. The creditors were unanimously of opinion that the latter should be offered, and impressed this upon Mr. Stuckey, who discussed the matter with one of the creditors, and said that he could not advise his client to go beyond £215, but thought that could be offered. Eventually the meeting agreed to accept this, and a resolution was passed, vesting the estate in a trustee and appointing a committee of inspection.\n\nW. POWDITCH.—This case was in the list last week, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Brougham, Assistant Receiver.
