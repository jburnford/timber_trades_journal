Messrs. CHURCHILL & SIM in their annual circular report as follows on the mahogany market:—The hopeful tone prevailing at the beginning of last year was unfortunately soon dispelled by the dull state of trade which became so general, and there being but little animation at the auctions, prices declined; small wood, being already so low, suffered least, but large logs, especially if at all defective, could only be disposed of at figures lower than have been known for many years past.
In the autumn, when the shortness of supply became evident, importers assumed a firm attitude, and as buyers did not at first respond, a good deal of wood offered at auction was withdrawn, but recently the position has been accepted, there has been brisk competition and a marked advance in prices.
The importation again shows a serious reduction, being only about two-thirds that of the previous year, viz., 22,284 logs against 33,066 logs, and as the consumption has only decreased thirteen per cent. stocks are reduced nearly forty-four per cent., and have not been so low for the past five years.
Only a light importation is expected this year, and therefore with the improved state of state everything points towards higher prices as the year advances.

THE TEAK MARKET.
Messrs. Denny, Mott, & Dickson, in their wood market report, say that deliveries last month from the docks in London were 1,900 loads as against 825 loads for the corresponding month of last year.
The following figures well deserve attention as showing the change for the better in the market which has been caused by the recent improvement in the shipbuilding industry :—
Deliveries from docks in London, 12,297 lds. for the year 1887, against 11,102 lds. for the year 1886.
Imports from docks in London, 8,381 lds. for the year 1887, against 18,653 for the year 1886.
Landed stocks in London, 10,781 lds. on December 31st, 1887, against 14,697 lds. on December 31st, 1886.

FORWARD SUPPLIES.
Tons.
Moulmein and Rangoon cargoes afloat on 31st December, 1887, about ... 8,000
as against 4,350 tons at the same date last year
Vessels chartered, but not yet sailed, on 31st December, 1887, not less than ... 6,500
Bangkok cargoes afloat on 31st December, 1887 ... 1,750
as against 1,550 tons last year
Bangkok ships chartered, but not yet sailed, on 31st December, 1887, not less than ... 8,500
---
24,750
equal to about 27,000 loads.

The reduction of over 10,000 loads in the imports of 1887, as compared with those of 1886, shows conclusively that the depressed prices, consequent upon the excessive shipments of 1884 to 1886, have effectually impressed shippers with the absolute necessity of having regard to the limited nature of the absorbing capacity of the teak market.
Although the imports show 55 per cent. reduction, the stock in hand shows only 27 per cent. reduction, and even in face of the improved tone and prospects the present stock of 10,781 loads is still a very heavy one for this market.
The forward supply already assured of 27,000 loads (as shown above) should serve to put the market here on its guard against the cry of short supplies and great scarcity, by which Burmese shippers are already seeking to establish a heavy rise in prices on the other side.
The present improvement in demand is almost solely due to the recent increase in shipbuilding orders, and cautious observers are quite aware that the sudden “spurt” in this industry may tend to reaction, and in any case does not justify over-stimulated prices or shipments.
A steady and equable recovery from the past depression is felt to be the real need of the market, rather than any excited and temporary inflation of demand.
Whilst deprecating any “rigging” tactics, it is nevertheless our opinion that prudent consumers should cover their likely requirements for the next few months, whilst holders of stocks on this side are in a position to supply them at prices which even now show an advantage to buyers for present delivery, as compared with those ruling for supplies to come forward.
