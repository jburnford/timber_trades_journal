E., saw-mill proprietor and timber merchant, Hounslow.—A receiving order has been made in the Brentford County Court against the estate of Albert Edward Addis, of the Inverness Joinery Works, Staines Road, Hounslow, Middlesex, and late of High Street, Hounslow, and also of 4, St. Stephen’s Villas, Hounslow, upon a petition presented by Messrs. Lambert, Petch, & Shakespear, solicitors, of 8, John Street, Bedford Row, London, agents of Mr. H. F. Galpin, of Oxford. No statement of affairs has as yet been filed, but the liabilities are estimated at about £1,300, of which £800 is expected to rank for dividend.\nBROADFIELD, W. P.—At the Guildhall, Worcester, last week, before Mr. Registrar Allen, William Perry Broadfield, of 12, Somerset Place, Worcester, timber valuer, attended for his public examination in bankruptcy. Mr. Woodward appeared for the debtor. In reply to the Official Receiver (Mr. C. M. Downes), the debtor said he returned his liabilities at £137 15s., and his assets at £11. The assets consisted of 150 ft. of oak timber. He had been without means for some months, and had served time in prison under a County Court commitment order. He did not think it wise to sell the timber. He did not know that a timber dealer had offered only 10s. for it; and he still considered it worth £11. He commenced business as a timber dealer in 1870, having at the time £50. He traded till 1874, and in February of the following year he failed, his debts being about £139. He had a small property at the time, but it was mortgaged. He believed that after the sale of the property there was a small surplus left for his creditors, but he did not know whether they were ever paid anything. After his failure in 1875, he continued business as a valuer and measurer of timber. A number of his liabilities were for timber which he had bought and sold again, but not paid for. He had no offer to make to his creditors. He was in lodgings. The Official Receiver said he should ask the Registrar not to let the debtor pass his public examination under the circumstances disclosed. In answer to Mr. Woodward, the debtor said he had bought and paid for £700 or £800 worth of timber during the last seven or eight years. This was in addition to the timber for which he now owed. The Registrar said the debtor simply wanted to make use of the Bankruptcy Act to be whitewashed of his debts. He should refuse to let him pass his public examination.\nCLIFT, ALFRED, builder, 46, Maude Grove, Brompton, S.W.—This debtor, who also describes himself as a private inquiry agent, has presented his petition, and on Monday a receiving order was granted by Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The debtor stated that he had furniture of the value of £50 or £60, but no plant or materials except a pair of steps or two and a few scaffolding poles. There were no other assets. The amount of the liabilities was not stated. An adjudication of bankruptcy was also made.\nDART, JOHN, builder, 13, Johnstone Terrace, Morice Town, Devonport.—The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held at the Official Receiver’s office, Plymouth, on Thursday, before Mr. J. Greenway, Official Receiver. Mr. J. Graves, solicitor for the debtor, explained that no statement of affairs had been filed, as his client did not know how he stood with Mr. Hutchings’, solicitor, by whom he was financed. It was mentioned that Mr. Hutchings claim was about £5,000. Mr. Legassick (a creditor) said in October last Mr. Hutchings gave him to understand that he was indebted to the debtor, and he declined to execute an order from Dart until Mr. Hutchings guaranteed payment. The bankrupt produced an account which he had prepared showing his transactions with Mr. Hutchings from 1881, when he first commenced business, and it appeared that he had received £10,000, whilst Mr. Hutchings had received either from him direct, or from purchasers of houses he had built, more than £11,000. He did not sell his houses at a loss, and the sole reason of his failure was the large amount of money owing to him by Mr. Hutchings. It was true that he owed to various tradesmen to the extent of possibly £500, but even allowing for that, if Mr. Hutchings had not failed, he, debtor, would have been £400 or £500 to the good. Mr. Legassick remarked that the merchants supplying goods to Mr. Dart and Mr. Hutchings received all the money for buildings. The bankrupt’s accounts had been kept by Mr. Hutchings. The bankrupt said he had never kept a book, but treated Mr. Hutchings as his banker, drawing from him when he required money, and he decided to appoint a trustee in order that the accounts might be thoroughly investigated, and Mr. F. W. Dawe, chartered accountant, of Plymouth, was appointed, with a committee of inspection.\nJAMES, ALBERT.—The first meeting of the creditors in this matter was held at the offices of the Official Receiver at Leeds on Thursday week. No resolutions were passed, and the estate will be wound up by the Official Receiver, therefore. The case has already been referred to in a previous issue.\nHENRY JAS., builder, Basingstoke. — The first meeting of the debtor was held at Basingstoke on Thursday before Mr. J. C. Moberley (Official Receiver). The liabilities amount to £2,754 4s. 3d., and net assets £1,865 10s. 1d., leaving a deficiency of £888 14s. 2d. The debtor was examined at some length, at the end of which Mr. John Follett, brick manufacturer, of Basingstoke, was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection consisting of Mr. G. Stephen, timber merchant, Basingstoke; Mr. W. W. Thorne, brick merchant, Basingstoke; Mr. E. J. Hunt, Reading; and Mr. M. C. Collier, Basingstoke; Mr. W. H. Milson, timber merchant, Basingstoke; Mr. W. Winchfield.\nGREY, THOMAS, builder, 12, Windsor Road, Penarth, Glamorganshire.—The following is a summary of the statement of affairs filed by this debtor under a receiving order made against him on the 12th December: Liabilities to creditors unsecured £651 4s. 6d.; to creditors fully secured £3,090, the value of the security being estimated at £4,000, thus leaving a surplus of £910 to be carried to contra, to other liabilities as per list D £18 15s., the whole of which is expected to rank against the estate for dividend. Assets, consisting of stock-in-trade cost £8, furniture cost £7, and other property cost £6, these together are estimated to produce £13, book debts, good £15 1s. 6d., and surplus from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors £910, making a total of £938 1s. 6d. and which, after deducting £44 3s. 5d. for preferential creditors payable in full, shows a surplus of £223 18s. 7d. to creditors:—\nThe following are the creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nRandall & Saunders, Bath ... ... ... 32 8 0\nPritchard W. & J., Penarth ... ... ... 116 9 10\nPenarth Slate Company, Penarth ... ... ... 58 2 6\nPrice D.

The total amount of the assets is £342 12s. 1d., preferential creditors’ claims amounting to £62 6s. 10d., and the deficiency appears to be £1,822 10s. 1d. The debtor appeared for his public examination at the Stourbridge County Court on Thursday week, and he was examined at some length as to his contracts and other work which he had in hand. It appeared from his examination that he has been in business on his own account for about seven years, his capital was £15, in addition to a guaranteed overdraft upon the",
