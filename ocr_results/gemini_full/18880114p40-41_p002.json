The liabilities were returned at £1,704 3s. 11d. and the assets at £601 16s. 8d. At the previous sitting the bankrupt was ordered to file a cash account with dates and items from January, 1885, to the date of the receiving order, but he had not complied with the order, and Mr. Aldridge, for the Official Receiver, submitted that the proper course under the circumstances was to adjourn the examination sine die. It appeared that upon the trustee, the bankrupt stated that he could not ascertain what kind of account was required. He had given up his books. His education had been neglected, and he did not know how to make out a cash account. Mr. Aldridge observed that the bankrupt was not inexperienced in insolvency, as he had previously failed in 1875 with liabilities amounting to £4,300. His Honour said he would give the bankrupt another opportunity of complying with the order of the Court, and for that purpose granted a further adjournment to February 15th.\nCOX, J. W., builder, Deptford.—The adjourned public examination of this bankrupt has just taken place before the Registrar at the Greenwich county court. The examination has been adjourned from time to time in order to enable the bankrupt to file a proper deficiency account, which order, however, has not been complied with. The bankrupt is a builder, and attributes his failure to on by him at Batavia Road, New Cross. It appears that he received altogether the sum of about £22,000, but was only able to account to the trustee for the expenditure of about £1,500. Upon the last occasion the Registrar informed the bankrupt that unless a more satisfactory account were furnished next time the examination would be adjourned sine die, and as the bankrupt again failed to comply with the order of the Court the public examination was adjourned accordingly.\nDAWES, P. H., builder and contractor, 17a, Great George Street, Westminster, and King's Lynn.—The receiving order in this case was made on Nov. 1st, and according to the accounts now filed by the debtor show gross liabilities £15,865 12s. 1d., expected to rank £7,227 9s. 1d., leaving a deficiency of £6,916 2s. 9d. The debtor states that he commenced business about fifteen years ago with a capital of £100, and he attributes his failure to losses on contracts at Norford (Norfolk), Oxford Street, Fulham, and Upper Holloway. The securities held by creditors comprise freehold and leasehold houses (chiefly the former) at King's Lynn, valued by the debtor at £7,000.\nDOUGLAS, W.—The Official Receiver in the London Bankruptcy Court on Thursday issued the summary of accounts filed by W. Douglas, builder, contractor, and house proprietor, who for thirty-years has been engaged in extensive building operations—chiefly at South Kensington. The gross liabilities are returned at £57,156 17s. 9d., of which £78,271 is expected to rank for dividend, and to be valued at £8,930, against assets valued at £8,930, to the conclusion of interest on mortgages, the cause of deficiency to be the large amount of interest on the properties. He alleges the cause of deficiency to be the large amount of interest on the properties, law costs, and the reduced value of houses. Debtor has omitted to keep such books of account as are usual and proper in his business, and no balance-sheet or statement of affairs have been produced, nor, it appears, has anything of the kind been made out during the last ten years. Reasons exist for believing that some creditors may think their security insufficient, in which event the claims against the estate may be considerably increased.\nDRAPER, JOSEPH, packing-case maker, of Battersea and Wandsworth Bridge Road.—The debtor has attended to pass his public examination before the Registrar at the Wandsworth Court. His statement of affairs has already been published in the Timber Trades Journal, with an official account of the preliminary proceedings. Mr. Mercer, the Official Receiver, of Victoria Street, Westminster, now examined the debtor on his trading and financial position. On his (the Official Receiver) application, Mr. Registrar Willoughby adjourned the examination, at the same time ordering the debtor to amend his accounts, and to obtain from Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co., of East India Avenue, certain statements, which the debtor alleges that they kept. A remarkable feature in the case is that the debtor began in business some years ago with a capital of only 4s., and succeeded in getting together a large trade but only some eight months ago he had a fire on his premises, by which he lost £3,000.\nFOWLER, WILLIAM, builder, Eastbourne.—At the Lewes County Court, on Tuesday, Mr. Money (Champion & Son), Eastbourne, applied for this bankrupt's order of discharge, observing that the failure had been brought about entirely through giving some accommodation bills. Mr. Mackintos (Official Receiver) pointed out that the bankrupt failed in 1888, when he took over an additional business, namely that of a firewood merchant, which had been carried on by his father. The assets had only realised £3. Some curious transactions were revealed in the case. After taking over the business debtor employed his father at 25s. per week but when the failure occurred the father claimed most of the assets. The debtor had kept no books, or even taken stock. His Honour suspended the discharge for twelve months.\nGULLY, E. S., cabinet-maker, Exeter.—The sitting for the public examination of this debtor was held on Friday at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court, when, in reply to Mr. Andrew (Official Receiver), debtor said Messrs. Thorndon & Co. had sold certain goods for him at sale. The goods realised £17, which was only the cost. He was perfectly satisfied with the transaction. He was in partnership with a Mr. Goff up to the end of 1883, when it was dissolved, and since then he had traded on his own account. A balance-sheet was prepared by an accountant at the end of 1883, which showed assets £9,569 6s. 8d., and liabilities same. During 1884 he made a profit of £100 as shown by the sheet, and that statement was true. His stock was taken according to cost price, omitting cost of carriage. His book debts at the time were £2,234 2s. 9d. He had a fire in 1886, when his stock was insured for £6,000. Mr. Andrew: But in December, 1884, your stock was stated at £7,235, why did you insure it under that value? Debtor: I was gradually reducing my stock. The Official Receiver: What was the value of your stock at invoice price at the time of the fire? Debtor: About £7,300. The Official Receiver: That shows an increase. Debtor: The fire was early in the year. I had my new spring stock; had it been later in the year the stock would not have been so much. I received £5,400 from the insurance offices, which I placed to the credit of the bank. He was indebted to the bank to that extent to save £109. He owed at the time of the fire about £4,000. He should say that his other debts were then about £1,500. The Official Receiver: Then there was at that time an ascertained loss of about £2,500. Why did you not call your creditors together? Debtor: I was not aware of it. The Official Receiver: I think it is proved beyond all question that the debtor was hopelessly insolvent at the time of the fire, and upon that something might turn in the question of discharge. Mr. Hutchens (who appeared for debtor): That question is not now being considered. After a very lengthy examination with reference to pledging a piano with Mr. Linscott, debtor was allowed to pass his public examination.\nHOAR, CHARLES, timber merchant, Leadenhall Street, E.C.—The receiving order in this case was made on November 25 on a debtor trading under the style of Charles Hoar & Co., and the statement of affairs which has now been filed shows total liabilities £15,887 11s. 1d., of which £26,310 8s. 2d. are fully secured, and £4,154 9s. 10d. expected to rank against assets estimated at £1,587 11s. 1d., leaving a deficiency of £2,566 10s. 5d. The debtor states that he has been in business many years, but commenced his present trading about ten years ago, being then worth about £16,000, represented principally by freehold and leasehold properties in which he had largely invested and in which he has had considerable transactions. He attributes his present debts and deficiency particularly to losses subsequent on his properties remaining unsold and depreciation in their values. He has not kept proper books of account. The unsecured debts include a liability of £1,842 18s., in respect of trust money retained by the debtor.",
