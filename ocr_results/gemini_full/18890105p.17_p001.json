John Pickles & Son, Royd Iron Works, Hebden Bridge, via Manchester, write as follows in answer to “A. B. C.” :—“We are the makers of a good tenoning machine, of which we shall be happy to send you an illustration. We consider the machine will entirely satisfy the your conditions; the spindles run in cone bearings, and not only the pulleys, but also the cutter heads are between the bearings and do not overhang, thus obtaining a rigidity necessary for good work.
