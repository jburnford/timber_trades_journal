QUESTIONS.
Wood Turning.—Can some of the readers of your paper furnish me with the prices paid for ordinary turning, such as chair and table legs, door, drawer, and cupboard knobs, cornice poles, wheel hubs, &c., and oblige ?—Yours, TURNER, S.M.

ANSWERS.
Tenoning Machine. — Messrs. John Pickles & Son, Royd Iron Works, Hebden Bridge, via Manchester, write as follows in answer to “A. B. C.” :—“We are the makers of a good tenoning machine, of which we shall be happy to send you an illustration. We consider the machine will entirely satisfy the your conditions; the spindles run in cone bearings, and not only the pulleys, but also the cutter heads are between the bearings and do not overhang, thus obtaining a rigidity necessary for good work. The machine is very strong, of good workmanship, and fitted with the usual accompaniments.”
