THE DUBLIN TIMBER TRADE AND PORT AND DOCKS BOARD CHARGES.
Mr. S. H. Bolton, proprietor of the Steam Works, Rathmines, near this city, in drawing attention of the above Board to certain of their regulations or bye-laws which, he submits, seriously affect himself and other local manufacturers, writes that at present, if any contractor or manufacturer import a cargo of timber, &c., he has to use the cranes which are fixed along the quay to discharge the cargo, for which the Board charge 10s., 15s., or 20s. per day according to the size of the crane. He says, "I am daily expecting a cargo of stone; your (the Board's) charge for the use of the crane will amount to about 10 per cent. on the value of the cargo. If I should get the stone worked at the quarry in England, and brought over by steamer, the stone would be landed, taken into your sheds, cared and watched over by your staff of police, and I would only have to pay freight. The same with a cargo of mahogany: the importer has to pay your crane charges, but, if the mahogany is worked up into furniture, it is landed and stored in your sheds, and watched over free of charge. In fact, your system is simply a bounty to foreign manufacturers, to the injury of home-made work, and, in addition to this grievance, there is a duty on timber which is not on manufactured work. I have no doubt this one-sided system of charges has helped to strangle the cabinet manufacture of this city, and as I have lately observed manufactured Portland stonework and woodwork being delivered from the steamers, a similar fate will probably overtake the trades of the Dublin stonecutters and joiners. I venture to ask that at least the home manufacturers be placed in as good a position as the importers of manufactured work, either by striking off the rent for the use of the cranes, or that rent be charged for the use of the stores which have been erected along the quays, and for which the steamship proprietors pay nothing, they at present having only to pay the river dues."
