WM. ALEXANDER & SONS, AYR).\nWE have the pleasure of presenting to our readers this week the portrait of a well-known and respected member of the timber trade of the west coast in the person of Mr. James Alexander, senior partner of the firm of Wm. Alexander & Sons, Ayr.\nThe business was originally instituted by Mr. Wm. Alexander, father of the present partners, fifty-four years ago, as joiners and builders, to which department it was exclusively confined until 1869, and during that time Mr. Alexander executed many large and extensive contracts in the west and south of Scotland, throughout which district he acquired a coveted reputation for his work in this sphere, and the great respect in which he was held for his integrity was evidenced in the frequent operations with which he was entrusted outside the circle of competition. Since this time, when he retired, he has ceased to take an active part in the business, his three sons who succeeded him having assumed all the responsibility of management.\nShortly after this date a new departure was taken in joining to their old business that of timber merchants and saw millers, the business capacity and indomitable energy of the younger partners finding greater scope in this additional department. The old premises and mills, which had hitherto been requisite for their own work as builders, were very soon found to be altogether inadequate for the trade which their aptitude and upright dealings speedily gained for them.\nIn 1878 they acquired the site on which the present mills are built, extending to about six acres, having a long water frontage and within a short distance of the docks, from which the logs are floated up the river direct from ships' side. The saw-mill is fully equipped with the most modern woodworking machinery, and is provided with every appliance and facility necessary for the economical and efficient working of the saw-mill trade.\nTheir imports into Ayr, which consist of American and every description of Baltic goods, are extensive, and are dispersed chiefly throughout Ayrshire and the south of Scotland, where their business connection seems annually to widen and increase.\nMr. James Alexander, the subject of our sketch, is much esteemed and respected as a citizen of Ayr, and he has devoted considerable interest to its public affairs. For six years he was an active member of the Town Council, and while there his practical counsel was always conspicuous in the advocacy of\n\nevery prudent scheme that had for its object the progress and welfare of the town. He was twelve years a member of the Harbour Trust, where his sound judgment and judicious advice on that important Board were advantageously felt.\nThe only other remaining partner is Mr. William Alexander, who devotes his time principally to the organisation of the various departments of the establishment, his practical experience, in the joiner business being greatly to the advantage of the firm and their customers.\nMr. Alexander is a man of great practical and business ability, and has wide personal experience which constitute him an authority on matters pertaining to the trade, and his high reputation has given the firm a prominent position in the commerce of Ayr. In him we have a worthy representative of the timber trade.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nDec. 27 Benahourd (s)—Drontheim — 32,016 deals and battens-Geo.

No doubt, if the weather before mid-week, if the weather is favourable, should see a beginning made, but it will be the middle of the month before much is done. Most of the merchants, it is said, intend asking increased prices, in view of the large advance demanded, and indeed obtained, by shippers for the new seasons shipments.\nAYR.\nThere is very little interesting to note regarding the timber trade; a fair amount of business has characterised the last few months. A great difficulty is, however, experienced in getting up the retail prices to\n\nJANUARY 5, 1889.\nFLEMING & BARRY,\nCAMPERDOWN SAW-MILLS, DUNDEE.\na scale commensurate with the cost of importing, and at present prices are much too low, when compared with advanced rates being paid for next season's goods. The present prospect is favourable, and the stocks are not too heavy.\n\nGLASGOW.\nThis being the New Year holiday week, when public works are closed, and business generally, to a large extent, suspended, there is little to report, beyond the stock-taking, which the summing up of shows the stock on hand at Clyde ports, Greenock included.
