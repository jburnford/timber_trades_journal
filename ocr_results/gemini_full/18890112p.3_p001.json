Prices have fallen considerably, and we hear of cargoes being stored on this side by shippers. Surely at this season of the year this is a great mistake.\n\nGLASGOW.\nThere is not much doing here yet, as business has not fairly resumed its ordinary flow since the New Year holidays, but after this time of general stocktaking by the trade, and with the definite information recently furnished as to the position of the market in respect of available supplies, it is to be expected that transactions will soon be actively going forward. A large proportion of the stock represented in the recent returns belongs to consumers, about half the square yellow pine being so held, and about one-third of the waney boardwood and the bulk of the oak. About half the pitch pine hewn and sawn is held by consumers and one-third of the teak timber. Of the lower grades of pine deals, most of the stock is in the hands of consumers, and of spruce deals only one shipment of Quebec and one of lower port are held by brokers.\nThe imports of the past year show a large increase over those of 1887, as indicated by the following figures, for the leading wood goods:—\nCarrying Tonnage.\nRegistered tons.\n1888. 1887.\nQuebec log timber and part deals, 33 sailers ... 36,612 ... 26,131\nQuebec and Michigan deals, 48 part steamer cargoes, 2 full \" ... 23,954 ... 18,139\nN.B. & N.S. deals and birch, 27 cargoes ... 16,978 ... 12,075\nPitch pine, 29 cargoes ... 31,023 ... 14,746\nTeak, 11 cargoes ... 7,881 ... 6,529\nMahogany, 10 cargoes ... 3,153 ... 2,558\n\nThat the consumption during 1888 has well kept pace with the increased imports is shown by the fact that the stock on hand now, as a whole, is only to a comparatively small extent in excess of that of a year ago, and from the healthy state of trade, particularly shipbuilding, an active consumption may be expected to continue. There is a good opening here at present for mahogany, cargoes of which usually begin to drop in about this time. The eagerness of the demand and satisfactory prices obtained at the last sale, held some weeks ago, afford strong encouragement for early imports.\nA cargo of sawn pitch pine timber for Messrs. Robinson, Dunn, & Co., is presently expected at Glasgow.\n\nLEITH.\nThere have been a good many arrivals during the past week—indeed, more than usual in the way of wood goods at this season of the year—but all, with one exception, are stragglers from last year. The exception is the Valun[?](s), from Drontheim, which is now discharging a cargo of battens and staves. The battens, which consist entirely of 2 in. whitewood, are a very nice parcel, and are for Messrs. A. Garland & Roger, who have thus the honour of the first fresh importation of the year.\nBusiness has been resumed this week, but scarcely to the full extent. As anticipated, merchants are asking increased prices for their goods, and as the necessity for doing so is apparent to those best informed, the advance is being paid with less unwillingness than might have been feared. Next week will see a commencement with the public sales, and if exposers maintain a firm position, buyers generally will be satisfied that prices will be maintained, and will arrange accordingly.\nSome chartering is reported to have been already done in this neighbourhood at stiff\n\nrates, but it is rather early yet to say how freights will rule. Importers who have contracted at the advanced f.o.b. prices should be chary about giving too high freights, and it would be more prudent to wait until nearer open water.\n\nIMPORTS.\nALLOA.\nJan. 1 Elizabeth-Laurvig-25,419 props-Love\n2 Hermod-Sandefjord-24,922 props-The Cowdenbeath Coal Co.\nLaura-Christiansand-22,268 props-Kirkwood\n3 Martha-Gothenburg-18,320 props-Love\n5 Kirstina-Christiania-7,476 props-Love\nWarberg-Halmstad-18,452 props-Love\nAYR.\nJan. 5 John Emanuel-Riga 324 pcs. hewn fir, 3,653 deals and battens-Paton & Sons\nParry-Riga 40 pcs. hewn oak, 5,457 deals and battens-Paton & Sons\nBANFF.\nJan. 2 Dolphin-Kragerroe-690 pcs. hewn fir, 190 battens, 8 spars, 7 lds. firewood-Paterson & Co.\nBORROWSTOUNNESS.\nJan. 1 Ida-Oscarshamn-5,741 props-Love\nLeif-Risoer-237 lds. props-J.
