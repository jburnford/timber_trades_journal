The amount sued for was in name of damages which pursuer averred he received on 6th October, 1887, while he was in defender's employment. He states that, while working a planing machine, it came against a knot in the wood, and his hand slipped into the machine, in consequence of it having not been properly protected. The defence was that the injuries received by pursuer were incidental to the nature of his employment, and that he was aware of all the risks he ran when he was engaged by defender. Sheriff Brown some time ago assoilzied the defender, but pursuer appealed to the Sheriff, who reversed the decision of the Sheriff-Substitute. The Sheriff said he thought the Sheriff-Substitute had come to a wrong decision in this case. He seemed to have decided the case on the principle of non volente fit injuria, and observed that pursuer, under his engagement, had been employed for nearly six months, and that he was working the ploughing machine without objection or remonstrance, thus interpreting the limit of his duty. He agreed with the Sheriff-substitute that pursuer was only a lad of twenty, that he was not a skilled mechanic, and that apparently he was engaged for was to attend to the furnace. Now, he was entitled to assume that his master had taken all reasonable precaution for the safety and proper fencing of the machine, which was not for the workman but for the master. Pursuer entered and continued the employment on the assumption that what the master had done was sufficient compliance with the obligations legally imposed upon him. This was not a proper case for the application of the doctrine of non volente fit injuria. The doctrine implied that a workman having equal knowledge of the subject with his master had elected to work an imperfectly guarded machine and took the risks upon himself, relieving the master from any obligation in the matter. He could not see that the doctrine had any application to the circumstances of the present case, and he thought that the only defence the master might have had would have been to prove that the boy himself was guilty of contributory negligence, but there was no proof of it. The only other point was whether it was the duty of the employer to have the machine fenced. He himself said that he had had accidents before at the same machine; other employers also; and it also appeared that there was a method known to the trade a method by which these accidents could be prevented\n\nROBINSON, DUNN & CO.,\nTIMBER IMPORTERS,\nPARTICK, GLASGOW.\nSawing, Planing, and Moulding Mills, Partick and Temple.\nTimber Preserving Works, Partick and Temple Siding, N.

He thought in the circumstances it was the duty of the master to have had this machine protected in the manner stated because one condition of the contract between a master and a workman was that while the workman undertook all risks incidental to the service, the master on his part would do nothing to increase needlessly those risks. He thought the action had been well brought, and that the pursuer was entitled to a verdict. He decerned in favour of pursuer for £50, with costs. Agent for pursuer—Mr. Robert D. Leslie. For defender—Mr. C. Buxton.\n\nANNUAL SUPPER OF EMPLOYES OF CALEDONIAN SAW-MILLS, GRANGEMOUTH.\nTHE second annual social meeting and supper of the employes of Messrs.
