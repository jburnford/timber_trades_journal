A. Garland & Roger's public sale on Tuesday, 15th inst., there was a large attendance of buyers, who all seemed interested to see how prices would go, this being the first sale of the new year.\nA beginning was made with the waney board pine, which was a balance, and was quickly cleared out at 2s. 3d. to 2s. 4d. per cubic foot.\nFor the wainscot and mahogany the bidding was not so brisk, but a good number of lots were placed at 4s. to 4s. 6d. for the former, and 7d. to 8d. per superficial foot for the latter.\nAfter clearing out some short Baltic redwood logs, an adjournment was made to the deal yard, where a large and varied assortment of deals and battens was offered.\nSome good prices were got for these goods, and a very considerable quantity was placed, although the exposers held stiffly whenever their limits were not got.\nThe sale continued until dusk, and, considering it was so early in the year, the result must be considered very satisfactory.\nThe following are some of the prices obtained for the deals and battens :—\nPer lin ft.\n11x3 red joisting deals 3d. to 3¼d.\n9x3 „ „ 2¼d. to 2½d.\n11x3 white 2nd Petersburg deals 3¼d. to 3½d.\n9x3 „ Riga „ 2½d. to 2¾d.\n8x3 „ „ „ 2d.\n6½x2½ „ Namsos battens 1¾d. to 1⅞d.\n6x2½ „ „ „ 1½d. to 1⅝d.\n6x2 „ „ „ ¾d. to 1d.\n4x2 „ „ „ ½d.\n\nD.
