The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.

only one cargo of deals and battens from Cronstadt, a straggler from last year.
Almost, if not altogether, the whole of those late cargoes are now in, and the arrivals will probably be very light for some time to come.
With fine open weather building operations are not interrupted, and there is a fair business doing from the yards.
At Messrs. A. Garland & Roger's public sale on Tuesday, 15th inst., there was a large attendance of buyers, who all seemed interested to see how prices would go, this being the first sale of the new year.
A beginning was made with the waney board pine, which was a balance, and was quickly cleared out at 2s. 3d. to 2s. 4d. per cubic foot.
For the wainscot and mahogany the bidding was not so brisk, but a good number of lots were placed at 4s. to 4s. 6d. for the former, and 7d. to 8d. per superficial foot for the latter.
After clearing out some short Baltic redwood logs, an adjournment was made to the deal yard, where a large and varied assortment of deals and battens was offered.
Some good prices were got for these goods, and a very considerable quantity was placed, although the exposers held stiffly whenever their limits were not got.
The sale continued until dusk, and, considering it was so early in the year, the result must be considered very satisfactory.
The following are some of the prices obtained for the deals and battens :—
Per lin ft.
11x3 red joisting deals 3d. to 3¼d.
9x3 „ „ 2¼d. to 2½d.
11x3 white 2nd Petersburg deals 3¼d. to 3½d.
9x3 „ Riga „ 2½d. to 2¾d.
