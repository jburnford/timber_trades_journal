THE SPURR COMPANY'S VENEERS.
These extremely useful veneers consist of natural woods backed with paper, and from the samples we have seen are likely to take the place of the solid wood to a very large extent. The woods are prepared in thin sheets and are backed with a preparation that renders them impervious to heat or damp. They can be placed directly upon plastered walls and ceilings, and by the use of wood mouldings laid out in panels, dado, friezes, centrepieces, &c., in simple or elaborate designs according to fancy. In addition to these are the new patent natural carvings, the veneer, after being properly prepared, being submitted to a very great pressure, and when finished give all the effect and richness of solid cabinet work and hand carving in fine and rare woods, such as mahogany, satinwood, walnut, birdseye maple, and other expensive kinds, at a marvellously cheap price, so that interior work, such as libraries, halls, and reception rooms, can be finished in walnut or other costly material equal in every respect to solid work at about a tenth of the cost. The agents for the patentees of this new invention are Messrs. Phillips, S. Justice, & Co., of 55 and 56, Chancery Lane, E.C., where samples of the veneers and carvings can be seen and inspected.

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. [JANUARY 26, 1889.
SEASON TICKETS FOR TRADERS.
An important concession to traders has just been made by some of the principal railway companies of the kingdom. For a great many years the companies granted to corn dealers, colliery proprietors, and cattle dealers special privileges for travelling over their lines. Season tickets were issued, available from point to point, for the purposes of trade only, and were not transferable. It was believed that by affording a trader cheap facilities for travelling he would be able to extend his business engagements and not only benefit himself, but increase the receipts of a particular railway company. But it has been found that an undue preference has been created. There are hundreds of traders whose business engagements with the railway companies are far more extensive than those of corn, coal, or cattle dealers. The railway companies have at length come to see the justice of the distinction, and a meeting of representatives of the various companies was held recently, when it was decided to issue the season tickets to traders of every description on the same terms as those paid or caused to be paid to the company by those whose lines they used a minimum of Â£300 a year for carriage; but no ticket, it was stipulated, would be issued for a less distance than thirty miles. The new scale of charges came in force on the 1st inst. on every railway system, but every trader must send in an application for a ticket. No tickets have yet been issued, but the applications are being verified, and in a few days the tickets will be posted to the traders.

ACCOMMODATION ON THE TYNE.
On Monday last a meeting, called by the Mayor in response to a requisition, was held at Newcastle to take into consideration the dock accommodation on the Tyne. The Mayor, Mr. Richardson, presided, and there was an influential attendance of coalowners, shipowners, manufacturers, and others.
Mr. W. D. Stephens, chairman of the North of England Steamship Owners' Association, said that a few months ago a deputation waited on the North-Eastern Railway Company and represented the inconvenience arising from want of depth of water in the Tyne Dock, which resulted in steamers frequently being detained in consequence. Recently the company informed them they were quite alive to the matter, but the engineering difficulties were so great that it would take some time to make fresh arrangements. The railway company was out of touch with the shipowners, and they ought to have a special shipping representative on the board of directors. It had long been understood that the railway company contemplated the erection of another high-level bridge above Newcastle, but the preferable plan would be to erect a high level at the docks down the river. This plan would not only equalise railway rates, but would bring into closer contact the coalfields of Northumberland and Durham, and open out a new and shorter through route for traffic generally, and relieve the congested traffic at Newcastle. Moreover, this plan would serve almost all the collieries on each side of the river, and as a matter of expense would be less than a new bridge at Redheugh.
A resolution was adopted calling upon the railway company to give immediate attention to the representations contained in the memorial from the shipowners, coalowners, manufacturers, and others recently presented to them, showing the inadequacy of the Tyne Dock to the requirements of commerce on the north side of the river. Another resolution expressed the opinion that the carriage and shipment of coal at the docks and shipping places on either side of the river Tyne should be undertaken by arrangement between the railway company and the River Commissioners as far as possible, an equalised rate of charge. A third resolution expressed the opinion that ships loading part of their cargo in the Tyne Dock and completing their loading in another dock in the river should not be called upon to make more than one payment of dock dues, and requested the railway company and River Commissioners to come to an arrangement by which this object should be secured.

NOVA SCOTIA LUMBER NEWS.
A correspondent from Bridgewater, N.S., writing to a contemporary, says:- The present season has been very favourable for this part of our province. There has been a larger manufacture in our water mills than ever known before, as seasonable rains brought down the stock and kept the rivers at a good sawing head all summer. Vessels have been scarce and freight rates very much higher than for the last few years, therefore shippers have not been able to move lumber freely. Stocks are larger than usual. There is now piled at Bridgewater about 8,000,000 ft., at Port Medway 4,000,000, and at Liverpool 2,000,000, which may have to remain over winter, or serve for winter shipment when the demand from the West Indies reaches here. The logs in the rivers will likely remain there till next spring. This will enable the mills to start, as the timber has to come from the heads of the streams and is late in reaching the mills. The saw-mill men is the subject now most engrossing the minds of the lumbermen of this province. By the late edict of our paternal government they are required "to keep all sawdust from the streams in Nova Scotia." To enforce this will curtail the business very much, as most of the mills are direct action (the saw gate connected with the wheel), and there will be waste in any attempt to stop the sawdust; and as most of our timber lands are nearly exhausted, there is not stock enough to warrant the large expense of removing the sawdust by machinery. We think there will be a general stoppage of the business until the matter is adjusted, as we cannot see the justice of removing the sawdust and New Brunswick lumbermen at the same time being allowed to grind up the greatest quantity into sawdust, and that also into the river. Until the edict is removed there will not be much preparation for next year's work, as it will not do to spoil in the log. In reference to the above statement that New Brunswick mills throw all their refuse into the river, the Miramichi Advance says it is right to say that, so far as the Miramichi mills are concerned, it is not true, as they scrupulously avoid doing so.

The directors of the London and St. Katharine Docks Company have recommended a dividend at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum, tax free, for the past half-year.

SERIOUS ACCIDENTS AT CRICH.-Last week several accidents occurred at Mr. Statham's saw-mills, Robin Hood. Mr. Warmby, who has lately left the mills, was walking on the premises, when he accidentally fell into a hot-water tank like a rib and fracture of his skull. The same day a youth named Statham, son of Mr. Statham, proprietor, narrowly escaped being killed by the trap by the horse of the mills. Mr. Henpy, one of his workmen, were also taking fright. Mr. Henpy's collar bone was broken, and he was removed to Derby Infirmary. Mr. Statham escaped with a severe shaking. Several accidents have lately occurred at the same mills.

TRADE NOTES.
Although a good steady trade continues to prevail, there is little very worthy of note to record in the events of the past week, orders in the consuming market are plentiful enough to prevent any sign of grumbling, but although retail prices keep firm, with an upward tendency, yet the advance that is warranted by the increased cost of forward shipments in respect of shippers' advance, and now in the high rate of freight evidently established is not, so far, realised.

The public sales of the week had satisfactory results as regards the volume of business done; the difficulty of obtaining any appreciable advance on recent current prices was very noticeable. The good business prevailing will, however, assist in bringing about the necessary advanced rates more rapidly, and a further week or two will, no doubt, find the revised scale of prices established.

Very few arrivals are now reported, with the result that the stock yards at the various ports begin to show prominently numerous vacant spaces; it will require however, a steady continuation of good business to reduce the stocks below the ordinary normal state, as all the sorts are still fully represented.

In the freight market a further amount of business has been done during the week, with little or no alteration on the figures given last week, 35s. Swedish ports to Firth of Forth seems to be established, although
