THE NORTH BRITISH RAILWAY Co., who, a few years ago, brought in a branch railway from their Morningside Railway to Carluke, are now erecting a goods station there. Mr. John Muir, joiner, Carluke, has the contract for erecting the goods shed, which will cost about £300. This new railway will be of great service to Carluke. The Caledonian Railway Company are also putting up at Carluke station Stables, the contract for which has been secured by Mr. Thomas Pettigrew, joiner, Carluke, at a trifle under £300.
