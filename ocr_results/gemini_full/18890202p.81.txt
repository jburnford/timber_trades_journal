FEBRUARY 2, 1889.]

MESSRS. CURRY & SHREEVE, for thirteen years with Messrs. Sandell & Co., have established themselves in business at 1A, Hardcastle Street, High Street, Peckham, S.E., as mahogany and timber merchants, wood moulding manufacturers, and importers of doors, &c.

AT the last meeting of the Minster Guardians a letter was received from a firm of wood merchants, offering to supply a cargo of deal ends for wood-chopping purposes, at £5 10s. The Master reported that there was a good stock of wood on the premises, and the Clerk was instructed to write and decline the offer.

AT the last meeting of the Canterbury Board of Guardians the Clerk read a letter from Messrs. Douglas & Co., timber merchants, offering to supply a cargo (60 fathoms) of firewood at £5 per fathom, and deals and battens at £5 10s., delivered at Faversham. The members of the Board thought they could not do with such a quantity, and it was decided not to accept the offer.

THE partnership between Mr. Wm. Rowland and Mr. Richard Holme, who traded as timber merchants at 9A, Canada Dock, Liverpool, under the style of Rowland, Holme, & Co., has been dissolved by mutual consent. All debts will be paid and received by Mr. R. Holme, and Mr. Wm. Rowland will henceforth carry on business at 56A, Regent Street, Canada Dock, Liverpool, as Wm. Rowland & Co., timber merchants.

ON Thursday week the workmen employed in the timber yard of Messrs. Taylor & Butler were invited by Mr. J. R. Butler, the managing partner, to a dinner at the White Hart Hotel, Manningtree, in celebration of his marriage. In addition to the workmen, Mr. Butler invited several friends to join him at the festive table, the company numbering about forty. An excellent dinner was laid, and the guests spent a most enjoyable evening.

SUSSEX COUNTY COUNCIL.—This county seems fully alive to the necessity of having its great industry of wood and timber fully represented. Mr. C. Longley (H. Longley & Sons), as announced last week, has been returned for Ditchling; Mr. H. Puttock, for Billinghurst; Mr. W. Stenning (John Stenning & Son), for East Grinstead; Mr. C. H. Stenning, J.P. (late of the same firm), for Winchelsea; and Mr. J. Vidler for Rye. These gentlemen were in each case returned without opposition.

ALDERMAN WINTERTON, of Winterton & Sons, timber merchants, Leicester, is the first subject of a series of “Pen and Ink Sketches” which are appearing in the *Midland Free Press*. The writer observes that “the alderman is one of a large class of men who are the backbone, and in many respects the pride of the nation—sturdy, independent, upright, diligent in business, with a warm place in his heart for home and friends, proud of his sons and daughters, as he may well be—and, as I said at the outset, bent on doing his utmost to leave the old town, in which he has lived now sixty or seventy years, better than he found it.”
