The debtor's statement of affairs disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £2,266 3s. 10d., of which £2,100 6s. 8d. is expected to rank as fully secured creditors. The unsecured liabilities amount to £165 17s. 2d. and assets nil. It appeared that the debtor had engaged in building small houses with borrowed capital. No resolution were passed, and as the debtor had been already adjudicated bankrupt, it was decided to appoint the Official Receiver as trustee to wind up the estate in bankruptcy.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 107\n—The meeting for public examination in this case was held on Friday week before Mr. Registrar Brougham. The bankrupt, late of Campden Road, South Croydon, returned his gross liabilities at £19,890, of which, however, not more than £783 10s. is expected to rank, and assets £101 5s. The case has been already reported in the Timber Trades Journal, and the bankrupt passed his examination.\nHOWELL, E. C. & SON, builders and contractors, Lambeth, Woodford, and Bristol.— The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Friday week before Mr. Brougham, Assistant Receiver. The case was reported in our last issue, the joint liabilities being returned at £32,686 0s. 7d., of which £21,898 7s. 6d. are expected to rank, and assets estimated at £4,530 9s. There was a large attendance of creditors. The numerous proofs having been read over, it was stated that the debtors were unable to make any proposal. The chairman expressed his opinion that the case was one which required some investigation. It appeared to him that the failure had arisen from the debtors having taken contracts at too low a rate. They were taken practically at a loss, and the remarks also applied to the Woodford contract. Mr. Howell, senior: I am afraid that is an assumption and not an absolute fact. The committee who investigated on behalf of creditors decided that the Woodford contract was a profitable one. This statement provoked a warm discussion, diverse opinions being expressed respecting the Woodford contract, some speakers expressing their conviction that it was not a profitable contract and others that the prices were remunerative. Mr. Wiggins (representing Messrs. Farmiloe) asked for information respecting the bankrupts' expenditure. It was put down at £1,200 a year, and it was suggested that the amount was very extravagant. Mr. Howell, senior: That is for the two and includes travelling expenses. He further stated that about two or three years ago he had a very decent house at Bristol and kept two horses. Mr. Wiggins: There is a very large deficiency, and I believe that you were insolvent two years ago. I say that extravagance in living on your part has conduced very much to our loss as creditors. The chairman said that the drawings since November appeared to have amounted to £490. After further discussion the proceedings, in the absence of any proposal, resulted in bankruptcy, and Mr. R. J. Ward, accountant, Bloomsbury Mansions, was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection consisting of Mr. Hollands (Lindsay & Co.), Mr. Wiggins (T. & W. Farmiloe), Russell Coote (Warren & Co.), Mr. Harris, and Mr. John Brown.\nHUTCHENS, THOMAS S., builders' foreman, of Streatham.—This debtor attended before Mr. Registrar Willoughby and Mr. Shirtcliffe, Deputy Official Receiver, for public examination. The debtor stated that he commenced business as a builder in 1879 with a capital of £200, and that he went into partnership with Mr. W. Scarfe, of Putney, builder. The partnership existed two years and a half, and was then dissolved by mutual consent. He has been for the last three years employed as a builders' foreman at a weekly salary of £2 5s., but he had just received notice of dismissal. In 1883 he filed a petition for liquidation of his affairs in the Wandsworth Court, with liabilities about £2,000, and assets (equities in properties) about £2,000. No dividend was paid, and he (the debtor) applied for and obtained his discharge about June 1884. The debtor said he was connected by marriage with the Mayor of a Surrey borough. The debtor was examined by Mr. Noogen, who appeared for a creditor, after which the examination was adjourned.\nKELVIE, WILLIAM, steam saw-mill proprietor and firewood merchant, River Bank, North Street, New Charlton.—The statement of affairs discloses gross liabilities £993 12s. 9d.; creditors unsecured, £991 0s. 3d.; the assets, which consist of cash in hand, £6; fixtures, fittings, &c., £60; furniture, £10; other property, £27; book debts, £4 10s., make a total of £97 10s. from which the sum of £2 12s. 6d. is to be deducted for preferential creditors. The deficiency is £896 2s. 9d. The receiving order was made on the debtors own petition, and he (the debtor) states that he commenced business as a steam saw-mill proprietor and firewood merchant, in October, 1883, with a capital of £300, and he has produced a \"bought goods\" and day book, which have been indifferently kept, and do not show his business transactions and financial position for the three years immediately preceding his bankruptcy. He does not appear to have kept any record of his receipts and payments. The \"other property\" consists of three vans, a horse, two saw benches and fixed chaff and weighing machines. The debtor\n\nstates that he became aware of his insolvency during the last twelve months. The debtor gives no detailed account of his deficiency. The following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nJewett George, London ... ... ... 300 2 3\nLow R., London ... ... ... 27 10 0\nMay A., London ... ... ... 49 10 0\nRoupell S., Richmond ... ... ... 10 0 0\nWith, Webster, & Co., London ... ... 600 0 0\nLLOYD, ISAAC & GEORGE coach-builders, Alfred Place, Aberystwith.—The debtors came up for their public examination at the Town Hall, Aberystwith, on Tuesday last, before Mr. Registrar Davies. In answer to questions the debtors stated that they had been in business in Corporation Street as coachbuilders, and first started in 1871 without capital. They had kept a ledger, but no cash book, and from the commencement their business had not been very flourishing, their average earnings being about £1 per week each. In 1884 everything was sold under a distraint and the house in which they lived was mortgaged for £300.\nPEREIRA, C., builder, Lenthall Road, Dalston, E.—This case has been frequently before the Court, and on Tuesday the bankrupt passed his public examination before Mr. Registrar Linklater. The accounts showed gross liabilities £10,154, of which, however, not more than £1,840 is expected to rank, and assets £46.\nRUTLAND, WM. JAMES, builder and carpenter, Hammersmith.—Mr. G. W. Chapman (Assistant Receiver) presided on Friday week at the first meeting of creditors herein. The receiving order was made on the 9th of January, 1888, upon the debtor's own petition, and the accounts showed total debts of £430 9s. 5d., £385 4s. 8d. being expected to rank, against assets valued at £35 9s. 4d. after allowing £45 4s. 9d. for preferential claims.
