The balance to be carried forward will be £1,842.\nAt the half-yearly meeting of the East and West India Docks Company, the chairman stated that a few of the directors who had had to retire on the reduction of the Board had withdrawn business from the company upon the receipt of very tempting offers from the wharves. One of the best customers of the East and West India Docks Company had also withdrawn his trade. The dividend of 1 per cent. which the directors recommended was a miserably poor one, and to pay it the directors proposed to withdraw £15,000 from the reserve fund.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
