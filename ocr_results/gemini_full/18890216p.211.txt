DOCK COMPANIES' REPORTS &c.
The report of the directors of the Dock Company at Kingston-upon-Hull for the year ending December 31st states that the net receipts enable them to recommend the full dividend of 4 1/4 per cent. on the preference stock, of which 1 per cent. was distributed as an interim dividend on July 1st; but they regret that, notwithstanding the large increase of tonnage which entered the port, they are, owing to the continuance of the present unremunerative scale of dues and rates, only able to recommend a dividend of 1 1/2 per cent. for the past year on the ordinary stock, taking £3,566 from the reserve fund.
The accounts of the Millwall Dock Company for the half-year ending December 31st, 1888, show sufficient net revenue for the directors to recommend at the meeting of the company to be held on February 15th a dividend on the ordinary stock at the rate of £5 per cent. per annum, as against £4 10s. per cent. for the corresponding period in the previous year, and making a total dividend for the whole year of £3 15s. per cent., as against £3 5s. per cent. for the year 1887. The balance to be carried forward will be £1,842.
At the half-yearly meeting of the East and West India Docks Company, the chairman stated that a few of the directors who had had to retire on the reduction of the Board had withdrawn business from the company upon the receipt of very tempting offers from the wharves. One of the best customers of the East and West India Docks Company had also withdrawn his trade. The dividend of 1 per cent. which the directors recommended was a miserably poor one, and to pay it the directors proposed to withdraw £15,000 from the reserve fund.
