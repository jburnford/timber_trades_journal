The deliveries of timber from the ponds are still, however, on a large scale, but these are more representative of consumers' readiness to use past purchases than new transactions. There have been no arrivals of timber cargoes since our last report.\n\nThe steamer Amethyst is loading a cargo of teak for Pembroke Dockyard, and, we believe, there is still more to follow.\n\nThe cargo of Quebec timber now being salved from the William Leavitt, which vessel was wrecked last fall in the Solway Firth when on passage to Greenock, is being gradually brought here by rail.\n\nA considerable addition is to be put to the prison buildings here, and the contract has been given to Mr. Wm. Steel, builder, Greenock.\n\nThe new railway station of the Caledonian Railway Company at Cathcart Street, Greenock, is now nearing completion, and in a few days passengers may expect to see it in its finished state. The frontage towards Cathcart Street, like that inside the station, is of the Gothic style of architecture, and altogether the buildings, which are of Giffnock stone, present a very handsome appearance. The roof extends to 450 ft. in length, and is covered with Pennycook's patent glazing, which reduces the possibility of rain coming through to a minimum.\n\nThe workmanship is altogether of the most substantial character, and reflects the highest credit on Messrs. Watt & Wilson, the contractors.\n\nTo the east of the entrance there is a spare piece of ground, on which, we believe, it is in contemplation to build a handsome sugar exchange for the convenience and accommodation of the Glasgow and Greenock sugar brokers.\n\nLEITH.\nThere have been practically no arrivals of wood goods during the past week, and there\n\nD.

The weather took a wintry turn in the earlier part of the week, but is again inclined to be fresh. A quiet but steady trade continues to be done from the yards.\n\nThe public sale this week was held by Messrs. James Duncan & Co., on Tuesday, 12th inst., at their Seafield and Assembly Street yards; but, owing to the wintry character of the weather, the ground being covered with snow, the attendance was not as large as usual. The broker, Mr. J. W. Hardie, began at Seafield yard with the log timber, consisting of waney pine, oak, elm, ash, sawn pitch pine, and Baltic redwood; but there seemed very little demand for those goods, and prices offered not coming up to exposers' expectations, after selling a few lots the balance was withdrawn. An adjournment was made to the Assembly Street yard, where a large variety of deals, battens, flooring, &c., was offered. There was much better competition for those goods, and a fair proportion of all the different descriptions was placed at prices similar to those current at recent auctions. A quantity of Austrian wainscot logs and American canary-coloured whitewood was also disposed of at 4s. 3d. for the former and 2s. to 2s. 8d. for the latter per cubic foot.\n\nIMPORTS.\nBORROWSTOUNNESS.\nFeb. 11 Mordee (s)-Windau-21,152 pcs. pitwood—Jas.

From a statement of affairs prepared by Messrs. Taylor & Son, the estimated liabilities are £400, and the stock and book debts £350, leaving a deficiency of £50. Mr. S. H. Taylor, the sole surviving partner, is possessed of considerable heritable property, which is, however, mortgaged to a large extent, but if same were realised and fair prices obtained there would be an estimated surplus, after payment of all interests, expenses, realisation, &c., of about £800, out of which he is bound to make up above deficiency. As it is, meantime, most desirable to secure the book debts, the trustee proposes to collect same forthwith, and to allow a reasonable time to realise the heritable property so as to secure a profitable sale.\n\nROBINSON DUNN & CO.,\nTimber Importers,\nPARTICK, GLASGOW.\nSawing, Planing, and Moulding Mills, Partick and Temple.\nTimber Preserving Works, Temple Siding, N.
