Stenning\n(East Grinstead), in the chair; Officio (Godalming,\nSurrey), Burford (Hereford), Lowe (Old\nDalby, Leicestershire), Clark (Narva, Rugby), Miles\n(Stamford), Wright (Fenny Stratford),\nGroom (Hereford), and Miles (Fenny Stratford),\nand Messrs. Ingram and Langley (Longley\nPark, Slough). Mr. Stenning\nwas voted to the chair.\nThe Chairman, in opening the meeting having\nstated the object of the meeting, a survey of the principal\npoints in the proposed new maximum rates and\ncharges was made, and many instances of\nthe great hardship that different railway com-\npanies' proposals would make were pointed out\nby different members. To pass in anything like\ntheir present shape, the charge would not only\nbe a great hardship on foreign timber to a\ngreat many places, but prevent entirely the same\nbeing sent to many places as at present.\nIt was unanimously agreed that it was urgently\nnecessary that all members of the\ntrade, both home and foreign, as well, if\nthey had not already given their special attention\nto the subject, should do so, to withstand to the\nutmost the proposed wholesale charges.\nSpecial attention was called first to the ex-\nception to the terminals in the railway schedules\n(Clause 3 of the general class) as under :—\nNo terminal shall be charged for an exceptional truck,\nor for a truck provided for a special train, such\nas the circumstances of the company may think fit\nto require.\nThe following resolutions were then put to\nthe meeting and carried :—\nProposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Miles\n(Stamford), that the clause mentioned as above,\nso far as exceptional length was concerned,\nshould not be charged for pieces of timber\nunder four tons.\nProposed by Mr. Lowe, and seconded by Mr. Miles\n(Stamford), that special attention to the\nmeasurement of round stone, timber, shall be\ngiven, and that the actual weight, when such weight\ncannot be conveniently ascertained; whereupon\nthe timber shall be measured, and Mr. Lowe seconded,\nthat the measurement be carried at measurement\ngirth.\nProposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Rowland\n(Hereford), that timber classed now in No. 2\nclass be not included in the general merchandise in\nthe proposed new class, but that bottled ales and stout,\ncider and perry in casks, also agricultural machinery\n(not packed, and articles of the like), should be\ncharged at the same rate as scheduled by the various\ncompanies in their present Acts.\nProposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Miles\n(Stamford), that the conditions of old\nActs as to terminals be not proposed,\nbut that the general conditions\nof carriage, as scheduled there, viz.,\nthat the rates for timber remain in force, in-\nstead of the rates now proposed by the com-\npanies.\nProposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Miles\n(Stamford), that this meeting objects to the pay-\nment of siding terminals entirely.\nProposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Miles\n(Stamford), that this meeting objects to the pay-\nment of station terminals, but is willing to\nagree to a fair charge for loading and unloading\nwhen performed by the company.\n\nSTANDING TIMBER.—Mr. Robert\nJones, of the Ship Timber Yard, Neath, has\ncompleted the purchase of growing timber on\nthe estate of Mr. J. Blandy Jenkins, Llan-\nharan.

In his statement of affairs debtor puts his unsecured creditors down at £504, and deficiency £483. He states the causes of his failure to have been too high rent, becoming security for £200 for one of his sons, and bad trade. In reply to Mr. Wharton, Deputy Official Receiver, the debtor said he had been in business twelve years, having commenced with a capital of £700 or £800. He owed nothing then. He had mortgaged his property a good bit since he had been in business. What caused him to commence borrowing money was that he bought some timber of the Canal Company. They went into liquidation, and that cost him about £150. He estimated his loss on the business last year was £71. After some further questions debtor was allowed to pass his public examination.\nCROOKES, BROCKLESBY, builder, Woodhall Spa, Lincoln, &c.—At the Lincoln County Court, on Saturday last, before his Honour Judge Stephen, this bankrupt applied for his discharge.
