TIMBER MERCHANTS AND THE NEW RAILWAY RATES.
A MEETING.
A meeting of the Committee of the
Timber Trade of England and
the Home-grown Merchants' Associa-
tion was held at the offices of the Railway and
Canal Traders' Association, Eastcheap Build-
ings, on Wednesday, the 15th inst.
The following were present:—Messrs. Stenning
(East Grinstead), in the chair; Officio (Godalming,
Surrey), Burford (Hereford), Lowe (Old
Dalby, Leicestershire), Clark (Narva, Rugby), Miles
(Stamford), Wright (Fenny Stratford),
Groom (Hereford), and Miles (Fenny Stratford),
and Messrs. Ingram and Langley (Longley
Park, Slough). Mr. Stenning
was voted to the chair.
The Chairman, in opening the meeting having
stated the object of the meeting, a survey of the principal
points in the proposed new maximum rates and
charges was made, and many instances of
the great hardship that different railway com-
panies' proposals would make were pointed out
by different members. To pass in anything like
their present shape, the charge would not only
be a great hardship on foreign timber to a
great many places, but prevent entirely the same
being sent to many places as at present.
It was unanimously agreed that it was urgently
necessary that all members of the
trade, both home and foreign, as well, if
they had not already given their special attention
to the subject, should do so, to withstand to the
utmost the proposed wholesale charges.
Special attention was called first to the ex-
ception to the terminals in the railway schedules
(Clause 3 of the general class) as under :—
No terminal shall be charged for an exceptional truck,
or for a truck provided for a special train, such
as the circumstances of the company may think fit
to require.
The following resolutions were then put to
the meeting and carried :—
Proposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Miles
(Stamford), that the clause mentioned as above,
so far as exceptional length was concerned,
should not be charged for pieces of timber
under four tons.
Proposed by Mr. Lowe, and seconded by Mr. Miles
(Stamford), that special attention to the
measurement of round stone, timber, shall be
given, and that the actual weight, when such weight
cannot be conveniently ascertained; whereupon
the timber shall be measured, and Mr. Lowe seconded,
that the measurement be carried at measurement
girth.
Proposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Rowland
(Hereford), that timber classed now in No. 2
class be not included in the general merchandise in
the proposed new class, but that bottled ales and stout,
cider and perry in casks, also agricultural machinery
(not packed, and articles of the like), should be
charged at the same rate as scheduled by the various
companies in their present Acts.
Proposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Miles
(Stamford), that the conditions of old
Acts as to terminals be not proposed,
but that the general conditions
of carriage, as scheduled there, viz.,
that the rates for timber remain in force, in-
stead of the rates now proposed by the com-
panies.
Proposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Miles
(Stamford), that this meeting objects to the pay-
ment of siding terminals entirely.
Proposed by Mr. Groom, and seconded by Mr. Miles
(Stamford), that this meeting objects to the pay-
ment of station terminals, but is willing to
agree to a fair charge for loading and unloading
when performed by the company.

STANDING TIMBER.—Mr. Robert
Jones, of the Ship Timber Yard, Neath, has
completed the purchase of growing timber on
the estate of Mr. J. Blandy Jenkins, Llan-
haran. The work of felling has now commenced.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BALDWIN, J. T., builder, Copthorne, Worth, Sussex.—The first meeting of creditors in this case was held at the London Bankruptcy Buildings, on Wednesday week, before Mr. Cully, Deputy Receiver for the Brighton district. The debtor filed his own petition, and furnished accounts showing total liabilities £2,148 10s. 7d., of which £426 13s. 10d. are unsecured, and assets £216 16s. 11d.

A composition of 2s. 6d. in the pound was offered by the debtor and refused, and the case accordingly went into bankruptcy, the Official Receiver acting as trustee.
BAKER, DANIEL, wood dealer, North Warnborough, near Odiham.—The sitting for the public examination of this debtor was held at the Winchester Bankruptcy Court last week, before his Honour Judge Leonard. In his statement of affairs debtor puts his unsecured creditors down at £504, and deficiency £483. He states the causes of his failure to have been too high rent, becoming security for £200 for one of his sons, and bad trade. In reply to Mr. Wharton, Deputy Official Receiver, the debtor said he had been in business twelve years, having commenced with a capital of £700 or £800. He owed nothing then. He had mortgaged his property a good bit since he had been in business. What caused him to commence borrowing money was that he bought some timber of the Canal Company. They went into liquidation, and that cost him about £150. He estimated his loss on the business last year was £71. After some further questions debtor was allowed to pass his public examination.
CROOKES, BROCKLESBY, builder, Woodhall Spa, Lincoln, &c.—At the Lincoln County Court, on Saturday last, before his Honour Judge Stephen, this bankrupt applied for his discharge. His Honour granted the
