[FEBRUARY 23, 1889.\n\nThe frost of last week did not last long, and has been followed by mild, spring-like weather, which has been in favour of the trade.\nMessrs. John Mitchell & Co. held a public sale on Tuesday, 19th inst., at their Leith Walk Saw-Mills, when they offered a very large selection of American and Baltic timber, deals, battens, &c. The weather was all that could be desired, and there was a splendid company, both of town and country buyers. The American goods consisted of a large steamer cargo of square and waney board pine and hardwoods landed in December, of Dobell's shipment. A beginning was made with the large waney pine, for which 2s. 10d. to 3s. per cubic foot was got, and as the average size of the logs decreased prices receded to 2s. 8d. to 2s. 9d., at which the largest part of the cargo was placed, whilst for the smaller logs the lowest price touched was 2s. 6d. per cubic foot. Except for the largest logs, for which the prices seemed somewhat low, the waney pine sold well, quality being prime. In the square pine, which was only 2nd quality, prices ranged from 1s. 8d. to 2s. 3d. per cubic foot. Ash fetched 1s. 9d. to 1s. 11d.; canary whitewood, a mere balance, 1s. 9d. to 2s. per cubic foot. A large quantity of Windau redwood logs, chiefly small sizes and short average lengths, was placed at 1s. 1d. to 1s. 1½d. per cubic foot. For the Quebec walnut there was comparatively little inquiry, but buyers' wants were supplied at 4s. 9d. to 5s. 4d. There was good competition for the yellow pine deals, 1st quality broads fetching 3s. 4d. to 3s. 6d., 11 in. deals 2s. 9d. to 2s. 10½d., and ends 2s. 7d. to 2s. 8½d., whilst for 3rd quality 1s. 4d. was got. Besides those goods already mentioned, a great variety of Baltic deals, battens, floorings, &c., were offered, and good lines placed, so that the total quantity of goods disposed of was very large indeed, and the exposers are to be congratulated on the result. Mr. D. W. Beattie acted as broker, and it was late before the sale concluded.\n\nD. W.

The yard has been closed for five years, will be fitted with machinery suitable for constructing clads and the largest type of merchant ships.\n\nHOME WOOD SALE.—About 200 lots of home wood, chiefly ash, were disposed of on the 13th inst. at Bognie, Banffshire. Prices ruled low on account of several similar sales having recently taken place in the neighbourhood, and also because there was a fear lest the trees which were usually near roads or fences, might have nails in them—or, as expressed by one bidder, \"That ane has staples in her.\" Large trees went at from 4s. to 12s., limbs for firewood 2s. to 3s. 6d., and brushwood 6d. to 1s. 6d. per lot.\n\nDESTRUCTION OF TREES.—As evidence of the strength of the tempest of the 8th inst., it may be stated that a great many trees have been blown down on the wood on Quarrywood Hill, the number knocked over being estimated at 400.\n\nBELL & SIME,\nTimber Merchants,\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of AMERICAN and BALTIC WOODS.
