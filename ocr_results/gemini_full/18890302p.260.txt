It is stated that Mr. Dobell, of Quebec, is at present in England, with a view of promoting a scheme for a cable service between England and Canada through the Straits of Belleisle, at one-fifth the cost of the existing lines.

At the twenty-ninth annual meeting of the Association of the Chamber of Commerce of the United Kingdom, to be held this month, the following resolution will be proposed:—“That in the opinion of this association it is expedient that in the interests of commerce that a Government Board of Forestry should be established.”

PRACTICAL NOTES.
QUESTIONS.
Cleft Oak Shingles.—Can any of your readers inquirer size (average), thickness, and price per hundred for cleft oak shingles suitable for cleaving the same?—W. N.

Crescent-ground, Hand Saws.—I see, in an American paper, saws advertised under the above title. Can you inform me what peculiarity there is about them?—CROSS-CUT.

Low Water in Steam Boilers.—What is the best way of guarding against this? I am told there are some good automatic alarums now made; are they perfectly reliable?—J. B.

Selecting Oak Timber.—I should esteem it a favour if you would give a young reader a few hints on the above through your “Practical Notes” column, and I have no doubt they would be of use to other of your younger readers.—A BEGINNER.

ANSWERS.
Beds of a Roller Feed Planing Machine.—In reply to “J. & B.,” from his description we should say the man you bought the machine of did not understand his business. The driving power in many machines of this class is enormously increased by allowing the bottom feed rollers to project above the level of the table; this lifts the timber above the bed of the machine, and it has to be brought down to a solid bearing before it is acted on by the cutters. The pressure on the feed rollers, and consequently the power required to drive the feed, can be considerably reduced by dropping the table down slightly in front of the bottom feed rollers; this allows the wood to be fed into the machine on a line with the higher part of the table. The feed rollers should be properly geared.

Yellow Poplar.—In answer to “A. B. C.,” the yellow poplar, known also as the tulip tree or white wood (Siriodendron tulipifera), is found in some parts of Canada and America, but is by no means common. It grows to a considerable size, reaching from 50 to 70 ft. in height, with a trunk of from 3 to 5 ft. in diameter. When young the bark is light brown and smooth, whilst on old trees it is deeply furrowed by longitudinal fissures. Its wood is very valuable, being light, close-grained, strong, and easily worked. It is used for interior work, carriage panels, and the finer fittings of cabinet work, such as drawers and fancy boxes. It is easily bent and is in demand for curved work.

Mixture for Case-hardening Nuts, &c. —In reply to “P. H. B.,” numerous things are used for the above. We can recommend, however, as a first-rate one hydro-carbonated bone black, as it will produce a good, hard, tough case on the nuts and requires no special preparation. We understand it is made by carbonising hard bone in close retorts and charging it with free carbon extracted from hydro-carbon oil. Use cold salt water for cooling. For cutter-block nuts, &c., almost any degree of hardness may be obtained. Prussiate of potash is also used considerably for hardening purposes.

Tenoning Machine.—In reply to “A.B.C.,” we are not aware that any English machine is constructed with the in and out driving belt running on pulleys placed in the centre of the machine between the cutter spindle bearings, but there is an American machine (made by C. B. Rogers & Co., Norwich, Connecticut) which is driven in this way, the belt passing down through the centre of a hollow column. The object of placing the belt between the bearings is, of course, to equalise the strain and consequent wear of the belt, and we do not recommend individual firms. We [?]
