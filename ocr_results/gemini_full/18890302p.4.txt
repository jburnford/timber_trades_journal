4 The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.

there is a very fair amount of business doing.
There is a fair stock of deals here of most kinds, and, although undergoing steady diminution, it will be found there is sufficient to meet all requirements.
Quebec freights are still tending upwards, 27s. 6d. having now been paid to Greenock.

LEITH.
The arrivals of wood goods during the past week are restricted to some staves and hoops, a cargo of firewood, and a small cargo of battens, the latter from Laurvig.
The weather has again become more wintry, but not so severe as to interfere much with building operations, so that the trade moves steadily along.
The public sale this week was held by Messrs. William Thomson & Co. on Tuesday, 26th inst., at the Sands, when they offered the balance of two shipments of waney and square pine, along with some ash and wainscot.
There was a fair attendance of buyers, and a considerable quantity of the pine was placed.
The prices read low, but, taking into consideration that the wood was not of recent importation, and quality not prime, fair values were got, waney boards ranging from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 5½d. and square 1s. 7d. to 1s. 8d. per cubic foot.
For the ash and wainscot there was no inquiry, and the goods were accordingly passed.
Thereafter the same brokers offered for account of Messrs. A. Garland & Roger a varied assortment of deals and battens, chiefly Baltic and Norwegian goods, of which a fair proportion was disposed of at satisfactory prices.

MONTROSE.
For some time a rather quieter trade has been experienced here, but a considerable improvement is now felt in the timber trade.
Messrs. Millar & Son's saw-mills, which have for some months past been working short time, have again resumed the full working hours, and there is every indication of this improved position being maintained.
The wrecked cargo of pit props is being reloaded up in another vessel, and will be conveyed to Sunderland, its destination.
