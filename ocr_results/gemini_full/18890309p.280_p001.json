[MARCH 9, 1889.\n\nrecommendation is based would seem to warrant a confident expectation of satisfactory results in practice, but repeated experiments with charred timber have furnished conclusive evidence that this process will not promote its durability.\nIndeed, numerous trials have shown that charring leads to premature decay.\nTwo posts split from the same log may be set side by side in the ground, the surface of one being charred and the other not, and it will be seen that the charred post will perish before the other.\nThe same is true of railway ties and all such timber as may be exposed to the alternating influences of wet and heat.\nCould the entire timber be changed from its perishable condition to one solid piece of charcoal, the durability would be promoted to a surprising length of time, but then the strength of the material would be destroyed.\nWhen fence posts or other pieces of timber are exposed to the rapid action of wet and heat, the surface will decay first.\nIt might be supposed, therefore, that when timber is enveloped by a layer of charcoal, the durability of the entire piece would be greatly promoted.\nSuch would be the case if it were not for the fact that charcoal is not impervious to water, and as water reaches the timber beneath the charred surface, decay will commence soon after the grain of the wood has been exposed to the influences of the weather.\nWhen the change has once begun beneath the charred surface, the durable covering of charcoal will be of no service whatever in preserving any portion of the wood.\nTaking this view of the subject, it will be perceived that if only half an inch of the outside of a post be charred, the post will not endure so long as if the same thickness of wood had been left uncharred to waste away by slow decay.\n\nBUILDING NEWS.\nA new church is to be built at Southend, Campbelltown, N.B.\nTwenty-six houses are to be erected at Wexford.\nA new fire-engine station is to be built at Chelmsford.\nA public hall is to be erected at Cwmaman, Wales.\nNew offices for the Board of Guardians are to be constructed at Frome.\nExtensive additions are to be made to the engine works of Messrs.\nScott & Co., situated in Springkell and Cartburn Streets, Greenock.\nThe cost of the alterations to existing buildings is estimated at about £20,000.\nA new lunatic asylum is to be erected by the Edinburgh Board of Lunacy on their Craighouse estate.\nThe plans prepared by Mr. S.

NEW BRUNSWICK TRADING COMPANY.\nIn the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice on Thursday, the case of Simson & Mason, Limited, v. New Brunswick Trading Company, was set down for hearing before Mr. Baron Huddleston and Mr. Justice Manisty, sitting as a divisional court.\nMr. Patre applied that the case should be allowed to stand out of the paper till Monday week next, on the ground that certain negotiations were in progress between the parties.\nThe negotiations were commenced on the previous day, and it was hoped that a settlement of the litigation would be arrived at.\nThere being no opposition, their lordships granted the application.\n\nDELAY IN SAILING.—THE “PRINDS CARL.”\nThis case came before the Honfleur Tribunal of Commerce.\nIt was a cross action for settlement of freight, in which both parties claimed damages, the charterers, Ullern & Co., for the delay of the ship in sailing; the captain for withholding of freight earned.\nThe ship was at Gothenburg on April 12th last, when she was chartered to load a cargo of timber at Nyhamn and Stugsundet for Honfleur.\nShe sailed from Gothenburg on June 15th, and arrived at Nyhamn on the 29th; shipped a part of her cargo, sailed on July 12th, entered Stugsundet the same day, completed her cargo, and sailed for Honfleur on July 29th.\nThe charterers claimed to deduct 3,000f. from the freight as compensation for the time lost; the captain demanded payment of the 3,000f. withheld, and 1,000f. as damages.\nThe Tribunal said, in giving judgment, that in consequence of the interruption to navigation in the Baltic during the winter it was impossible to fix beforehand a date for ships to proceed to their port of loading, and it was usual to substitute for the date the words “as early as possible” or some similar condition.\nA certain discretion must be left to captains as to the time for putting to sea; but on the other hand the greatest expedition was necessary in the execution of shipping contracts, and captains must not delay their departure without good reason.\nIn this case Captain Jonassen engaged to proceed to Nyhamn with all possible despatch according to circumstances.\nIt was proved by documents put in that navigation was open in the Baltic in the month of May, and in the Gulf of Bothnia before the 15th June.\n\nmonth of May, and in the Gulf of Bothnia before the 15th June.\nThe ship chartered by Ullern & Co., the Alphild, another ship chartered by Ullern & Co., left Gothenburg on the 27th May, and arrived at Westerwik on the 27th, following the same route as that afterwards taken by the Prinds Carl, which arrived 500f. to the charterers as an indemnity, to be deducted from the freight, and condemned Captain Jonassen to pay all the costs.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of shippers when by so doing a line can be saved.\nImports of mahogany, &c., appear under the heading of “Mahogany and Hardwoods” on another page, and the Scotch Imports in the “Scotch Supplement.”—ED.]\nBARROW.\nMar. 4 Buccleugh (s)—Porsgrund—198,274 staves, 113,089 boards—F.
