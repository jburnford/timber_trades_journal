SWEDISH MATCH COMPANY.
On Wednesday afternoon the first annual ordinary general meeting of the Swedish Match Company, Limited, was held at Cannon Street Hotel, the chairman of the company, Mr. E. C. Warren, presiding. From the report it appeared that up to December 31st last the business had been carried on at a loss of £1,192. The Chairman, in moving the adoption of the report, said at the last meeting he had expressed himself in very hopeful terms of the prospects of the company, and he had good grounds for so doing, but he was sorry to say that those anticipations had not been realised. In the first place the export trade fell off to an alarming extent. The Japanese started match factories, and took away their trade with China; but these factories had failed, and their China trade had come back to them. Then there was a great reduction in prices, which meant simply starvation. Another cause of their position was strikes amongst the workmen, which had given them a great deal of trouble. They had also had one of their factories on fire, which had caused great inconvenience and loss. Above and beyond all they had had to deal with excessive competition. This had been brought about in order to crush the Swedish Company, and many of the factories had been altogether ruined. Hence the necessity for the so-called match union, which, however, had not yet been formed, and could not be without the assistance of that company. The directors had, instead of proclaiming their troubles, gone on with their work, and had something to show. The output was small, and in order to keep the trade together they had bought matches from others who were selling them cheaper than the company could make them. The first year's expenses, which were, as a matter of course, very heavy, had all
