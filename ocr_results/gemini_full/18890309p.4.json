Sandison\n\nINTERESTING ACTION FOR DEMURRAGE.\nBefore Sheriff Scott-Moncrieff, Falkirk, Erik Christensen, master of the schooner Trinde, of Skjelskjor, and Hans Fischer, merchant, Grangemouth, sued Messrs. Brownlee & Co., timber merchants, Grangemouth, for a claim for demurrage.\nAfter hearing proof for pursuers, and the agents, Mr. Thomas Gibson for pursuers, and Mr. Stirling, of A. & J. C. Allan, for defenders, the Sheriff on Tuesday last issued his decision.\nHe said the case was one of considerable interest and importance to all concerned in shipping transactions.\nOriginally, the claim was at the rate of £5 per day for four days' demurrage, but the pursuers' claim was subsequently restricted to £12, and the case was remitted to the Small Debt Roll.\nThe ship arrived in Grangemouth Docks on the afternoon of Friday, 30th November last, but owing to the lateness of the hour nothing could be done that night.\nThe defenders, however, seemed to have had no proper notice of the arrival until the morning of the following Tuesday, when they directed the vessel to proceed to another part of the harbour, and those on board the vessel discharged the cargo certainly in a leisurely fashion.\nThe case divided itself into two points.\nThe first was a legal one.\nThe pursuers were bound to intimate the arrival of their ship, and were consequently responsible for any delay which might have been caused by their failure to do so.\nHe was, however, of opinion that in regard to this point the law was upon the side of the pursuers.\nHe referred to English decisions, which, although not binding, not, so far as he was aware, superseded the cases of Harman v. Clarke and others.\n\nBEATTIE, DUNDEE.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and White Pine, Wainscot Flooring, and Pitch Pine, also Teak, Greenheart, and all kinds of Hardwoods.\n\nTelegraphic Address— \"PATON,\" AYR.\nJAMES DONALDSON,\nTimber Merchant, AYR.\nTAYPORT.\nTelegraph Address— DONALDSON, TAYPORT.
