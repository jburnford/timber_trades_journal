INTERESTING ACTION FOR DEMURRAGE.
Before Sheriff Scott-Moncrieff, Falkirk, Erik Christensen, master of the schooner Trinde, of Skjelskjor, and Hans Fischer, merchant, Grangemouth, sued Messrs. Brownlee & Co., timber merchants, Grangemouth, for a claim for demurrage.
After hearing proof for pursuers, and the agents, Mr. Thomas Gibson for pursuers, and Mr. Stirling, of A. & J. C. Allan, for defenders, the Sheriff on Tuesday last issued his decision.
He said the case was one of considerable interest and importance to all concerned in shipping transactions.
Originally, the claim was at the rate of £5 per day for four days' demurrage, but the pursuers' claim was subsequently restricted to £12, and the case was remitted to the Small Debt Roll.
The ship arrived in Grangemouth Docks on the afternoon of Friday, 30th November last, but owing to the lateness of the hour nothing could be done that night.
The defenders, however, seemed to have had no proper notice of the arrival until the morning of the following Tuesday, when they directed the vessel to proceed to another part of the harbour, and those on board the vessel discharged the cargo certainly in a leisurely fashion.
The case divided itself into two points.
The first was a legal one.
The pursuers were bound to intimate the arrival of their ship, and were consequently responsible for any delay which might have been caused by their failure to do so.
He was, however, of opinion that in regard to this point the law was upon the side of the pursuers.
He referred to English decisions, which, although not binding, not, so far as he was aware, superseded the cases of Harman v. Clarke and others.
