REVIEWS.
Bousfield's Slide Rules. (GEO. BOUSFIELD, Sylvan Crescent, Grimsby.)
This instrument has now been before the trade nearly two years, and is being adopted by many of the leading timber firms of the country, and has fully justified the laudable position it has obtained as a veritable vade mecum to the timber trade.
One of the rules strikes us as being particularly useful to the trade, and the rapidity of its operation is simply marvellous. For example, supposing you wish to know the Petersburg standard quantity of 760 ft. 3 x 7. by simply placing the two sides together on the corresponding edges of the slide and frame marked respectively F and B, and casting your eye on the opposite edge of the rule marked J, reading the figures tenfold, you observe opposite 760 0-2-20 on the middle of the column. In addition to this, immediately in line with it, and without disturbing the slide, is 110 cubic feet which is the cubic contents of the standard quantity.
Though the special features of this rule are designed for the timber trade (the above example being one amongst many), the volume of general work it is capable of performing is surprising. So much is this the case that calculations of all kinds are given with a speed and exactness that, compared with the ordinary mode of calculations by pen and figures, is really wonderful. What is more, the rules can be worked, like "Jack's compass," the reverse way as easily as in the order given, e.g., having set the two sizes together and looking opposite 0-0-20 you will find the number of lineal feet contained in that standard quantity of 3x7.
As an invention it may truly be termed the shorthand of arithmetic, and the mastering of its technicalities is calculated to place a merchant or trade accountant or clerk on the same elevated position as that occupied by an expert in shorthand over a non-expert.
It may fearlessly be asserted that the working of the instrument will quickly pay its cost, and leave the purchaser an expert in squares, cubes, decimals, duodecimals, multiples, and roots, or a veritable genius in calculation.
Railway Rates. (Sweet & Maxwell, London.)
This is the title of an opportune compilation by Mr. W. A. Hunter, LL.D., M.P., and very fully enters into an exposition of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888. It is prefaced by a short history of railway legislation from 1823-1888, and deals with maximum rates, terminal charges, the revised classification and schedule of rates, the revised rates and maximum rates of the principal railway companies, the latter being in full, and it also gives an appendix containing the rules of the Board of Trade for canals. This will prove a useful publication to traders at the present moment, and may be read by them with profit and interest.
Golden South Africa. (B. Whittingham & Co., London.)
We have received a copy of the revised and fourth edition of this work, which, owing to the interest taken by investors in South Africa is having a large sale. It is the only popular handbook on this part of the world, and having been written upon personal knowledge of the country, and also personal investigation of the facts dealt with, is extremely reliable. The book contains five first-rate maps, and as a history of a wonderful country, apart from its value as a guide to the investor, is full of interesting and entertaining matter. We congratulate Mr. E. P. Mathers, F.R.G.S., who is the author, upon the excellence and the popularity of his work, and also upon his very readable and useful weekly publication, South Africa, which continues and supplements, with a record of passing events, the information he has given us of that region, which an enthusiastic poet has described as a—
Healthy, salubrious clime,
Where none sickly live or die before their time.
Spon's Builders' Price Book, 1889. (E. & F. N. Spon, London.)
This excellent work has now reached its sixteenth edition, and is replete with information for the architect and builder; it is well printed, and the arrangement of the matter being in alphabetical sequence, any desired formula or memorandum can be turned up in a moment.

MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL.—During the last three weeks great progress has been made in cutting the Manchester Ship Canal. On the Weaste section night shifts are being worked by the aid of Well's marine light. Through railway communications have been established between Salford and Irlam station on the Cheshire lines, and ballast engines are running in every direction on the track lines which have been laid in the various sections between Salford and Warburton on the Lancashire side of the Irwell. Further on cutting operations are going on at the Trafford Park side of the River Irwell, opposite the old lock-house at Barton. Great strides are being made with the work at Eastham, where an immense excavation for the entrance-gates and locks is almost completed; and on all the sections vigorous efforts are being made to push matters forward as rapidly as possible.
