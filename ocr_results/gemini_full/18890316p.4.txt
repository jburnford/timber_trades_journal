SHOCKING DEATH.—On Thursday morning, Henry Ponsford, living at No. 30, Upper Baldwin Street, Newport, met with his death in a shocking manner. He was employed at Messrs. Ponsford's saw-mills, on the river side, and was engaged in oiling some machinery which was in motion. By some means or other his clothes got caught in the cogs, and he was forcibly dragged underneath the wheels. The machine was immediately stopped, but it was found that the man had been frightfully injured. He was conveyed with all despatch to the infirmary, but he died immediately after admission. Deceased is a nephew of Mr. Ponsford, the proprietor of the mill. He is about forty years of age, and leaves a widow and large family.

FORESTRY.
IT is a question for foresters to decide whether thinning should be performed with a certain object, say, the growth of a particular tree for a particular purpose—or whether the required tree is planted, and then left to her own devices to draw up in long bare poles, crowded together in that way the most valuable timber; letting a thick mass of undergrowth pass the lower stem of the tree, keep the roots from drought, keep the trees steady in wind, and shed leaves upon the soil. It may be said that the growth of native plants would take more from the soil than it would shed upon it when cut and carried away, therefore more would be taken from the soil than there would be if they were left. If the lower branches of the trees die from crowding, and much of the undergrowth die in the same way, this, with the annual fall of the leaf, will form a rich mould for the successful trees, and a good result is the result. Art skilfully applied with the aid of science can transcend nature, but it cannot be said that forestry has reached that pitch of perfection, and as yet man-made forests have never been rivalled by nature.
Another question of forestry is the present method of planting an admixture of trees, and here the effect on the soil may also be considered. Take, for instance, such useful trees as the oak, the larch, the Spanish chestnut, and the larch. Would it not be better forestry to make plantations of each separately in suitable situations?
