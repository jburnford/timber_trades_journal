Their joint statement of affairs showed liabilities £7,509 5s. 1d., of which £4,500 are fully secured, and £424 partly secured, rank, the assets, after payment of preferential payments, being estimated to produce £1,200, leaving a deficiency of £1,385 5s. 1d.

The debtor says : \"My turnover has been too small to pay my expenses, and I have made several serious losses on building contracts.\" The Official Receiver's observations are as follow : \"The receiving order was made on the petition of the debtor himself.
