FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BLACKMAN, TITSHALL, AND BLACKMAN, coopers and packing case makers, 2, Com-mercial Road, E.—The bankrupts, who were in partnership under the style of "Titshell and Blackman," applied on Tuesday for their public examination before Mr. Registrar Giffard. Their joint statement of affairs showed liabilities £7,509 5s. 1d., of which £4,500 are fully secured, and £424 partly secured, rank, the assets, after payment of preferential payments, being estimated to produce £1,200, leaving a deficiency of £1,385 5s. 1d. The bankrupts attributed their failure to losses in trading during the year 1888, bad debts, depressed state of the timber trade, and increased cost of timber. Mr. G. W. Chapman appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Perks for the trustee. From the accounts of the bankrupts it appeared that in 1887 their books showed a surplus of £1,000, the present deficiency having been incurred since that period. They did not appear to be aware that they were insolvent until January last, when a balance-sheet was prepared by accountants. Mr. Perks asked Mr. Blackman how many orders they had received before calling their creditors together in January—were there sufficient to go on? The bankrupt said he was not aware. As the result the bankrupts were allowed to pass their examination.
COOPER, ALFRED, builder and contractor, 4, Nichols Street, Leicester.—According to the affairs filed by the debtor, the liabilities, amounting to £837 10s. 1d., are expected to rank for £797 10s. 11s. 5d., the deficiency thus being £797 11s. 5d. The debtor says : "My turnover has been too small to pay my expenses, and I have made several serious losses on building contracts." The Official Receiver's observations are as follow : "The receiving order was made on the petition of the debtor himself. He came in business, eleven years ago, at Leicester, without capital, but with a
