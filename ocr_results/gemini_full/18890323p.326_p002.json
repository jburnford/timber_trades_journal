Their joint accounts showed gross liabilities £7,509 5s. 1d., of which £2,517 14s. are fully secured, and £4,901 16s. expected to rank the assets, after providing for preferential payments, being estimated at £974 19s. 11d., leaving a deficiency of £3,926 16s. 1d. The bankrupts attributed their failure to loss in trading during the year 1888, owing to the depressed state of the sugar trade and the increased cost of timber. Mr. Aldridge appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Perks for the trustee. From the examination of the bankrupts it appeared that in July, 1888, their books showed a surplus of £1,600, the present deficiency having been created since that period. They did not, however, become aware that they were insolvent until January last, when a balance-sheet was made up by the accountants. Mr. Perks asked G. F. Blackman how many writs the firm had received before calling their creditors together in January—were there ten or a hundred? The bankrupt said he was unable to say. As a result the bankrupts were allowed to pass their examination.\n\nCOOPER, ALFRED HARDY, builder, 4, Nichols Street, Leicester.—The summary of the affairs filed by the debtor shows liabilities amounting to £837 10s. 11d. and assets £183 4s. 5d., the deficiency thus being £654 19s. 6d. The debtor says: “My turnover has been too small to pay my expenses, and I have had several serious losses on building contracts.” The Official Receiver’s observations are as follow:—“The receiving order was made upon the petition of the debtor himself. He started business, eleven years ago, as a builder, in Leicester, without capital, and from 1881 to 1888 he also carried on business as a grocer, &c., in partnership with a brother-in-law, but now outstanding in respect of the partnership, except to a very small amount. The debtor intends to make an offer of composition, but the proposal has not yet been lodged, and will be sent to the creditors when it is handed in.”\n\nELIAS, WILLIAM OWEN.—In the failure of Mr. William Owen Elias, of Abercromby Square, Liverpool, whose petition was filed in the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court last February, from the statement of affairs to hand it appears that with a revived state of trade, and, locally, with a continuance of the improving state of the property market, there may be reasonable probability of all the creditors receiving their debts in full.\n\nHEATLEY, W., builder, 3 Clifton Square, Peckham, S.E.—Under a receiving order made in this case on the 9th ult. accounts have now been furnished, showing unsecured debts, £1,181 2s. 1d.; debts fully secured, nil; other liabilities not expected to rank, £1,149 2s. 1d. Assets estimated at £796 8s. 6d. The debtor states that he commenced his present business in June, 1886, with £40 borrowed money, also that he has been engaged in connection with another person, in certain\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\ninventions and patents, which have proved unsuccessful. He attributes his insolvency partly to loss and financial complications in connection with the aforesaid patents, and partly to his expenses having been in excess of the profits in his building business, the deficiency being also further explained by losses in betting (£60), by legal and other expenses, and by depreciation in the value of his effects as estimated for realisation. It appears that the bankrupt was previously adjudicated in 1860, and obtained his discharge.\n\nMASON, JOHN, builder, 7 Rudgrave Square, and King Street, Egremont.—This debtor appeared at the Birkenhead Bankruptcy Court last week, before Mr. Registrar Williams, for his public examination upon accounts showing liabilities expected to rank against the estate for dividend £310 4s. 9d. and assets £99 15s. 5d., which shows a deficiency of £210 9s. 4d. It appears from the debtor’s statement that he started business some 50 years ago, and had a capital of £25. His brother afterwards entered into partnership with him, bringing £25 into the business. They failed in 1883, and the joint estate realised only 1s. 0½d. in the pound, but the brother’s separate estate paid 20s. in the pound, and the debtor’s 7s. 6d. in the pound. The debtor obtained his discharge in 1885, and he attributes his present failure to his inability to let or sell a large house which he had erected in Seacomb. The examination was adjourned.\n\nMAYBURY, JOHN, builders’ merchant, 174, Commercial Road, Newport (Mon.), and London and North-Western Wharf, Cardiff, Glamorganshire.—The first meeting of creditors was held in this matter at the offices of the Official Receiver last week, and Mr. L. Phillips represented the debtor. The statement of affairs shows liabilities amounting to £2,046 11s. 7d., and assets, after deducting preferential claims payable in full, £1,654 18s. 9d., or a deficiency of £391 12s. 10d. Mr. Phillips said the offer he could make was a composition of 10s. in the pound, payable by instalments at six, nine, and twelve months, without security. The Official Receiver remarked it would be useless considering such a proposal, as the Court would not sanction it, and therefore the only course was to elect a trustee. A resolution was accordingly passed adjudicating the debtor bankrupt, and appointing Mr. A. R. Bear to the post of trustee.\n\nMcKELVIE, WILLIAM, firewood merchant, of Charlton.—The public examination of this debtor was held last week at the Greenwich Court, before Mr. Deputy Registrar Bristow, and Mr. Cecil Mercer, Official Receiver. The debtor was represented by Mr. J. T. Moss, solicitor, while Mr. Tabor appeared for Messrs. With, Webster, & Co., who are creditors. The debtor in his examination said he commenced business in 1883 with a capital of £300, his wife’s money. He was a firewood merchant and bought his timber from Messrs. With, Webster, & Co., and Mr. Jewett, the former being creditors for about £600. Asked what he had done with goods from trade creditors to the value of £900, he replied that he had sold the wood made from their goods and sent as much money as he could get to the creditors. He could only account for his deficiency on the assumption that the cargoes of timber he had bought were short, though he did not assert that they were. He had signed receipts for them. In reply to the Registrar he admitted that some times the cargo would exceed the quantity ordered. He had been unable to pay his creditors 20s. in the pound during the whole of last year. Mr. Tabor then examined the debtor, who denied having given Mrs. Skinner, to whom the business had been sold, the money to buy the business with. In January, 1887, when he opened a fresh account with Messrs. With, Webster, & Co., he considered himself clear, for though he owed Messrs. Jewett £400 he had stock to cover it. His receipts were from £35 to £50 a week. In round figures the difference between his expenses and receipts at £35 to £50 a week was £1,700 a year, and he could only account for the loss of this amount by suggesting that the quantity of wood ordered was short on delivery. He himself was carrying on the business, but it was carried on in the name of Sullivan, his man. The business had been sold to Mrs. Skinner for £70, but he did not know what she would do with it: She would have to sell it, but in the meantime he and Sullivan, his man, were carrying it on, and taking the profits. After some further examination by the Official Receiver, the debtor was ordered to file further accounts and the examination was adjourned.\n\nMORGAN, JAMES THOMAS, and MORGAN, THOMAS GOWLAND, trading as Morgan Bros., boatbuilders, Gorleston, Suffolk.\n\n327\nThe following statement of affairs has been filed under this recent failure:—Liabilities to unsecured creditors, £4,898 14s. 9d.; creditors fully secured, £450; estimated value of securities, £500; surplus of which carried to contra; to creditors partly secured, £21,184 19s. 10d.; less estimated value of securities, £10,034 4s., leaving £11,150 15s. 10d. to rank; to preferential creditors, £265 10s. 11d. deducted per contra, being payable in full; total £16,049 10s. 7d.; and assets, consisting of stock-in-trade, £1,500, estimated to produce £500; book debts (good), £672 19s.; and surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured, £150, making £265 10s. 11d. from which £265 10s. 11d. for preferential claims as per contra has to be deducted, leaving £607 8s. 1d., which shows a deficiency of £15,442 2s. 6d.

Unsecured debts £412 16s. 11d. and debts fully secured nil.\nSAGE, E. & J. W., builders, Bramham Gardens, South Kensington, W.—The adjourned first meeting of creditors in this case (previously reported) was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Chapman, Assistant Receiver. The joint account showed unsecured debts £8,018 7s. 9d., and debts fully secured £98,372 10s.; assets—book debts £3 4s. 11d., and estimated surplus from securities held by creditors £14,590 19s. 9d. The debtors attribute their failure to inability to realise their houses, and especially to the non-letting of the Bramham Gardens property, which prevented their raising permanent mortgages thereon. The meeting adjourned in the hope that the debtors might be enabled to make a proposal, but Mr. Tempany, who attended on their behalf, now stated that the position taken up by mortgagees was such as to preclude the possibility of any satisfactory arrangement. He had seen two of the Bristol mortgagees, two of whom positively stated that they intended to prove for deficiencies, two others reserving their right to prove, and one only stating that he was satisfied. It was most unfortunate for the creditors that the negotiations should have fallen through, but much regretted the result, but the mortgagees put it out of their power to make any proposal. The proceedings accordingly resulted in bankruptcy, and Mr. Leroy Mason, accountant, King",
