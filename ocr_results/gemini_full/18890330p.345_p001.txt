CORRESPONDENCE
RAILWAY RATES.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—With reference to the regulation of railway rates referred to by your correspondents, Messrs. Evans Bros., of Canada Dock, Liverpool, at page 303 of your impression of the 16th inst., I have nothing to object to in the view they take of adhering to a hard and fast line of measurement.
It would at least be simple and intelligible to the timber trade if a list were sent them indicating what quantity of each separate description would go for a ton.
But there is one concession required by Evans Bros. from railway companies on which the latter would have a good deal to say for themselves, and possibly with the ear of the Board of Trade too.
I am as averse to terminal charges per se as your correspondent, but cannot agree that haulage to the particular destination of the goods under the denomination of "levying charges whether incurred or not."
For instance, Mr. A., a timber merchant, may have his yard convenient to the railway station of the place where he carries on business, and thinks how easily the company might run the goods right into his premises free of charge; but how about Mr. B., a contractor in the next street, who is building a country mansion a mile or two off the main road, and who instructs the importer with whom he deals to be sure to direct the timber he has bought to be delivered at the spot where it is to be used?
These are extreme cases, perhaps, and the rule might be limited to a certain radius from every station, and always on a good thoroughfare; there are, of course, ways of adjusting these matters if once the system of plan is permanently settled upon.
By keeping our demands within reasonable limits, we are more likely to carry the Board of Trade with us, and where so much argument, and possible litigation too, is already looming up, it may not be good policy to stand for too much.
The interests of the railways themselves, and on their trading facilities, and what is good for the timber trade in this system of traffic, cannot fail of being equally beneficial to the railway companies.
They would probably find it pay better to carry 3 tons for 12s. 6d. than 2 for 10s.—Yours, &c.,
A TIMBER MERCHANT.
Glo'ster, March 23rd, 1889.

SIMSON & MASON, LIMITED.
An extraordinary meeting of Simson & Mason, Limited, was held on the 25th inst. at the City Terminus Hotel, E.C., Mr. L. J. J. Mason presiding, to confirm a resolution passed on the 8th inst., altering the articles of association, so that "as remuneration for their services the directors, including the managing directors, shall in every year in which the dividend distributed and paid to the shareholders out of profits, and the amount carried to 'reserve fund' shall together be not less than 10 per cent. upon the capital paid up, or credited as paid up, be entitled to receive and take out of the surplus profits of such year, for their remuneration, a sum not exceeding £5 per cent. upon the amount paid up, or considered as paid up, upon the issued capital for the time being of the company."
The chairman moved that the resolution be confirmed, which was seconded by Mr. Henry Mason.
Mr Thompson (Belfast) opposed the motion on the ground that it was inconsistent with the terms of the prospectus.
Mr. Logan, replying to Mr. Thompson, said his remarks showed a want of knowledge of events.
The resolution that a reserve fund be formed was unanimously passed at the previous meeting.
The subject was first raised by the shareholders themselves—it was not the directors' doing at all.
The simple alteration now suggested was that instead of the shareholders receiving actually 10 per cent. dividend in cash, as first provided in the prospectus, part of this should be reserved.
The directors would not receive any remuneration until 10 per cent. had been accounted for in the form of dividend and reserve.
Any interest on reserve would be credited to it, and of course for the benefit of the shareholders.
Mr. Thompson, after hearing Mr. Logan's remarks, and receiving the chairman's confirmation, withdrew all he had said, and voted in favour of the resolution, which was carried unanimously.
The proceedings then terminated.

TRADE ITEMS.
MELBOURNE EXHIBITION.—Messrs. W. Tyzack, Sons, & Turner, saw and edge tool and file manufacturers, of Little London Works, Sheffield, have just received a first-class award at the recent Melbourne Exhibition.
This firm also received this distinction with a gold medal at the exhibition at Melbourne in 1881.

MR. LEONARD MARSHALL, timber merchant, of Old Street, London, E.C., member of the Holborn Guardians Board and St. Luke's Vestry, was last Saturday elected to the Suffolk County Council for the Mildenhall Division.

MESSRS. Eckersley Brothers, sole manufacturers of the "Oldham" Boiler Fluid, late 127, Lees Road, have removed to Townfield Mill Terrace and Corn Street, Oldham, where they will in future conduct the manufacture of their specialities—namely, the "O."

FIRE AT AN IRISH SAW-MILL.—About midnight on Saturday, March 23rd, a fire broke out in the timber saw-mills of Mr. Beckett, Castlebar, county Mayo.
A detachment of Welsh Fusiliers with fire engine, under command of Major Knox, and constabulary, rendered service in extinguishing the flames.
The saw-mill engine was much damaged, and a large quantity of timber was rendered almost useless.

THE report of the Sunderland Shipowners Society's annual meeting contains the speech of Mr. J. Y. Short, senior member of the firm of Short Bros., timber merchants of that port, in which that gentleman urged that representatives of the outports on Lloyd's Committee should be increased, that Lloyd's charges for the classification of new vessels should be lessened, and that it was desirable to modify the Board of Trade's method of measuring for tonnage erections on the tonnage deck.

Messrs. King & Scarborough's tender was accepted.

ENGLISH TIMBER SALES.
SUFFOLK.—On the 21st and 22nd inst. Messrs. Wright & Scruby held a sale of 50 oak and 500 larch trees at Poslingford Estate.
The oak was of medium size, and of first-rate quality, the size of the larch being the same, and the quality fairly good.
The former realised 2s. 3d. per cube foot, and the latter 10d. to 1s. per cube foot.
Owing to the bad weather on the first day's sale, there was only a small attendance of buyers, but on the second day they showed up in fairly good numbers.
The principal purchasers were Messrs. Rattee & Kelt (Cambridge), C. Parker (Wickhambrooke), S. Rye (Elm swell), and W. & A. Hitchcock (Sudbury).

THEFT OF WOOD.—At the Wisbech Borough Police Court, on Friday week, before the Mayor (Mr. J. Goward) and Mr. J. Leach, Thomas Langley, 13, and Ernest Evans, 12, were charged with stealing wood from the yard of Messrs. Hiscox and Smith.
Evans was sentenced to ten days' imprisonment and two years in a reformatory, and Langley was discharged with a caution.

WOODEN BUILDINGS AS BILLIARD ROOMS.
—The Metropolitan Board of Works have, as a closing act of their lives, decided not to sanction wooden buildings for billiard rooms, although the outsides may be rendered incombustible by the application of a certain sort of paint, so Mr. H. Roffey, a builder, carrying on business in Upper Richmond Road, has been ordered by Mr. Curtis-Bennett to demolish his building under a penalty of 40s. a day.
Mr. Curtis-Bennett had obligingly consented to an adjournment so that the application could be made.
