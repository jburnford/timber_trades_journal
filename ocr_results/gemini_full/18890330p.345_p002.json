L., cabinet-maker, Bournemouth. —A dividend of 20s. in the pound, with 5 per cent. interest, has been declared in the bankruptcy estate of Mr. Henry Lance Croom, of Bournemouth.\nThe statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £16,598 19s. 5d., £11,283 15s. 11d. of this being to creditors fully secured.\nThe value of the securities was, however, estimated at £17,061 10s., showing a surplus of £4,229 14s. 1d.\nThe total of debts expected to rank for dividend was £3,026 7s., but the total assets were put down at no less than £14,303 3s. 4s., showing an estimate surplus of £11,276 16s. 4d.\nAn offer was subsequently made and accepted for the payment of all the debts in full, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum.\nThis offer is now being carried out, and a motion made to a bankruptcy very satisfactory end to this case.\nHEATLEY, W., builder, Peckham, S.E.—This case, 3, Clifton Square, Peckham, was noticed last week, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Friday week before Mr. Registrar Brougham.\nThe receiving order was made on the 9th ult. upon the petition of Messrs. Harrison Brothers, timber merchants, of Camberwell-gate Street.\nWithin, an inquiry had been held, unsecured debts £1,011, fully secured £1,140, and other liabilities £1,000, making rank £150; assets estimated at £300.\nThe following were scheduled as creditors:—\nUNSECURED.\nAspinall & Ryman, Newington Butts ... £22\nBligh, Son, & Pollitt, Westmoreland-road ... £20\nBonsall & Sons, Peckham ... ... £100\nBrewer J., Ladywell, S.E. ... ... £10\nClyde Foundry Co., Upper Thames-street ... £10\nFarquharson Bros., Bishopsgate-street ... £10\nFarmer & Gregory, Plumstead ... ... £10\nForeman M., Bridge Wharf, Bishop's-road ... £10\nHoman & Rodgers, Gracechurch-street ... £10\nJones J.

S. Merton attended on behalf of the debtor, and said that his client had made a proposal at a private meeting of creditors, which was refused and he was now prepared to make.\nThere was a cash offer of 2s. 6d. to be paid 20s. in the pound, with 5 per cent. others were not in partnership with the debtor, and if they could be made to stand aside, there might be paid 20s. in the pound, and the bankruptcy be annulled.\nIn reply to Mr. Registrar, debtor said that Mr. W. W. Hutchens was connected with him in the business, and instead of advancing him money, he shared profits.\nMr. Hutchens had promised a premium of £100 when he joined him, and amounts subsequently; he thought there might be about £300.\nSome of the houses used in the business were in his name, and premises in Kinerton Road, Peckham, were simply put there for convenience.\nMr. Hutchens had no claim to the property.\nHutchens, who was present, denied the assertion of the debtor was that he was a partner, by which he received a salary of £2 per week and a half share of the profits.\nHe had instead of speculation as intended, advanced which he advanced.\nNothing was said about sharing any losses, and he had never been considered that he was the partner.\nThe chairman said that would be a matter for the trustee's consideration.\nThe debtor's bankruptcy was then passed.\nMr. Alfred Gilbert, accountant, 18, Clement's-lane, was appointed trustee, together with a committee of inspection consisting of Messrs. Bonsale, Warner (Imperial Bank), Jones, and Scarber.\nJONES, EDWARD, builder and contractor, Credenhill, Herefordshire.—The statement of affairs filed in this matter shows unsecured liabilities £566 12s. 7d., and assets as follows:—Stock in trade and furniture, cost £200, estimated to produce £255; and book debts £263 17s. 11d., doubtful and bad, £15 17s. 11d., estimated to produce 8s. 6d.; total £290 9s. 5d., less preferential claims payable in full; leaving £286 2s. 3d. has to be deducted from the unsecured claims £362 6s. 10d.; and showing a deficiency of £304 5s. 9d.\nThe following are creditors:—\nBrace John, Weobley ... ... ... £10\nGeorge M. E., Hereford ... ... ... £10\nGibbons James, Wolverhampton ... ... £10\nJennings George, London ... ... ... £10\nLloyd David, Burghill ... ... ... £10\nMorley J. H., Hereford ... ... ... £10\nNicks & Co., Gloucester ... ... ... £10\nPearce D. & Henry, Credenhill ... ... £10\nRalph, Preece, Davies & Co., Hereford ... £10\nSaunders & Co., Hereford ... ... ... £10\nStooke F. C., Hereford ... ... ... £10\nStout W. & Co., Bristol... ... ... ... £10\nWilliams R. & Co., Gloucester ... ... £10\nWorcester City & County Bank, Hereford ... £10\nMAYBURY, JOHN, builder, 174, Commercial Road, Newport, and of London and North-Western Wharf, Newport. The public examination of this debtor was held at the Town Hall, Newport (Mon.), on the 21st inst., and from the debtor's replies to questions it appears he had lost £250 by building houses in Eldon Road, and depreciated value of house property at Maindee and elsewhere had also to be considered.\nHe had no idea of the value of his stock, and did not know what it was worth as stock, and did not know what it was filed.\nHe had much as stated in his statement £616.\nIn 1886 had book debts amounting to £800, which showed he prepared a balance-sheet, but was unable to judge a surplus of £500.\nHe was amounted to at as to what his position was, and had insolvency a week before filing his petition, although he had been previously insolvent.",
