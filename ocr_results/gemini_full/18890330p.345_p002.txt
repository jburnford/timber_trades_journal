FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ADAMS, J., builder, 104, Corbyn Street, Hornsey Rise, N.—The adjourned meeting for the bankrupt's public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Giffard.
The failure occurred in November last, the liabilities being returned at £8,069, of which £1,939 were unsecured, and assets valued at £20 only.
The examination had been adjourned for further accounts, and the order having been complied with, the bankrupt was now allowed to pass.
CROOM, H. L., cabinet-maker, Bournemouth. —A dividend of 20s. in the pound, with 5 per cent. interest, has been declared in the bankruptcy estate of Mr. Henry Lance Croom, of Bournemouth.
The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £16,598 19s. 5d., £11,283 15s. 11d. of this being to creditors fully secured.
The value of the securities was, however, estimated at £17,061 10s., showing a surplus of £4,229 14s. 1d.
The total of debts expected to rank for dividend was £3,026 7s., but the total assets were put down at no less than £14,303 3s. 4s., showing an estimate surplus of £11,276 16s. 4d.
An offer was subsequently made and accepted for the payment of all the debts in full, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum.
This offer is now being carried out, and a motion made to a bankruptcy very satisfactory end to this case.
HEATLEY, W., builder, Peckham, S.E.—This case, 3, Clifton Square, Peckham, was noticed last week, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Friday week before Mr. Registrar Brougham.
The receiving order was made on the 9th ult. upon the petition of Messrs. Harrison Brothers, timber merchants, of Camberwell-gate Street.
Within, an inquiry had been held, unsecured debts £1,011, fully secured £1,140, and other liabilities £1,000, making rank £150; assets estimated at £300.

Mr. J. S. Merton attended on behalf of the debtor, and said that his client had made a proposal at a private meeting of creditors, which was refused and he was now prepared to make.
There was a cash offer of 2s. 6d. to be paid 20s. in the pound, with 5 per cent. others were not in partnership with the debtor, and if they could be made to stand aside, there might be paid 20s. in the pound, and the bankruptcy be annulled.
In reply to Mr. Registrar, debtor said that Mr. W. W. Hutchens was connected with him in the business, and instead of advancing him money, he shared profits.
Mr. Hutchens had promised a premium of £100 when he joined him, and amounts subsequently; he thought there might be about £300.
Some of the houses used in the business were in his name, and premises in Kinerton Road, Peckham, were simply put there for convenience.
Mr. Hutchens had no claim to the property.
Hutchens, who was present, denied the assertion of the debtor was that he was a partner, by which he received a salary of £2 per week and a half share of the profits.
He had instead of speculation as intended, advanced which he advanced.
Nothing was said about sharing any losses, and he had never been considered that he was the partner.
The chairman said that would be a matter for the trustee's consideration.
The debtor's bankruptcy was then passed.
Mr. Alfred Gilbert, accountant, 18, Clement's-lane, was appointed trustee, together with a committee of inspection consisting of Messrs. Bonsale, Warner (Imperial Bank), Jones, and Scarber.

MAYBURY, JOHN, builder, 174, Commercial Road, Newport, and of London and North-Western Wharf, Newport. The public examination of this debtor was held at the Town Hall, Newport (Mon.), on the 21st inst., and from the debtor's replies to questions it appears he had lost £250 by building houses in Eldon Road, and depreciated value of house property at Maindee and elsewhere had also to be considered.
He had no idea of the value of his stock, and did not know what it was worth as stock, and did not know what it was filed.
He had much as stated in his statement £616.
In 1886 had book debts amounting to £800, which showed he prepared a balance-sheet, but was unable to judge a surplus of £500.
He was amounted to at as to what his position was, and had insolvency a week before filing his petition, although he had been previously insolvent.
