OPEN CONTRACTS FOR TIMBER.
CROSSING TIMBER, &c.—For the supply of crossing timber and sleepers for the twelve months ending April 30th, 1890, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company invite tenders. Further particulars and forms of tender may be obtained on application at the Stores Department, Miles Platting, near Manchester, where parties are requested to call and examine the samples before tendering. Tenders, properly endorsed, and addressed to the directors, must be lodged with Mr. J. H. Stafford, secretary, Hunt's Bank, Manchester, by 10 a.m. on April 8th. Separate forms of tender will be provided for each contract. Parties applying are therefore requested to state the particular contract for which they propose to submit tenders.
PINE.—For the supply of about 1,000 loads of Quebec yellow pine for the Great Western Railway Company. Specification, and form of tender (upon which alone tenders will be received), may be obtained of the Storekeeper, Paddington Station, or of the Storekeeper, Swindon. Tenders, addressed to Mr. G. K. Mills, secretary, Paddington Station, London, and marked outside "Tender for Yellow Pine," will be received up to April 9th.

AUSTRALIAN TIMBER TRADE.
The following extracts are from the circulars of Melbourne brokers, dated February 20th:—
FRASER & Co.—The amount of business transacted publicly during the past four weeks has been on the same limited scale referred to in our circular of 19th ultimo. The retail trade, however, now report a slightly better demand, which should have the effect of somewhat increasing deliveries from the store yards; nevertheless, a very large quantity of Baltic deals will have to be held over, particularly as arrivals have been more numerous, especially in Oregon pine, Kauri pine, Baltic flooring, lining, and weatherboards. We look for a firmer market for these in consequence.
LORD & HUGHES.—Since our last review of 19th January, we cannot advise any activity in auction sales; the quantities offering have been large, but there has been a disinclination to purchase except for immediate requirements. We have no change to report in prices. In American shelving, importers are firm, clear pine, and ceiling prices. Oregon is firmer at last month's prices, caused by higher freights and the difficulty in procuring tonnage in ports of shipment. With firmness on the part of shippers we may fairly expect higher prices. The trade report a fair business doing from their yards, but a disinclination to purchase for more than immediate demands.
C. S. Ross & Co.—During the past four weeks there have been very few important sales. The offerings have been light, and until within the last week very little business has been done. The imports this week show a great decrease, and the quantity received for the previous four weeks, but the deliveries show no improvement, and consequently the public storage yards are heavily stocked.
That there is a slight demand for coopers' staves, but there is no demand for cabinet-makers, and men connected with the building trades at Melbourne, Victoria.
