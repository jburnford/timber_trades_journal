W., Leeds ... ... ... ... 10 10 5\n\nBROWN, HENRY JOHN, builder, The Lindens, Manor Park, Streatham.—Official details of this important failure are just to hand.\nThe statement of affairs discloses gross liabilities £48,875 12s. 9d., creditors unsecured £1,016 4s. 6d., creditors fully secured £47,859 8s. 3d., estimated value of securities £49,707 11s. 9d., to contra £1,848 3s. 6d., expected to rank £1,856 4s. 11d.\nThe assets consist of cash at bank 11s. 5d., office furniture £7 10s., and a surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured £1,848 3s. 6d., amounting in all to £1,856 4s. 11d.\nThe receiving order was made on the petition of Mr. H. Weaver, of 17, Adelaide Crescent, Brighton, the act of bankruptcy being the non-compliance of a bankruptcy notice.\nThe debtor states that he commenced business in 1864 with a capital of about £400, and that he prepared a statement of his affairs for a private meeting of his creditors, held in August, 1886, when an offer of 5s. in the pound was accepted, and subsequently paid to each creditor.\nThe debtor's furniture was sold by the sheriff in January last at the suit of a creditor, and was bought in by Mr. Cavett, of Halstead Grammar School, and given over to the debtor's wife by deed of gift.\nThe debtor states that he became aware of his insolvency in May, 1888, and attributes his present position to depreciation in property, having a large number of houses unlet, and inability to realise at the present time.\nThe Official Receiver (Mr. Cecil Mercer) in his report points out that “as the debtor shows a surplus in the hands of creditors fully secured, he gives no details of his losses, &c.\nThis surplus is, of course, subject to realisation, and at the present time I am not in possession of any information tending to show that anything like this sum will be realised from these properties.”\n\nBURNS, JAMES THORLEY, builder, 92, Rice Lane, Walton, Lancaster.—The Official Receiver has, under date March 29th, issued his observations in this case, from which it appears that the bankrupt commenced business as a builder, about twenty years ago, at Rice Lane, Walton.\nHe states that he had a capital of £500 at the time.\nAbout twelve years ago he commenced building on his own account, and since that time he has built a considerable number of houses in St. Mary's Lane, Gladstone Road, and Rice Lane, all in Walton.\nHe states that he sold some of the houses at a profit, but the remainder of the property proved to be a loss.\nThe mortgagees have taken possession of all that remained unsold.\nThe bankrupt has not kept any books of account relating to his building transactions, but although he has received between £7,000 and £8,000 on mortgages.\n\nCHAMBERLAIN, CHARLES, builder and contractor, Arundel.—The receiving order herein was made upon the debtor's own petition, filed in the Brighton Bankruptcy Court on the 11th ult., and the first meeting of creditors was held at the Norfolk Arms Hotel, Arundel, on Tuesday morning, under the presidency of Mr. A. Mackintosh (Official Receiver), when there was a large attendance of creditors.\nThe statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £1,093 1s. 4d., and an estimated surplus of £379 12s. 7d.\nThe Official Receiver in his observations said: The debtor states that he commenced business in Arundel in 1880 with a capital of £1,800, having previously carried on the business of a contractor in various parts of the country.\nIn Arundel he commenced as a brick and cement dealer, and afterwards added that of a builder and contractor on speculation.\nThe greater part of the property so built the debtor states he sold at a loss, and the remainder is mortgaged to creditors to secure advances amounting to\n\n£667 10s.\nFrom these securities the debtor estimates a surplus of £222 10s., but I can form no opinion of the value of the equities.\nThe debtor having no offer to make, it was decided to adjudicate him bankrupt, and Mr. F. G. Clark, chartered accountant, of Brighton, was appointed trustee, at such remuneration as the committee of inspection may determine, and Messrs. J. Butt, D. Page, and O. Smith were appointed as the committee of inspection.\nThe trustee's bond was fixed at £500, the premium to be paid out of the estate, and the appointment of a special manager confirmed.\nThe creditors are:—\nUNSECURED.\nGas & Light Co., Arundel ... ... ... £ s. d. ... 18 9 1\nG.

W. Daw appeared for the debtor.\nQuestioned as to his relationship with his deceased wife's estate, the debtor said it had nothing to do with him nor his debts.\nWhen he married he took possession of the stock-in-trade and furniture, the value of which he could not now state.\nOn the following day the debtor appeared for his public examination before Mr. Registrar Daw at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court, the same legal gentlemen appearing for their respective clients.\nIn reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor stated he had known for several years that he was in debt, but his friends had never pressed him.\nUltimately the examination was adjourned to the 24th inst., for the production of accounts, showing money lost in speculation, and of the disposal of the moneys of the sale and business.\n\nELIAS, WILLIAM OWEN, timber merchant and builder, 24, Abercromby Square, 284A, 286, 290, and 304, Scotland Road, 10, 102, and 104, Netherfield Road North, 195, 211, Primrose Road, and Grove Street, Bootle; and 2, Arnot Street, Walton-on-the-Hill, Lancashire.—The following statement of affairs has been filed in this important failure: —Liabilities to unsecured creditors, £8,246 10s. 11d.; to fully secured creditors, £213,446 15s. 5d.; the value of the securities being estimated at £293,355 16s. 5d.; thus showing a surplus of £79,909 1s. to be carried to contra; to partly secured creditors, £9,034 10s. 11d., the value of the securities being estimated at £6,650, thus leaving a balance of £2,384 10s. 11d. to rank against the estate for dividend; to creditors for preferential rates, £71,941 17s. 4d., of which £450 is expected to rank against the estate for dividend; total, £11,081 1s. 10d.\nAssets: Cash in hand, £288 17s.; stock-in-trade, trade fixtures, fittings, furniture, and other property, cost £3,926 10s. 1d., estimated to produce £3,926 10s. 1d.; book debts, good, £496 3s.; doubtful and bad, £1,031 4s. 10d., estimated to produce nil; and surplus from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors, £79,909 1s.; total, £84,560 11s. 1d., from which £172 18s. 7d. has to be deducted for preferential creditors payable in full, leaving net assets at £84,387 12s. 6d., and therefore showing a considerable surplus over the liabilities.\nThe following are creditors :—",
