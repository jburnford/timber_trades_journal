AUSTRALIAN TIMBER TRADE.
The following extracts are from the circular of Melbourne brokers, dated February 16th, 1889, of Messrs. & Co.—The amount of business transacted publicly during the past four weeks has been on the same limited scale recorded in our circular of 19th ultimo.
The retail trade, however, now report a slightly better demand, which should have the effect of somewhat improving deliveries from the store ground.
Nevertheless, a very large quantity of timber will have to be held over, particularly Baltic.
Arrivals have been more moderate, especially in Oregon pine, Kauri pine, Baltic flooring, lining, and weatherboards, and we look for a firmer market for these lines in consequence.

KAURI AND HUONS.—Since our last report of January, we cannot advise any activity in private sales; the quantities offering have been very large, but there has been a disinclination to purchase except for immediate requirements.
There is no change to report in prices for first-class shelving, clear pine, and ceiling, for which holders are firm holders at last month's rates.
Oregon is firmer at slightly increased rates, caused by higher freights and the difficulty of procuring tonnage in ports of shipment.
The firmness on the part of importers, who confidently expect higher prices.
The trade shows a fair business doing from their yards for immediate demands.

RED AND WHITE.—During the past four weeks there have been very few important sales, and arrivals have been light, and until within the last week very little business has been done.
The reports this week show a great decrease in the quantity received for the previous four weeks, but the deliveries show no improvement.
Consequently the public storage yards are still crowded.

EXPORTS.—Information Office states that there is a slight demand for coopers' staves, spokes, and men connected with the timber trade at Melbourne, Victoria.

BROOKE, HENRY, lately trading as Crowther & Brooke, joiner, 4, Alpha Terrace, and the Silver Cross Works, Dewsbury Road, Leeds.—The following is a summary of the statement of affairs filed by the above :— Liabilities to unsecured creditors, £182 3s. 8d.; assets, consisting of stock-in-trade and furniture, estimated to produce £34; and book debts good, 19s. 8d.; total, £34 19s. 8d.; from which £10 10s. 8d. has to be deducted for preferential claims, payable in full, leaving net assets at £24 9s. and showing a deficiency of £157 14s. 8d.
The following are creditors :—
Brown Jonas & Son, Leeds ... ... £ s. d. ... 21 11 9
Cuthbert Robert, Leeds ... ... ... 114 9 6
Smith J. W., Leeds ... ... ... ... 10 10 5

BROWN, HENRY JOHN, builder, The Lindens, Manor Park, Streatham.—Official details of this important failure are just to hand.
The statement of affairs discloses gross liabilities £48,875 12s. 9d., creditors unsecured £1,016 4s. 6d., creditors fully secured £47,859 8s. 3d., estimated value of securities £49,707 11s. 9d., to contra £1,848 3s. 6d., expected to rank £1,856 4s. 11d.
The assets consist of cash at bank 11s. 5d., office furniture £7 10s., and a surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured £1,848 3s. 6d., amounting in all to £1,856 4s. 11d.
The receiving order was made on the petition of Mr. H. Weaver, of 17, Adelaide Crescent, Brighton, the act of bankruptcy being the non-compliance of a bankruptcy notice.
The debtor states that he commenced business in 1864 with a capital of about £400, and that he prepared a statement of his affairs for a private meeting of his creditors, held in August, 1886, when an offer of 5s. in the pound was accepted, and subsequently paid to each creditor.
The debtor's furniture was sold by the sheriff in January last at the suit of a creditor, and was bought in by Mr. Cavett, of Halstead Grammar School, and given over to the debtor's wife by deed of gift.
The debtor states that he became aware of his insolvency in May, 1888, and attributes his present position to depreciation in property, having a large number of houses unlet, and inability to realise at the present time.
The Official Receiver (Mr. Cecil Mercer) in his report points out that “as the debtor shows a surplus in the hands of creditors fully secured, he gives no details of his losses, &c.
This surplus is, of course, subject to realisation, and at the present time I am not in possession of any information tending to show that anything like this sum will be realised from these properties.”

BURNS, JAMES THORLEY, builder, 92, Rice Lane, Walton, Lancaster.—The Official Receiver has, under date March 29th, issued his observations in this case, from which it appears that the bankrupt commenced business as a builder, about twenty years ago, at Rice Lane, Walton.
He states that he had a capital of £500 at the time.
About twelve years ago he commenced building on his own account, and since that time he has built a considerable number of houses in St. Mary's Lane, Gladstone Road, and Rice Lane, all in Walton.
He states that he sold some of the houses at a profit, but the remainder of the property proved to be a loss.
The mortgagees have taken possession of all that remained unsold.
The bankrupt has not kept any books of account relating to his building transactions, but although he has received between £7,000 and £8,000 on mortgages.

CHAMBERLAIN, CHARLES, builder and contractor, Arundel.—The receiving order herein was made upon the debtor's own petition, filed in the Brighton Bankruptcy Court on the 11th ult., and the first meeting of creditors was held at the Norfolk Arms Hotel, Arundel, on Tuesday morning, under the presidency of Mr. A. Mackintosh (Official Receiver), when there was a large attendance of creditors.
The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £1,093 1s. 4d., and an estimated surplus of £379 12s. 7d.
The Official Receiver in his observations said: The debtor states that he commenced business in Arundel in 1880 with a capital of £1,800, having previously carried on the business of a contractor in various parts of the country.
In Arundel he commenced as a brick and cement dealer, and afterwards added that of a builder and contractor on speculation.
The greater part of the property so built the debtor states he sold at a loss, and the remainder is mortgaged to creditors to secure advances amounting to

£667 10s.
From these securities the debtor estimates a surplus of £222 10s., but I can form no opinion of the value of the equities.
The debtor having no offer to make, it was decided to adjudicate him bankrupt, and Mr. F. G. Clark, chartered accountant, of Brighton, was appointed trustee, at such remuneration as the committee of inspection may determine, and Messrs. J. Butt, D. Page, and O. Smith were appointed as the committee of inspection.
The trustee's bond was fixed at £500, the premium to be paid out of the estate, and the appointment of a special manager confirmed.

EDWARDS, WILLIAM, builder, Exeter.—A statement of affairs filed by this debtor shows liabilities unsecured amounting to £356 0s. 10d. and a deficiency of £331 5s. 10d.
The debtor attributed his failure to bad trade, illness, and losses on speculative building.
The following is a list of the principal creditors :—

A first meeting of creditors was held before the Official Receiver (Mr. Thomas Andrew) at his office on the 27th ult., when several creditors were present.
Mr. Petherick represented the petitioning creditor, and Mr. H. W. Daw appeared for the debtor.
Questioned as to his relationship with his deceased wife's estate, the debtor said it had nothing to do with him nor his debts.
When he married he took possession of the stock-in-trade and furniture, the value of which he could not now state.
On the following day the debtor appeared for his public examination before Mr. Registrar Daw at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court, the same legal gentlemen appearing for their respective clients.
In reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor stated he had known for several years that he was in debt, but his friends had never pressed him.
Ultimately the examination was adjourned to the 24th inst., for the production of accounts, showing money lost in speculation, and of the disposal of the moneys of the sale and business.

Assets: Cash in hand, £288 17s.; stock-in-trade, trade fixtures, fittings, furniture, and other property, cost £3,926 10s. 1d., estimated to produce £3,926 10s. 1d.; book debts, good, £496 3s.; doubtful and bad, £1,031 4s. 10d., estimated to produce nil; and surplus from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors, £79,909 1s.; total, £84,560 11s. 1d., from which £172 18s. 7d. has to be deducted for preferential creditors payable in full, leaving net assets at £84,387 12s. 6d., and therefore showing a considerable surplus over the liabilities.
