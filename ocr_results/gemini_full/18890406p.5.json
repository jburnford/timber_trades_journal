  "text": "APRIL 6, 1889.]\nThe new quarter has brought a perceptible increase in the number of orders, although the demand for wood goods cannot be described as specially active for the spring season.\nThe public sale this week was held by Messrs. Mitchell Thomson & Co., at their Granton Saw-mills. The catalogue included a prime cargo of waney board pine and hardwoods from Quebec, also a parcel of sequoia or Californian redwood, and a large variety of deals, battens, floorings, linings, and sarkings. There was a good attendance of both town and country buyers, but there was a lack of competition for the waney pine, which was rather disappointing. Beginning with the large logs, half a dozen lots were sold at 2s. 9d. to 2s. 10d. per cubic foot, but this not coming up to the exposers' ideas of value, the remainder of the large wood was withdrawn. Thereafter a fair clearance was effected of the smaller timber at 9d. to 8½d. per cubic foot. For the oak 2s. 3d. was obtained, but ash did not appear to be wanted. For the sequoia, which was offered in 3 in., 4 in., and 6 in. thicknesses, and extreme widths 1s. 10d. per cubic foot was the current price. There appeared to be more demand for the Baltic than the American goods, and a considerable quantity of the different descriptions found buyers at the undernoted prices. Good lines of floorings, linings, and sarkings were also placed :—\n\nBELL & SIME,\nTimber Merchants & Saw-millers,\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of AMERICAN and BALTIC TIMBER of every description.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and White Floorings and Linings.
