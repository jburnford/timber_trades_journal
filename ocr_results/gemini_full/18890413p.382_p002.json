T., timber and wood hoop merchant, 398, Kennington Road, and Carlisle Street, S.E. — Under a receiving order made in this case on the 16th ult., accounts have now been furnished showing liabilities £1,726 13s. 8d. and assets £600 19s. 1d.\nThe debtor states that he commenced business as a timber and wood hoop merchant in January, 1886, with a capital of £100, and borrowed money about £500. In March, 1887, he took the \"Goat,\" beerhouse, at Kennington, as a weekly tenant, the stock and furniture whereat were sold for £11 11s. under a distress for rent a few days prior to the receiving order. Of the unsecured debts, £215 are stated to have been contracted for beer supplied. The debtor attributes his insolvency to his expenses having exceeded his profits, to his contract to supply hoops to a dock company, to losses by bad debts, and to losses on trading at, and by forced sale of, the beerhouse above mentioned. His books of account consist only of a ledger showing some of his customers' accounts (including also day, delivery, and wages books. He has not kept a cash-book nor been required to prepare a cash account for six months prior to the receiving order. The creditors treated as fully secured are stated to hold bills of lading for goods consigned; the book debts (good) include £320, as owing by the said dock company. A lease of 398, Kennington Road (twelve years to run), at a rental of £60, is not considered by the debtor to be of any value as an asset. The debtor has intimated his intention of submitting to his creditors at the first meeting a proposal for the payment of a composition.
