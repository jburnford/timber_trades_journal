The\ncrossing-keeper flung back the gate, seized the\nhorse's head, and stayed its progress on to the\nmetals until the trains had rushed by, thus\naverting a catastrophe.\n\nTHE GAZETTE. 403\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases\ncreditors whose names are published in these\nlists hold security for their debts, sometimes for\nthe full amount.]\nBARNS, J. T., timber and wood hoop\nmerchant, &c., 398, Kennington Road; and\nElielie Street, Lambeth.—The first meeting\nin this case was held on Tuesday before Mr.\nWreford, Assistant Receiver. The unsecured\nliabilities were returned in the statement of\naffairs at £1,726 13s. 8d., and the assets at\n£600 19s. 1d. Mr. Sydney attended on behalf\nof the debtor, and offered a composition of\n6s. 6d. in the pound, payable 3s. 6d. forthwith,\nand the balance in three months from the date\nof approval by the Court. Mr. Blanco White\nappeared for Messrs. Cooper & Sons, wood\nhoop makers, Chiddingfold, Godalming, and\nother creditors, and examined the debtor, who\nsaid that an item in the deficiency account\nof £356 represented the loss in carrying\non the business during the past three\nyears, and he had, in addition, drawn £4 a\nweek for his private expenses. In 1882 he\nsold a wood hoop business for £5,000, but he\nhad liabilities to meet of between £2,000 and\n£3,000, and when he started again in 1886 he\nhad only about £100 capital, although it was\nalleged at the private meeting recently held\nthat he had then £250. There were liabilities\nfor £150 which were not taken into account\nwhen the former statement was made. The\nChairman said the debtor's proposal showed\n£75 more than the creditors were likely\nto obtain if the estate went into bank-\nruptcy, and it was for them to consider\nas to its acceptance. On the voting being\ntaken it appeared that the proposal was not\ncarried by the necessary majority of creditors,\nand bankruptcy was the necessary alternative.\nMr. White said he would not have pressed for\nbankruptcy if the debtor could have given\nsatisfactory explanations of various matters\nthat were dealt with at the recent private\nmeeting, when a composition of 6s. 8d. in the\npound was offered and refused, upon the ground\nthat the books had not been properly made up.\nHe nominated Mr. C. J. Singleton, accountant,\nto the office of trustee. The creditors, how-\never, decided by a majority to leave the matter\nin the hands of the Official Receiver, and he\nwill, therefore, continue to act as trustee under\nthe bankruptcy.\nBARTHOLOMEW, MARY, builder and\ndecorator, 95, King's Road, Chelsea, S.W.—\nThis case was noticed last week, and the first\nmeeting of creditors was held on Tuesday\nbefore Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The\ndebtor, trading as \"M. Seal,\" returned her un-\nsecured debts at £363 7s., and assets £38\n1s. 7d., the following being the principal credi-\ntors:—\n£ s. d.\nCrappert & Co. T., Marlborough Road, Chelsea 29 16 8\nDavies & Co. J., Lowndes Terrace, S.W.... ... 70 19 6\nDruce & Co., King's Road, S.W. ... ... 14 8 7\nFenn W.

E., 259, King's Road, Chelsea ... 29 15 9\nHart F., 143, Fulham Road, S.W. ... ... 17 16 6\nKingsbury F., College Place, S.W. ... ... 30 17 1\nPackham & Co., Knightrider Street, E.C. ... 17 0 0\nRosher & Co., King's Road, Chelsea ... ... 28 13 8\nThere was no proposal, and the Official Re-\nceiver will continue to act as trustee under the\nbankruptcy.\nCHAMBERLAIN, CHARLES, builder,\nTortington, near Arundel.—At the Brighton\nBankruptcy Court on Friday week, before Mr.\nRegistrar Jennings, this debtor came up for\nhis examination. In reply to the Official\nReceiver (Mr. A. Mackintosh), debtor said in\n1881 he had about £1,000 capital, besides\nhouse property. Up to the time of the\nreceiving order he carried on the business of a\nbuilder. The Registrar said the statement of\naffairs seemed to show a surplus, and the\nOfficial Receiver said this was so. Debtor, in\nanswer to the Official Receiver, said his debts\namounted to £630, and his assets over £800.\nA difficulty with reference to some leases of\nproperty had really been the cause of his\nfailure. He had underlet some property\nwhich he had on lease, and there was a\ndispute between some parties above him. He\nsent the amount of his rent, and his cheque\nwas returned to him. He really did not\nknow whom to pay. An action was commenced,\nand he was joined as a third party, and this\nwas in reality the cause of his bank-\nruptcy. The Official Receiver said the debtor\nought not to be in bankruptcy at all. He had\ncome to the Court to get rid of his liability\nunder these leases, which liability he could\nnot get rid of in any other way. The examina-\ntion was closed.\nCUTTS, HENRY.—The first meeting of\ncreditors of Henry Cutts, of Myrtle\nVillas, Loughborough Road, West Bridgford,\nand Canal Street, Nottingham, timber",
