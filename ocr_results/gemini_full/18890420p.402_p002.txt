On Tuesday week a cart laden with timber
drawn by a horse, the property of Mr. Baker,
of Ordsall, was approaching the Ordsall
crossing over the Great Northern line, when
the animal bolted, and dashed into the gates.
One was smashed open and fouled the line.
At the same moment two trains were
approaching in opposite directions. The
crossing-keeper flung back the gate, seized the
horse's head, and stayed its progress on to the
metals until the trains had rushed by, thus
averting a catastrophe.

THE GAZETTE. 403
FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases
creditors whose names are published in these
lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for
the full amount.]
BARNS, J. T., timber and wood hoop
merchant, &c., 398, Kennington Road; and
Elielie Street, Lambeth.—The first meeting
in this case was held on Tuesday before Mr.
Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The unsecured
liabilities were returned in the statement of
affairs at £1,726 13s. 8d., and the assets at
£600 19s. 1d. Mr. Sydney attended on behalf
of the debtor, and offered a composition of
6s. 6d. in the pound, payable 3s. 6d. forthwith,
and the balance in three months from the date
of approval by the Court. Mr. Blanco White
appeared for Messrs. Cooper & Sons, wood
hoop makers, Chiddingfold, Godalming, and
other creditors, and examined the debtor, who
said that an item in the deficiency account
of £356 represented the loss in carrying
on the business during the past three
years, and he had, in addition, drawn £4 a
week for his private expenses. In 1882 he
sold a wood hoop business for £5,000, but he
had liabilities to meet of between £2,000 and
£3,000, and when he started again in 1886 he
had only about £100 capital, although it was
alleged at the private meeting recently held
that he had then £250. There were liabilities
for £150 which were not taken into account
when the former statement was made. The
Chairman said the debtor's proposal showed
£75 more than the creditors were likely
to obtain if the estate went into bank-
ruptcy, and it was for them to consider
as to its acceptance. On the voting being
taken it appeared that the proposal was not
carried by the necessary majority of creditors,
and bankruptcy was the necessary alternative.
Mr. White said he would not have pressed for
bankruptcy if the debtor could have given
satisfactory explanations of various matters
that were dealt with at the recent private
meeting, when a composition of 6s. 8d. in the
pound was offered and refused, upon the ground
that the books had not been properly made up.
He nominated Mr. C. J. Singleton, accountant,
to the office of trustee. The creditors, how-
ever, decided by a majority to leave the matter
in the hands of the Official Receiver, and he
will, therefore, continue to act as trustee under
the bankruptcy.
BARTHOLOMEW, MARY, builder and
decorator, 95, King's Road, Chelsea, S.W.—
This case was noticed last week, and the first
meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday
before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The
debtor, trading as "M. Seal," returned her un-
secured debts at £363 7s., and assets £38
1s. 7d., the following being the principal credi-
tors:—
£ s. d.
Crappert & Co. T., Marlborough Road, Chelsea 29 16 8
Davies & Co. J., Lowndes Terrace, S.W.... ... 70 19 6
Druce & Co., King's Road, S.W. ... ... 14 8 7
Fenn W. T., Markham Street, S.W. ... ... 20 6 7
Hacking C. E., 259, King's Road, Chelsea ... 29 15 9
Hart F., 143, Fulham Road, S.W. ... ... 17 16 6
Kingsbury F., College Place, S.W. ... ... 30 17 1
Packham & Co., Knightrider Street, E.C. ... 17 0 0
Rosher & Co., King's Road, Chelsea ... ... 28 13 8
There was no proposal, and the Official Re-
ceiver will continue to act as trustee under the
bankruptcy.
CHAMBERLAIN, CHARLES, builder,
Tortington, near Arundel.—At the Brighton
Bankruptcy Court on Friday week, before Mr.
Registrar Jennings, this debtor came up for
his examination. In reply to the Official
Receiver (Mr. A. Mackintosh), debtor said in
1881 he had about £1,000 capital, besides
house property. Up to the time of the
receiving order he carried on the business of a
builder. The Registrar said the statement of
affairs seemed to show a surplus, and the
Official Receiver said this was so. Debtor, in
answer to the Official Receiver, said his debts
amounted to £630, and his assets over £800.
A difficulty with reference to some leases of
property had really been the cause of his
failure. He had underlet some property
which he had on lease, and there was a
dispute between some parties above him. He
sent the amount of his rent, and his cheque
was returned to him. He really did not
know whom to pay. An action was commenced,
and he was joined as a third party, and this
was in reality the cause of his bank-
ruptcy. The Official Receiver said the debtor
ought not to be in bankruptcy at all. He had
come to the Court to get rid of his liability
under these leases, which liability he could
not get rid of in any other way. The examina-
tion was closed.
CUTTS, HENRY.—The first meeting of
creditors of Henry Cutts, of Myrtle
Villas, Loughborough Road, West Bridgford,
and Canal Street, Nottingham, timber
