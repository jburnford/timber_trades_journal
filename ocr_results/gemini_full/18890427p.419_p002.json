Mr. Hoddinott, solicitor, represented debtor, and Mr. Hicklin, a creditor, was also present. The debtor, in reply to the Official Receiver, stated that he commenced business about 1877 without capital, and carried on business down to August, 1884. Since that time he has not carried on any business, but has supported himself out of the moneys saved and the rent of his properties. He is now manager for a Mr. Preedy at a salary of £2 a week. The debtor declared that he had been the victim of persecution by creditors. The examination was adjourned until next month.\n\nKING, A. G.—At the London Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Willoughby, the adjourned public examination of Alfred George King, of 32, Millfield-road, Wandsworth Bank-road, was resumed. The bankrupt was previously examined at the court. The bankrupt said that he commenced business as a commission agent, and he remained at that nearly 18 months, earning £400 a year as his share of the business. He was in partnership with Messrs. Mayer & Wilson. He continued the business on his own account until February of last year, when he should enter their service as commercial traveller, where he remained until the business was insolvent at that time, the creditors being about £1,000, and £400 or £500 being also owing to private creditors. He handed over his assets over a cheque for £300 as part of the estate. The arrangement with the creditors was made by Mr. Foy, of Messrs. Foy, Morgan, & Co., and he was to go on paying in to the creditors until he had paid them 15s. in the pound, when he was to have his discharge. Mr. Hudson, his late employer, was a creditor at the present time for £600 for money lent, and was also the petitioning creditor. When it was proposed that he should enter the service of Messrs. Hudson he explained his financial circumstances to Mr. Hudson, telling him that he was much behindhand, and must have some money to pay his creditors. Mr. Hudson asked him how much he was owing, and he replied that the amount was £500 or £600, and Mr. Hudson then promised that he would let him have £500 with the object of clearing off his debts.\nThe Official Receiver: But you say that now the amount of your debts was £1,000.\nThe bankrupt: I thought it was about £500 or £600 at the time.\nContinuing: the bankrupt said he entered Messrs. Hudson's employment as their agent and traveller. His salary was to be £250 a year, out of which he was to pay his own \"treating\" expenses. He was also allowed £150 a year for travelling expenses, but often he had to go over being London. He remained in Messrs. Hudson's services after a short period of service, but he could not say what it was.\nMr. Hudson gave him no reason why he left.\nMr. Hudson accounted to Mr. Hudson for every penny that he had received, and, as far as he knew, Mr. Hudson had no charge at all against him.\nDuring the last three years his expenses for living and general purposes had been about £1,200 a year. In July of last year he received from Mr. Hudson the sum of £149 by threat of legal proceedings, although he owed Mr. Hudson the balance for which he had now proved, but he had every intention of paying the balance off if he had had an opportunity.\nOn Thursday Mr. King was cross-examined at some length by Mr. Rook, solicitor, who appeared for Messrs. Hudson, the petitioning creditors. In reply to that gentleman the bankrupt now denied that he said at the last examination that he owed £1,500 at the time he was engaged by Messrs. Hudson. He now did say was that his trade debts were about £700. At any rate, his trade and private debts were something over £1,000. He engaged he told Mr. Hudson that £600 or £700 would clear him from trade debts, but he was not then referring to his private debts, of which he knew he would not be asked. He told Mr. Hudson, before he entered his service, that during the three years 1885, 1886, and 1887 he had earned about £1,000 a year for commission.\nMr. Rook: Didn't you tell him you would earn him from £5,000 to £6,000 a year?\nThe bankrupt: I told him there was no commission on the transactions, and why should not he have the profit on them as well as other people?\nCross-examination continued: The bankrupt said his commission for the past three years had averaged £1,000 a year, but he did not know what his earnings were since he had entered Mr. Hudson's service.\nMr. Rook: Would you be surprised to hear they do not average more than £40 a month?\nThe bankrupt: If they did not it would be Mr. Hudson's fault.\nMr. Rook: Would you be surprised to hear that?\nThe bankrupt: I should be somewhat surprised.\nMr. Rook: You said last time that part of the £500 Mr. Hudson lent you was paid to your creditors. Was that so or not?\nThe bankrupt: Every penny of it.\nIn further cross-examination the bankrupt stated that his liabilities were increased by the realisation of his goods. He sold Messrs. Tubbs & Co. sundry goods without entering them in the order book, but he informed Mr. Hudson of that sale, and he did not think he entered any sales after the first week.\nMr. Rook: Was not an order given to Messrs. Tubbs & Co. at a price at which you knew Messrs. Hudson would lose money?\nThe bankrupt: No, it was taken at a good price at the time, but the market rose afterwards.\nMr. Rook: That you swear?\nThe bankrupt: That I swear.\nMr. Rook: Don't you know that it was on account of that order that Mr. Hudson dismissed you?\nThe bankrupt: I believe that had something to do with it, but the market had gone up.\nMr. Rook: Was there a loss on that order?\nThe bankrupt: A small loss on that order.\nMr. Rook: How much?\nThe Bankrupt: I should think perhaps £10.\nContinuing, the bankrupt said he proceeded against Mr. Hudson for the £149 owing to him, although he owed Mr. Hudson £500, because Mr. Hudson had behaved very badly to him.\nMr. Rook: Don't you think you behaved very badly to Messrs. Hudson?",
