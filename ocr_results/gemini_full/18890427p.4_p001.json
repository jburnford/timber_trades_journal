The vessel was then floated off the beech with something like half a cargo still on board, and was proceeding to Greenock in tow, when she was abandoned as described. She is reported to have drifted ashore since the abandonment at Auchnacairron on the Kirkcudbrightshire coast.\nBusiness is fairly steady, and prices quite firm. There have been no auction sales here lately nor do we expect any for some time to come. The stock of deals in first hands has been reduced to a very low point, and this fact, combined with the meagre stocks of Canadian timber, will probably delay any auction sale till near the time of new importations being due when efforts may be publicly made to clear out old balances. Deliveries from the timber ponds have been moderate. Our harbours are busy, and the timber trade contributes satisfactorily to the improved revenue of the harbour trust. We have had two arrivals during the week with pitch pine, viz., the Melmerby, from Mobile, for Wright & Breakenridge, and the Winnifred, from Port Royal, for McDowall & Neilson. There are also two cargoes of teak due any day, the vessels having left port of call.\n\nLEITH.\nThere is again a fair list of arrivals during the week, consisting chiefly of deals and battens from Namsos and Drontheim, but including also a cargo of timber from Stettin, and a consignment of walnut and poplar logs and deals by steamer from Baltimore. The largest shipment this week is the Tana (s), from Drontheim, with 33,545 deals and battens and 99 loads firewood for various importers.\nThere is no change in the state of the trade, although, owing to the fresh arrivals, there is more doing, importers being anxious to make sales from quay. The public sale this week was held by Messrs. A. Garland & Roger at their Bath Road Yard on Tuesday, 23rd inst., but the early part of the day being exceedingly wet interfered with the attendance, a very unfortunate circumstance, as there was a large and varied assortment of goods to offer. The bidding was slow throughout, but for all the better qualities the demand running chiefly on those. In particular a cargo of Drontheim goods partly sea damaged, was cleared out at 2½d. to 2¾d. per lineal foot, for 3x9 red and white deals, and 1¼d. to 1¾d. for 2½x6½ battens. These goods, seemed excellent value to buyers, but it is to be presumed that the bargain was given at the expense of the underwriters and not of the importers. A quantity of cheap Namsos deals and battens just landed ex steamer St. Olaf was also placed at 2½d. to 2¾d. for 3x9 red deals, and 1½d. to 1¾d. for 2½x6½ white battens. Some 1st quality Oregon red pine deals 3x11 were offered and fetched 6¾d. per lineal foot, but this price not being considered satisfactory, the rest of the parcel was withdrawn. Of timber in log little or nothing was sold, but some lines of floorings, linings, and sarkings were placed at similar rates to those obtained at recent auctions.\n\nSALE OF WOOD AT LETHAM.—On the 18th inst. Provost Brand, auctioneer, conducted a large sale of wood at Letham, when there were exposed 298 lots, chiefly larch and Scotch and spruce firs. There was a good attendance of buyers, and good prices, the sale being the last which has be enheld at Letham for many years.\n\nABERDEEN.—Messrs. Reith & Anderson exposed, at the Caledonian Railway Station last week, a number of ash and elm trees, the property of Mr. P. Sinclair, wood merchant, Perth, which met with a fair selling trade. Most of the wood was of large sizes and superior quality, for which prices ranged as follows:—Ash, from 1s. 10d. to 2s. 5d. per cubic foot; elm, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. per cubic foot.
