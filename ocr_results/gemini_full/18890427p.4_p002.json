This business is carried on under quite different conditions from the foreign timber trade. In many countries where wood is one of the chief exports every facility is given and precaution taken to promote the industry, while with us, it seems to be nobody's business to engender and develop our home trade. But, recently, a little more attention has been given to this subject, and lately there has been a committee appointed by the House of Commons to look into it, and see how far a remedy might be applied to prevent the denuding entirely of our country of its belts of timber and woodlands without any obligation on the part of the landlord to replant them. The timber on their estates seems to be the first thing landlords give their attention to when they require a little hard cash, but in all probability, although they replanted them, they would not reap any monetary benefit themselves; they let the lands lie waste, and they soon become swamps for want of trees to absorb the rains. It is held by many good authorities that woods are very essential for the protection of our crops from strong winds, and also for their climatic influence, as they store the rain partially and prevent flooding,\n\nBELL & SIME,\nTimber Merchants & Saw-Millers,\nDUNDEE SAW-MILLS,\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of AMERICAN and BALTIC TIMBER of every description.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and White Floorings and Linings.
