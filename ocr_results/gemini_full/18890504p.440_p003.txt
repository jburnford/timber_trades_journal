[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
AYLES, ROBERT ANDREWS, the younger, builder, Weymouth.—The statement of affairs filed by this debtor shows unsecured creditors £616, and a deficiency of £622 11s. 3d. The debtor alleges the cause of failure to be losses on building speculations. The Official Receiver's observations are :—"The debtor has consented to being adjudged bankrupt, and I have consequently made an application to the Court for an order of adjudication." The following are the creditors :—

BARNS, JAS. T., timber and wood hoop merchant, 398, Kennington Road, and Railway Arches, Carlisle Street, Lambeth.—The debtor applied on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard, to pass his examination. His statement of affairs showed liabilities £1,726, with assets £600. Mr. F. C. Sydney, solicitor, supported the application ; Mr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver; and Mr. Brown for creditors. The debtor, on being examined, said that he started in his present business in 1886, with a capital of £100 in cash, and some stock. Mr. Howell: Had you any previous experience in the timber trade? The bankrupt said he had. He afterwards borrowed money in order that he might enter into a dock contract. Mr. Howell: When did you first discover that you were insolvent? The bankrupt replied that he believed himself to be solvent up to Christmas last. Since 1886 his expenses were in excess of the profits, but he had been under the impression that he made a net profit. He had not made out any balance-sheet, and there was no bought ledger kept. He was not aware what money he owed. he did not keep a proper cash book. He had an invoice hoop book, and from that he made out a list of his creditors. He ascertained the amounts owing to them by calculating the number of hoops which he received.

When he entered into the contract with the docks he believed that he was solvent, but the contract proved the chief cause of his failure. A loss arose in connection with the cost of delivery and travelling, for which he had not allowed a sufficient margin. He had previously performed Government contracts, but not dock contracts. He was obliged to deliver the goods within a certain time, which the authorities fixed, and this led to exposure. In February last he was served with a writ, and he then consulted a solicitor and filed his petition. Mr. Brown then examined the bankrupt in reference to his transactions with Mr. Bolding and other creditors. The bankrupt went on to admit that he lost money on some parcels of goods which he sent to the dock. He said that he had refused delivery of goods from Lewis, and he denied that he had any banking account in the name of Taylor. By Mr. Sydney: At a private meeting of his creditors he offered to pay them a composition of 6s. 8d. in the pound, but they declined it, and he filed a petition in this court a week afterwards. Since the receiving order he had offered to pay 6d. in the pound over and above what the estate showed, but his creditors had declined to take it. The bankrupt had filed some additional explanatory accounts, and at the close of the evidence Mr. Registrar Giffard allowed him to pass his examination.
BARTHOLOMEW, MARK, builder and decorator, 95, King's Road, Chelsea, S.W.—This case has been previously reported in the Timber Trades Journal, and on Wednesday the bankrupt (who traded as "M. Seal") passed her public examination before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £363 7s. and assets £38 1s. 7d.
BURTON, FRANCIS CHADBURN, builder, 29½, Manning Street, and 8, Corporation Oaks, Nottingham.—The first meeting of creditors under this recent failure was held last week at the Official Receiver's offices, 1, High Pavement, Nottingham. From the Official Receiver's observations it appears that the receiving order has been made on debtor's own petition. He was adjudicated bankrupt on the 3rd ult. The debtor states he commenced business in 1870, in partnership with Mr. Thomas Vessey, as joiners and builders. This partnership was dissolved in 1876, and all liabilities in respect thereof are stated to have long since been paid. Since that time the debtor has carried on a similar business on his own account, and has been considerably engaged in building operations and contracts. The debtor is possessed of freehold and leasehold house property and building land in various parts of Nottingham, and has a fourth share of a cottage, and thirteen acres of land at Oxton. These properties, upon which he places a value of £8,221 15s. 6d., are mortgaged for £5,981 15s. 6d., and an estimated surplus of £2,240 is set down in his statement of affairs as expected to arise therefrom. A resolution was passed appointing Mr. R. Rhodes trustee of the estate, and a committee of inspection.
COCKS, CHARLES, builder, 105, Broadway, Cardiff, Glamorganshire.—The first meeting of creditors under this recent failure was held last week at the offices of the Official Receiver, 29, Queen Street, Cardiff. The debtor's statement of affairs shows liabilities expected to rank against the estate for dividend £436 16s. 10d., and assets £2,344 3s. 11d., thus showing a surplus of £1,907 7s. 1d. The debtor was not able to submit any offer to his creditors. He has been adjudicated bankrupt, and an order for summary administration was made on the 1st April. The debtor estimates a surplus of £2,248, but it is very doubtful in the present state of the property market if any surplus will be realised. He has kept a rough cash book and bought ledger, but they do not show his trading. The debtor attributes his failure to depreciation in value of house property in Cardiff, pressure from creditors, and want of capital.
EDWARDS, WILLIAM, builder, Parr Street, Exeter.—This debtor appeared at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court on Friday week, before the Registrar, for his examination. The Official Receiver said, with reference to the building operations into which the debtor entered, the debtor had been ordered to prepare an account of his transactions, and that had been supplied that morning by Mr. Gould, but it did not contain the information required. Debtor was ordered to appear before the Judge, and to prepare a list of his accounts relative to his building accounts.
FOSTER, HENRY, builder, Mutley.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor took place on Thursday week at the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar (Mr. R. G. Edmonds). Debtor, in the course of a lengthy examination, said he mortgaged the contracts of Nos. 18, 19, 20, and 21, Connaught Avenue, to Mr. Barons, to secure a total sum of £2,200, which was to be advanced as the work proceeded according to the schedule. He executed the mortgage in February, 1886, when he received only £280, but agreed to pay interest on the £2,200 from that time. He afterwards mortgaged other contracts to secure sums of £2,100, £2,900, and £3,300 by weekly advances, the interest to be paid on the total amount from the date of the first advance. The debtor was questioned at length with reference to other mortgage transactions, and in answers that the Registrar said that they must have a goods and cash account. The Registrar asked debtor how he came to incur such liabilities when he knew that for three years he knew nothing but bankruptcy was staring him in the face, and the Official Receiver said that for five years past debtor had been hopelessly insolvent. The examination was then further adjourned until June 19th, when he would be ordered to file a cash account from January 1st, 1886.

Linklater. The joint accounts showed unsecured debts £8,018, and debts fully secured £38,372; with an estimated surplus of £6,578, subject to realisation, of which the separate estate of Edgar Sage the unsecured debts were returned at £4,010, and debts fully secured £126,279, with assets at £127,411, an estimated surplus of £1,132. The bankrupts attributed their failure to inability to realise their houses, and especially to the depreciation of the Bramham Gardens property, which prevented their raising permanent mortgages thereon. Mr. Aldridge represented the Official Receiver. The bankrupt, E. Sage, stated in his examination, that he began business in London about fourteen years ago with a capital of £5,000 in money, plant, and materials. He came to London seven years since, and was then possessed of about the same amount of capital. In April, 1885, when his brother joined him, he had about £7,000, his brother joined him in the partnership. He invested in all about £10,000 in the partnership business, and the partnership assets now consisted of equities of redemption in mortgage properties. In November, 1887, after paying away the amount of £850 into the Alliance Bank, he was informed that the bank would not allow the firm to have any further advances. They practically shut them up, and they called a meeting of their creditors, and laid a statement of their affairs before them. Their creditors advised them to go on and finish their properties in the hope that they would be thereby enabled to pay all their debts in full. It was true that they subsequently incurred further debts, but they did so with the consent of the creditors. He (Mr. Sage) had been in partnership going for twelve or fifteen years out of his separate business. So far as his private affairs were concerned, the failure was caused by the failure of the partnership. In many cases the creditors were the same in both businesses. They had endeavoured, without success, to realise the surplus value on their accounts from the mortgaged property. The estimate of the surplus was founded upon a valuation made by competent surveyors. Although the accounts showed liabilities to the amount of £8,000 as incurred since November, 1887, they were chiefly in respect of renewals of bills for goods supplied prior to that date. J. W. Sage confirmed the evidence given by his partner, and the honour allowed the bankrupts to pass their examination.
