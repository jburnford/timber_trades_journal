Business is fairly active, and the deliveries from the ponds have been on a larger scale than for some weeks past. The only arrival to record this week is another cargo of teakwood, viz, the *Bersagliere*, from Moulmein, for Thomson & Gray.

LEITH.
Arrivals this week are limited to two cargoes of battens, the one from Christiania and the other from Laurvig, and a cargo of staves from Memel. The new goods are being fairly well taken up from quay, being principally of the commoner descriptions, of which the market was previously rather bare. The public sale this week was held by Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co., on Tuesday, 30th ult., at the Sands, and the chief item was a balance of waney board pine, but the catalogue also comprised some ash, walnut and wainscot planks. The attendance was not very large, but included a number of good buyers. The quality of the pine was not very attractive, but the brokers seemed disposed to meet buyers as far as possible, and a fair clearance was effected at an average price of 2s. 2d. per cubic foot. Ash fetched 1s. 6d., and the walnut was cleared out at 3s. to 5s. 5d. per cubic foot. For the wainscot planks there was no inquiry. The same brokers, thereafter, offered, for account of Messrs. A. Garland & Roger, a varied assortment of Baltic deals and battens. The demand ran chiefly on the lower qualities, and of these a considerable quantity was placed,
