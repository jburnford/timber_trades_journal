Fowlie, Turriff, was auctioneer.\n\nTHE EXPORT WOOD TRADE OF MONTROSE.\nThe four-masted ship Dundee sailed from Montrose at four on Friday morning, the 26th ult., for Sydney, with a cargo of dressed wood. The local tugs performed the towage, and no difficulty was experienced in going down the Channel. The vessel, which had a draught of 20 1/2 ft., proceeded northwards, there being a light breeze from the south-west at the time. Notwithstanding the early hour, a large number of persons witnessed the ship's departure. We are informed that of all the large ships that have left the port least trouble was experienced with the sailing of the Dundee. The Dundee passed Dunnet Head on Saturday. The full-rigged ship Kirkcudbrightshire (1,482 tons), of Glasgow, Captain Baxter, was towed round from Dundee on Tuesday morning to load a cargo for Melbourne. The full-rigged ship North (1,233 tons), of London, has been chartered to export a cargo for Melbourne. The North is presently discharging grain at Londonderry, and will be here by the end of May.\n\nTIMBER.\nOUR SUPPLIES: ITS MANUFACTURE AND INDUSTRIAL IMPORTANCE.\nBy JAMES BELL, DUNDEE.\nContinued from Scotch Supp., page 5, April 27.\nWe have also machines for the manufacture of our flooring and linings, which do their work to perfection. One of these machines is capable of turning off 1,000 yards of flooring in a ten-hour day. The making of this description of goods used to be considered the joiner's winter occupation, and it entailed upon him a considerable amount of hard labour, and usually required the assistance of a lad, in the heavier part of the work, to pull the plane, which was done by means of a rope fastened to the end of it. Notwithstanding that the joiner has not this work to fall back upon in winter, he still finds plenty of employment of a kind where his brains are called into requisition more so than his muscle.\nThe German saw or board-cutting machine is also a very valuable tool for cutting up the finer sorts of logs, such as mahogany, walnut, and wainscot. You can see how the quality of the log is turning out and so adjust your thicknesses to suit. We have often seen logs\n\nJOHN FLEMING & CO.,\nTimber Importers & Saw-millers,\nALBERT SAW-MILLS,\nALBERT QUAY, ABERDEEN.\nTelegraphic Address—\"ALBERT, ABERDEEN.\"\nLargest Stocks in the North of Baltic, American, and Fancywood Goods.\n\nJAMES JOHNSTON,\nTimber Merchant and Saw-miller,\nTHE SHORE,\nSTIRLING.\n\nSTEVENSON, HIGGINS & CO.\nCabinet & Chair Manufacturers,\nUPHOLSTERERS,\nJANEFIELD, LEITH.",
