THE EAST AND WEST INDIA DOCK COMPANY.\nMr. Justice Denman on Thursday delivered judgment in this matter. He said that it came before them upon a motion to set aside an award of Sir F. Bramwell, made in an arbitration as to a contract for the doing of certain work at Tilbury Docks. The ground of the motion seemed to be that the arbitrator had made a mistake in point of law that would entitle the Dock Company to set the award aside. The contract to do the work was made in 1882. Differences having arisen, it was referred to the arbitrator to say what was due for the work done down to the 30th June, 1884, and what was further due for work done down to the 16th July, 1884. A prolonged hearing took place before Sir Frederick Bramwell, in the course of which the company contended that he had improperly admitted evidence, and upon that ground they sought to revoke the submission to arbitration. The Court refused to accede to that, and the Court of Appeal took the same view. The House of Lords directed that the facts should be stated in a special case, and on the 3rd December, 1888, the arbitrator made his award, which was accompanied by the special case that was directed by the House of Lords. The question to be determined was whether certain work done by the contractors was to be charged according to prices in the schedule or according to other prices to be settled by the engineer. It seemed that if the Court should overrule the arbitrator in this matter they would be overruling him in point of fact, and not in point of law, and that it would, therefore, be impossible for them to say that certain excavations and brickwork were not necessarily included within the schedule of prices. The Court therefore held that it was a good award for £165,164 5s. 11d., and that the rule which had been argued must be discharged with costs.—Rule discharged.\n\nOPEN CONTRACTS FOR WOOD.\nSLEEPERS.—For the supply of 15,000 rectangular and 45,000 half-round Baltic redwood sleepers, grooved, bored, and creosoted, to be delivered and stocked on their wharf, Spencer Dock, North Wall, Dublin, for the Midland Great Western Railway (of Ireland) Company.
