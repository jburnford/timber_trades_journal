FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

ANNETT, HENRY JOHN, builder, 65, Southmoor Road, and Walton Well Road, Oxford.
—At the first meeting of creditors held under this recent failure it was decided that the debtor should be adjudicated bankrupt, and Mr. A. E. Preston, accountant, Oxford, was appointed trustee together with a committee of inspection. At the public examination held on the 2nd inst. at the County Hall, Oxford, the debtor stated in examination that he borrowed £700 of his wife in 1882, and with it commenced as a builder. He kept no other cash book but the bank book. In June, 1886, he borrowed £1,275 from Mr. Green on two houses in Polstead Road, but it was not enough to clear off his expenditure on them by about £250. In 1888 he borrowed £900 from the same gentleman on two houses in Southmoor Road, and in the same year he borrowed from Mr. Huggins £1,400 on three houses in Walton Well Road, but neither of these amounts covered the expenditure. In one part of his statement he had put down his deficiency at £190 4s. 1d., but the real deficiency, also according to the statement of affairs was £913 4s. 1d. He accounted for the difference of £700 by having lost a horse worth £40, loss on the Polstead Road houses £250, and £284 he had paid to the college for road making in Walton Well Road. The balance went in law expenses, interest, and advances. Ultimately the examination was ordered to be adjourned until the 13th proximo.

BROWN, JOHN HENRY, builder, of Lindens, Manor Park, Streatham.—This debtor came up for public examination at the Wandsworth Court. Mr. Registrar Willoughby presided, and Mr. Cecil Mercer, Official Receiver, was also in attendance. The gross liabilities amount to £48,875 12s. 9d.; creditors unsecured, £1,016 4s. 6d.; creditors fully secured, £49,707; surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured, £1,848. As the debtor shows a surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured, he has given no detailed account of his losses. Messrs. Wilson, Bristow, & Co., solicitors, represented the petitioning creditor, and Mr. Henry May another creditor. In 1886 he had paid 5s. in the pound, but now returned his properties as being worth £1,848 3s. 6d. after paying the mortgagee. He had kept no proper books of account. The total amount of mortgages was £45,920, but, not being able to dispose of the property as he had hoped to do, he had come to the ground. The property had been valued at £17,865, but was now valued at £1,848, the first amount being returned on the sum for which the properties were valued for the purposes of the mortgage. After some further examination by the Official Receiver, the examination was adjourned.

CANTY, WILLIAM HENRY, builder, Frankville, Claremont Road, Tunbridge Wells.
—The statement of affairs filed by this debtor shows unsecured creditors £1,759 1s. 5d., and a deficiency of £1,160 17s. 3d. The Official Receiver's observations are:—The receiving order was made on the 10th April, 1889, on the debtor's own petition. The debtor states that in 1886 he took over the building plant and

stock of Mr. Hughes, of Tunbridge Wells, at a valuation which amounted to £370. This amount he paid off by quarterly instalments. He has since been engaged in various contracts, some of which have resulted in a small profit, but in 1888 he made a loss of £248 on one contract through underestimating, and he has since made further losses. He has also been engaged in the restoration of Uckfield Church, the amount of the contract being £1,000. In January last, being pressed for money, he called a meeting of his principal creditors, and this contract is now being completed by a committee appointed at a meeting for the benefit of the creditors generally. The books have been well kept, but no balance-sheet has been prepared. The debtor attributes his deficiency to losses on contracts and money expended on alterations and repairs to premises, and depreciation of stock and plant. The following are the principal creditors:—

CHANNON, JOHN, of Lavender Sweep, Clapham Junction, builder.—This debtor attended last week, before Mr. Registrar Willoughby and Mr. Cecil Mercer, Official Receiver, for public examination. The gross liabilities amount to £6,969 2s. 7d., of which £1,928 11s. 7d. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend; assets, £1,379 9s., and the deficiency £549 2s. 7d. A trustee had been appointed in the matter, but, on finding that the estimate as to assets was not likely to be realised, had withdrawn. The receiving order was made at the instance of Messrs. Eastwood & Co., of Lambeth. The debtor stated that he commenced business in 1884 with a capital of £200, and he has been building at Chelverton Road, Monserrat Road, and Fanthorpe Road, Putney, and ascribes his insolvency to not being able to realise his properties. He had had two contracts with the London School Board for £200 and £400 respectively. On one he had lost, and the other he had handed over to somebody else. A statement of his affairs was prepared in October, 1888, showing liabilities £2,000, and assets £1,200, and an offer of 5s. in the pound was made, but not accepted. The debtor stated that, had he been allowed time, he would have been able to pull round. The examination was adjourned, and a further and better deficiency account was ordered to be filed.

CROSS, FREDERICK JOHN, of 11, High Street, Clapham, cabinet-maker.—This was an adjourned matter. The gross liabilities are £757 15s. 3d., assets nil, and the deficiency £557 15s. 3d. The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition, who stated that he commenced business as a cabinet-maker in 1852 without capital, but that in 1879 he had £1,000 capital. The debtor attributes his position to loss on building speculations and bad trade. After complying with the usual formalities of the Court, the debtor was allowed to pass his public examination.

CRUTTENDEN FREDERICK, late builder, St. Leonard's-on-Sea. — The first meeting under this failure was held at the London Bankruptcy Buildings on Thursday week, before Mr. A. Mackintosh, Official Receiver. The statement of affairs showed unsecured debts £2,974 and debts fully secured £122,759; with assets nil. The receiving order (as reported by the Official Receiver) was made on March 11th, on a creditor's petition, the act of bankruptcy being non-compliance with a bankruptcy notice. The debtor states that he had been in business for the last thirty years, first as a plumber and decorator, and since 1873 as a speculating builder. In that year he went into partnership with his brother and entered into large building speculations. The partnership was dissolved in 1878, when the debtor's brother took over £3,000 in property as his share of the capital, and the debtor states that he himself had £300 balance

at the bank, the business and other property. Between 1878 and 1882 heavy losses were incurred in bad debts, and the debtor then paid a composition of 7s. 6d. in the pound on debts amounting to £16,000. In 1887 the debtor executed a deed of assignment to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors, which includes the whole of the property, and the Official Receiver understands that all the creditors now scheduled, with three or four exceptions, have signed the deed. The debtor estimates in his statement of affairs a surplus of over £14,000 from the property assigned. The chairman pointed out how the matter stood, and said that as the whole of the estate was being administered under a deed of assignment there was really nothing to be done under these proceedings. He suggested that the creditors should come in under the deed. The trustee (Mr. Lavender) said that the deed had been tested some time since, and its validity established. Under the circumstances the proceedings fell through without any resolution being passed, and the chairman intimated to the Court for an order that he should be allowed to deal with the estate that he could for summary administration.

CASH, CHARLES, builder, 34, Clarence Square, Gosport.—The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held on Monday, at the offices of the Official Receiver, Queen Street, Portsea (Mr. J. C. Moberley, fully secured creditors £2,342 15s. 6d., and a deficiency of £776 1s. 3d. The debtor alleges the cause of his failure to be slackness of trade during the last twelve months, losses on contracts, want of capital, and heavy payments made under a hire purchase agreement for machinery. The Official Receiver's observations are: The debtor has come to the conclusion that he has been in business nine years as a builder at Gosport, commencing with £45. His books have been very well kept, and consist of cash book, book for contract work, day book, bought and general ledger. In February, 1888, he entered into a hiring agreement with Messrs. F. Reynolds & Co., of London, in respect of machinery and apparatus costing nearly £250, of which sum £70 now remains unpaid. Mr. W. Edmonds, accountant, Portsea, was appointed trustee.
