M'Millan & Son), which it originated, and to which, happily, it was almost entirely confined, was a two-story building over 150 ft. in length. The fire originated in the eastern end of the building. On the east the building adjoins a large three-story block of nearly 300 ft. in length, in the top of which is stored an immense stock of wood, while the second flat contains the joiners' shop, &c., and the ground flat contains the great bulk of the yard machinery. The efforts of the firemen were chiefly directed to the preservation of the buildings adjoining. Fortunately there was little wind, and what there was favoured the efforts of the firemen. In about half an hour part of the roof fell in, and by six o'clock the building and its contents were literally reduced to ashes. The damage is estimated at between £2,000 and £3,000.\n\nBELL & SIME,\nTimber Merchants & Saw-millers,\nDUNDEE SAW-MILLS,\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of AMERICAN and BALTIC TIMBER of every description.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and White Floorings and Linings.
