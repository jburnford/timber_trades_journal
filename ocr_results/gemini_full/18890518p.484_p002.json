At a meeting of the Council last week it was agreed that the Secretary be instructed to frame a petition on the subject for presentation to the Prime Minister. With the view of bringing the subject of forestry well to the fore at the Royal Agricultural Society's show at Windsor, Mr. Jacob Wilson suggested that a meeting of the English Arboricultural Society might be held in the show ground, and the Secretary was instructed to write to Mr. Clark, asking if such a meeting could be held.\n\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nALLEN, G. H., builder and contractor, 6, Hercules Buildings, Lambeth.-The debtor has filed his petition, and, upon the application of Mr. Poncione, a receiving order was made on Wednesday by Mr. Registrar Brougham. The debtor estimated his assets at about £25, in addition to some money due to him and the furniture belonged to his father. An adjudication was also made.\n\nAMBROSE, H., builder, Colchester.\n-At the Colchester Bankruptcy Court on Friday week, before Mr. Henry Goody, Registrar, Mr. Henry Ambrose, builder, of Magdalen Street, Colchester, a bankrupt, came up for his adjourned public examination. A few further questions were put to him by the Official Receiver (Mr. C. Godfrey), and the Registrar then declared the examination closed.\n\nBALL, A. H., builder, 182, Villiers Road, Willesden Lane, N.W.-The receiving order in this case was made on the 2nd ult., and the accounts now filed show unsecured debts £765 8s. 2d.; and a debt fully secured, £820; with assets, building materials, &c., £20; and estimated surplus from mortgaged property, subject to realisation, £830. The debtor states that he began business in 1882, in partnership with a brother, under the style of \"A. & J. Ball, Bros.,\" that in 1884 he was adjudged bankrupt under a petition filed by the firm, and shortly afterwards obtained a discharge. Unsecured liabilities, £1,178; estimated assets, £1,457; dividend paid, 1d. in the pound. Further, that he was subsequently in employment until January, 1888, when he recommenced business alone, with £210 capital. He attributes his present failure to his inability, from want of capital, to complete houses in the course of erection by him at Kilburn, and the consequent seizure by the mortgagees. He also states that he lost about £125 over the sale in November, 1888, of two houses which he built at Fulham. The Official Receiver reports that it is very doubtful, having regard to existing circumstances, if the estimated surplus from mortgaged property, appearing as an asset, is capable of realisation.\n\nCANTY, W. H., builder, Tunbridge Wells.-The public examination of this debtor was held at the Tunbridge Wells Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week, before Mr. Registrar Stone. It appeared that he took over the business of Mr. W. B. Hughes as a builder in 1886 (£170 was paid for stock and £220 for goodwill, and the putting of all Mr. Hughes' estate work in his way) and had to pay £370 in quarterly instalments. He had no capital whatever, and depended entirely on the profits of the business. The instalments were all paid, either in money or kind. In the cases of some of the contracts it appeared that the profits he had thought he had made he had really not made, owing to the omission to enter some of the materials. The debtor was examined in detail as to his several contracts, including Molyneux Park and work in connection with a church at Uckfield. It appeared that on the second contract there was £335 7s. 3d. due, and the debtor said he had not taken proceedings to recover this amount, because, for one thing, he had not the means, and by waiting he had hoped to get it. He suffered losses on small contracts to the extent of about £80. The Molyneux Park was for over £1,300, and on this contract he lost £200 odd. The Uckfield contract was for £1,330. He was to have 80 per cent., but he was refused the second £200, on the ground that he had to do more work, and, consequently, he was unable to pay the wages due to the workmen. He had, as a matter of fact, suffered from shortness of capital ever since he had been in business. Starting without capital, and, in the face of the expenses he had to meet, he admitted that, practically speaking, he had hardly been solvent. He had never taken stock. The bankrupt went on to explain that four of the creditors met, and, after the others had been communicated with, decided to carry on the Uckfield contract. He was appointed manager, and assigned the contract in the interests of the creditors. He expected the work would be finished next week, and he thought there would be a surplus. The debtor having been further questioned on his accounts, Mr. Cully said he had no more questions to ask, but the trustee had not yet got his certificate, and he must",
