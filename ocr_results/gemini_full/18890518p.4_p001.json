Falling has been carried on vigorously, with the result that the amount of wood placed on the market is considerably in excess of previous years. This, to a large extent, has been encouraged by the advanced prices obtainable for standing timber, owing again to the improved condition of the general trade of the country. The lots sold experienced throughout the whole season a brisk competition, which was not confined to any of the varieties, and such timber as spruce, fir, and poplar, which have for some years been a drug in the market, were freely picked up, and in many cases the prices paid have been so high that a considerably further rise must take place in the retail market to enable the purchasers to recover themselves, with reasonable profit. The landlord has, therefore, benefited. In the first place the improved position, a continuation of shipbuilding activity, and other trades, of which the prospects meantime remain favourable, should influence a sufficient rise in retail prices to yield a fair return to the merchant.\nOak has been in good request, notwithstanding the increasing imports of American timber. Good butts of medium and heavy size have improved in price, although inferior wood and small sizes are difficult to place; for medium and good sizes 2s. is readily obtainable.\nAsh of good quality is not over-plentiful, and, according to size, from 1s. 6d. to 2s. is current, while select butts command even higher prices.\nSycamore continues in good demand; ordinary-sized trees fetch from 1s. 6d. to 2s., and butts of sufficient size and quality for bowls the prices vary up to as high, in some cases, as 6s. per foot.\nSmall wood for turning—sycamore, beech,\n\nD.

Of old timber there is nothing practically left in the market.\nElm is somewhat dull, and orders to any extent are difficult to secure.\nLarch keeps brisk, but does not improve in price as much as was expected. The quantity produced and still coming forward is heavy. The advances made some time ago, however, are firmly maintained.\nScotch fir and spruce orders are plentiful for colliery purposes. Prices are firm, and a further rise is anticipated.\nSaw-mills are busy, and present prospects indicate a continuance of briskness.\n\nSALE OF GROWING WOOD.—The standing wood on St. Arnold's Hill, Glen Ogil, Kirriemuir, the property of Mr Stephen Williamson, M.P., has been sold to Mr. Henry Young, wood merchant. The trees, numbering 8,680, in three lots, consist of full-grown larch of excellent quality, upwards of seventy years old. The exact price has not transpired, but is reported to be a little under £2,000.\nSALES OF WOOD.—The sale of sawn timber at the Balvenie Steam Mills, Dufftown, took place on Saturday. There was a very large attendance, and bidding was good throughout. The best larch posts 5½ feet, sold at from 11s. 6d. to 13s. 6d. for 50; second quality, and 4½ feet lengths, from 8s. to 11s.; ¾ boarding from 6s. 6d. to 8s.; half inch boarding from 5s. to 6s. 6d.; one inch boarding from 7s. 6d. to 10s. 6d. per 100 feet; larch and oak planking also sold at fairly remunerative prices. Firewood and job lots sold at very high prices; Mr. A. S. Begg was auctioneer. A large quantity of rough and sawn timber was sold at Blelack, Logie Coldstone, on 6th inst. There was a large gathering, bidders being present from Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Aberdeen, Banchory, Ballater, &c. For all kinds of wood the sale was very brisk, and high prices were realised. Mr. James Forbes, Glenbucket, was auctioneer.\n\nTelegraph—\"Robinsons, Glasgow.\" Telephone No. 2003.\nROBINSON, DUNN & CO.,\nTimber Importers,\nPARTICK, GLASGOW.\nSawing, Planing, and Moulding Mills, Partick and Temple.\nTimber Preserving Works, Temple Siding, N.
