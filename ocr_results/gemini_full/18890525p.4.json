For in the absence of a standard, disputes constantly arising as to the mode of measurement, contract or charter-party, and law proceedings too often follow. These evils this work will obviate. The mode of measuring spars, masts, &c., is not clearly enough between buyer and seller, and it is necessary to understand what they are about, and not leave it to third parties, who may have to remunerate for short or load. The rules set down for this purpose are enumerated and described in the work, and have been in strict accordance with the regulations laid down for the guidance of the officers of H.M. Customs, and generally was admeasured by them, by which they always regulated freights, sales, duties, &c.\" — Building News.\n\n\"For the measurement of round timber this work is certainly the most accurate. By it equal justice is done to the seller and the carrier of non-squared timber by load. We recommend the 'Standard Measurer' to the trade in round timber, poles and spars, where the measurement is to be paid for.\"\n\nWILLIAM RIDLEY & SONS, PUBLISHERS,",
