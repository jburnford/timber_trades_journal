THE TIMBER TRADE OF BRISTOL.

THE following report on the timber trade of Bristol appears in the recently issued report of the Bristol Incorporated Chamber of Commerce :—
The importation of foreign timber, deals, &c., into the port of Bristol in 1888 amounted to 69,199 tons register, containing 109,061 loads. These figures prove the import of the past year to have been much the same as that of 1887. This cannot be considered a satisfactory result, seeing that the Board of Trade returns for 1888 show an increased importation of wood goods into the United Kingdom as compared with 1887 as follows :—
1888 6,321,333 loads, value £13,680,484
1887 5,509,020 „ „ £11,121,185
Increase in 1888 812,313 „ „ £2,559,299
The consumption of Bristol's import was about 2½ per cent. less than the average of the past five years, but rather better than that of 1887.
The import represented about an eighth part of the total tonnage that entered the port in the foreign trade.
1888 was anticipated with confidence by the timber trade, and will no doubt be remembered generally with satisfaction; it certainly proved a year of surprises. Opening with an unprecedented demand by importers for wood goods, prices at the various ports of shipment were accepted at the same level as the previous year; the boom soon caused advances in values, and the upward tendency continued throughout the year. In addition to the rise in the free-on-board values, freights went up by bounds, and finally resulted in an increase over the rates current in 1887 of about 50 per cent., and even as much as 80 per cent. extra was paid. During the month of December greater activity in purchasing was manifested by timber importers in this country, the colonies, and on the continent than has been known by any living sellers; operations in this direction before the 1st January advanced for 1889 further than they usually do by the end of February.
This extraordinary demand has continued up to the present time, with the result that nearly the whole of the principal Swedish productions have been contracted for at advances in values of about 20 per cent. over those current twelve months ago. Many importers who did not buy early have been obliged to treat with other importers to re-sell their purchases, paying something like 10 per cent. profit to secure their requirements. A good deal of this has been brought about by the call for certain sizes and brands for shipment to the Cape, where the mining enterprises are creating a very large demand for wood goods.
Up to the present time—March 15th—the freight market has held firm, and it appears likely to continue so, ships demanding same rates as last fall, and refusing to accept less.
Consumers will have to adapt themselves to much higher prices for this year's imports than those ruling now.
Bristol's greatest rival for imports, Cardiff, stands in the proud position of having about 12,000,000 tons combined exports and imports in 1888.
What attracts this enormous tonnage to Cardiff? Coal! Sailing vessels are rapidly being superseded by steamers, consequently there is an ever-increasing demand for coal at port of discharge; and it naturally follows the port that cannot supply this commodity must pay higher freights for imports.
In face of the fact that local coalowners will successfully compete with a large percentage of the shipments from Monmouthshire and South Wales, and, indeed, from all other British ports, it seems deplorable that nothing is done year after year to make the export of coal possible here. Bristol remains the only port having a coalfield behind it without facility for shipment.
The proposition of a colliery proprietor in the Bristol coalfield to erect an experimental tip at his own cost, at the harbour railway siding, was refused by the Great Western Railway Company, on the ground that the space was barely sufficient for their present traffic. This points to the need of an extension of Cumberland Basin, and the construction of an entrance dock at the “cabbage garden.” This subject was considered a good one as far back as 1877, and certain powers were then asked for. During the ready interval of fifteen years, the trade and commerce of the port of Bristol, by which she gets an outlet for her mineral wealth, has been allowed to slide, it may be interesting to note what other places have been doing.

The Great Western Railway Company's annual report, recently published, refers to arrangements “that have been made to provide for the increased coal traffic at Swansea, by the construction of further sidings at that place, and the erection of an additional tip at the Prince of Wales' Dock.”
The little port of Ayr, that has been known for centuries, and was the principal port on the Clyde before Glasgow had any claim to such a position, can be cited to show results that have followed the provision of coal shipping facilities elsewhere. The total tonnage that entered Ayr in 1837 amounted to 65,651 tons. In 1873 it was felt that if the trade of the port were to be retained and cultivated, powers to construct docks and provide the most modern and approved appliances must be applied for. £180,000 was borrowed, and a dock of eight acres was begun about that date and completed in 1878. Hydraulic and steam cranes, capable of loading 5,000 tons of coal per day, were erected. The tonnage inwards in 1887 was 296,593 tons, while the coal shipments in 1888 amounted to within very little of 500,000 tons, and the timber trade has grown in proportion to the advancement of other industries.
The probable effect of the working of the new Railway and Canal Traffic Act upon the timber trade of Bristol is seriously engaging the attention of the trade. As far as it can be understood at present, it certainly looks to be more favourable to the interests of the railway companies than to traders. Combined action must be taken by the timber trade all over the country to get some of the anomalies remedied. In Bristol timber merchants will look to the Chamber of Commerce for assistance in appealing against the classifications that the railway companies have put timber in, and other provisions of the Act, that are certainly prejudicial to the trade generally.
No doubt the numerous difficulties will all be satisfactorily arranged in due time, but at present the alterations have a serious disturbing influence to the general course of business.
FORESTRY is a national object in Switzerland. During 1888 as many as 5,835,000 coniferous trees were planted, besides nearly half a million of other plants.
At the Chester District Sessions William Dean, of Christleton, a contractor, was charged on remand with stealing a quantity of timber valued at £3 10s., the property of Mr. John Cullimore, a local magistrate. Prisoner had contracted to take down two houses in Brook Lane and remove the timber to Eversley Park. It was stated in evidence that he had sold a quantity of timber to a market gardener named Rose. He was committed to the quarter sessions for trial.
THE LAW AS TO THE SALE OF GOODS.—Lord Herschell has introduced a Bill for codifying the law relating to the sale of goods. It endeavours to reproduce as exactly as possible the statutory and common law rules relating to the subject, leaving for introduction at a latter stage any amendments that may seem desirable. The Bill is, however, almost entirely a reproduction of the common law; for with the exception of the statute of frauds the legislative enactments relating to the sale of goods deal only with isolated points not of much general importance. In so far as such enactments deal solely with the law of sale they have been reproduced in the Bill; but where they relate mainly to some different subject matter and deal incidentally only with the law of sale, or where they affect only certain specified classes of goods, they have been covered by saving clauses. If the whole law of contract were codified, this Bill would form a chapter in the code. In accordance with this principle no attempt is made to reproduce the effect of cases which, though arising out of sales, merely illustrate principles common to the whole law of simple contracts. The Bill does not extend to Scotland; for, since the law of Scotland with respect to the sale of goods differs in many important respects from that of England, a mere codifying Bill could not extend to both countries. The Bills of Exchange Act of 1882, on the lines of which the Bill is drawn, did not, as originally drafted, apply to Scotland; but after consultation with Scotch legal authorities it was thought desirable to lay down uniform rules for both countries, and this was effected by amendments in Committee—the Scotch rule being adopted in some cases, and in others the English. Lord Herschell suggests that possibly a similar course might be found feasible in the case of the present measure.
