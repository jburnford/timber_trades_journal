W. Riley (Alexander & Co., W. Ogden (J. Bland & Co., Limited), Smith (Morris & Smith), Robinson (Sydney Robinson & Co.), Bird (Williams, Thomas & Co.), Schroeter (Schroeter & Co.), and Castell (Tellefsen & Co.). It was then resolved:—\n1. That we object to any of the carrying companies obtaining under this Act any enlargement of their existing statutory powers or the legalisation of any charges which they have hitherto made without statutory authority, to the disadvantage of freighters.\n2. We object to the classification of schedules of those companies (a) who propose higher maximum rates and terminals than their existing rates; (b) who have omitted to supply information on these points in the form appended to the Act; (c) who have omitted to state in the form of the appendix the maximum rate per train per mile, and the maximum rate per truck per mile, or to state the \"amounts at present charged for each service,\" as required in instruction 2 of appendix. (3) We object to the proposed maximum rates for wood goods, because they are very much higher than those which have been charged for many years by railway companies that have paid good dividends to their ordinary shareholders. (4) We object to wood goods being entered in two classes. (5) We object to weight of wood goods being computed by measurement, because the practice lends itself to preferential rates on the one hand, and to false declaration of measurement on the other. We claim that wood goods should be placed in Class B for actual weight. (6) We object to wood goods being made subject to the exceptional charges proposed in Part IV. L. and N.-W. Co. schedule, and others. (7) We object to east coast maximum rates being lower than west coast.\n\nOn Friday week a meeting of the committee appointed by the Chamber of Commerce to study the new railway rates and schedules with special regard to the needs of the trades of Gloucester was held at the offices of the Chamber. The committee is composed as follows:—For timber—Messrs. W. Adams, T. Thorpe, and J. F. Hooper (Nicks & Co.); for corn—Messrs. T. B. Fox, J. Edward Turner, R. W. White, and D. Hewlett; for flour—Mr. T. W. Hibbard; for general trade—Messrs. Harley Butt, James Fielding, A. Meats, J. Stephens, A. Slater, H. Mousell, T. Summers, J. A. Matthews, and C. Holbrook.\nThe object of the meeting was to decide upon the objections which, after very exhaustive inquiries, have been formulated against the proposals of the Midland and Great Western Companies, and which will be submitted to the Board of Trade by the President (Mr. Platt) on behalf of traders throughout the entire area now covered by the Chamber.\nThe Committee in their notice of objections state in each case the ground of their opposition to the railway proposals. At the outset they oppose the new classifications, stating that they show no instance of a downward movement, \"but, on the contrary, there is evidence of the intention of the company to raise a large number of articles from the classifications in which they have voluntarily placed to higher classifications, the effect of which must be to increase the costs of the transport of these articles.\" It is urged that timber and deals should be carried by \"computed weight,\" as at present, instead of \"actual machine weight,\" and that they should be put in Class C, because they are carried in open trucks and require no special care or attention, and are of smaller value, weight for weight, than iron and steel, which are placed in Class C, and with which goods they have to compete. The Council objects to the distinction drawn between \"large towns\" and \"other places,\" as it is made the basis for a higher scale of terminal charges at the former than at the latter. Terminals are strongly opposed by the committee, and it is pointed out that station terminals are specially unfair, because they only cover expenses which are incidental to the companies' business. The committee object to relatively higher rates for\n\n515\nconveyances being charged for such short distances as 10 and 20 miles when terminal charges are authorised, and, further, that the rates as a whole are unreasonably high, if terminal charges are to be added. It is also pointed out that the Act does not provide for terminal charges in addition to the maximum rates. If station terminals are to be allowed, it is urged that the companies should be required to give full details of them. Appended to the notice of objections are tables showing a large number of articles which have been put into a higher class, and tables of rates for the carriage of grain and timber from Gloucester to a number of towns in the Midlands, showing the present and the proposed charges.\n\nA meeting of bobbin manufacturers and timber merchants, representing the North of England, met at Kendal on Saturday last to draw up objections to the maximum rates of the various railway companies, to be sent to the Board of Trade. The chair was taken by Mr. James Tyson, of Staveley, and representatives were present from Hull, Liverpool, Kendal, Stott Park, Appleby, Troutbeck Bridge, Staveley, Fell Foot, Endmoor, Eskdale, &c. The chairman pointed out that bobbin manufacturers had hitherto suffered more than any other trade in consequence of unfair railway charges. In the discussion that took place it was shown that in the transit of locally grown wood—coppice wood, &c.—railway companies charged more for hauling the timber 20 miles than the grower received for growing it 20 years. One gentleman (Mr. Howson, Appleby) said he could show that the railway company received three times as much as the grower. The price obtained for wood in Lancashire and Yorkshire was 1s. 3d. per cubic foot, and the cost of carriage, &c., was 1s., leaving 3d. for the grower and the timber merchant. One of the points insisted upon was that carriage should be by measurement instead of machine weight, as at one time of the year wood was light and at another time heavy. A memorial to the Board of Trade was agreed upon, and it was decided to work in concert with similar manufacturers in Wales and Lancashire and Yorkshire.\n\nCANADIAN STATISTICS.—The Canadian Government has resently commenced the publication of an annual statistical abstract and record, and the second volume, comprising over 500 pages, is now available. It contains statistics, down to 1887, relating to the trade, commerce, and finance of Canada, population, railways, minerals, fisheries, and many other matters connected with the dominion, and for the purpose of comparison, the figures are in many cases carried back for a considerable number of years. As the publication of this work is not generally known, we are asked to state that it may be obtained from Messrs. P. S. King and Son, Canada Building, King Street, Westminster, and from Mr. Edward Stanford, Cockspur Street, Charing Cross, London, who are acting as the agents of the Government for its sale. The price is 2s. 6d., or 3s. post free.\n\nADVANCE IN THE PRICE OF LOCOMOTIVE FUEL.—The South Yorkshire Steam Coal-owners' Association, as well as others in the same district, have agreed to increase their prices of steam coal to the railway companies on the new contracts, several of which will shortly expire. Owners in other districts raising steam coal will, no doubt, adopt the same course. Several of the last year's contracts were entered into at 6s. per ton, now the price will be at least 8s., and the advance, it is said will do little more than counterbalance the increase in the cost of the production of coal caused by the higher wages paid to the miners since last November last, and the higher charges for all kinds of colliery material, timber alone having gone up nearly 50 per cent. The railway companies will be seriously affected by the advance of from 33 to 40 per cent., seeing that in one year the London and North-Western has paid upwards of £260,000 for its locomotive fuel, the Midland £220,000, Eastern upwards of £184,000, and the North-Eastern £180,000. It is estimated that the increase in the cost of locomotive fuel to the British railway companies, if only taken at 33 per cent., will be equal at least to one million sterling for the year. House coal is not likely to be affected by the change, seeing that a large quantity of it has to be stacked during the summer months and decreases in value by exposure to the atmosphere.",
