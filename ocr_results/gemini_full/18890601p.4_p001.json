George Shadbolt & Son to take place on Tuesday next, 4th June, at Queen's Dock, Glasgow, beginning at noon; and, following it, Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co. will expose parcels of U.S. walnut, Austrian wainscot, &c.\nSales of mahogany have been of rare occurrence here, imports having been very scarce for a long time back, and a good attendance may be expected at the forthcoming auction, the cargo to be offered being well adapted for the various requirements of the trade.\nWith regretful feelings we advert to the death, which took place on 25th May, of ex-Bailie Adams, of Tradeston Saw-mills, long a familiar figure in the timber trade here, and one of its most prominent and respected members.\nThe business, with which he was close on fifty years identified, is carried on by his sons.\n\nGREENOCK.\nThe only timber arrival for the week is a cargo of pitch pine per Arecibo, from Pensacola.\nQuebec freights are a little easier.\nThe barque Trio, outward bound from here with coals, has been fixed at 26s., Quebec to Greenock, with option of United Kingdom and other ports at rates from, 27s. to 30s.\nThe barque Nicolette has been fixed at 25s. 6d. to Greenock.\nA few orders, mostly for small vessels, have been recently booked by shipbuilders here.\nAmong these we are glad to learn that Blackwood & Gordon, Port Glasgow, have contracted to build and engine for James & Alexander Allan, Glasgow, two light-draught steel screw steamers of 500 tons each, and to be propelled by triple expansion engines of fair power.\nThese steamers are intended for coasting work at the River Plate.\n\nD.

R. Millar & Sons have just chartered another large vessel to export dressed wood to Australia.\nEither of two vessels will come, but it has not been definitely fixed which.\nThe Glencairn, 1,530 tons, presently lying at Stockton, and the Glenfinart, 1,564 tons, at Hull, both belonging to Messrs. James Allan & Co., Glasgow, are the ships, and the one which will ultimately be selected will be here by June 10th.\nThe North, which is loading in the dock, will be ready to sail by the 14th June, and the enterprising exporters are anxious to have another vessel to commence to load by that time.\nThe Alacrity ss., 750 tons, of Cardiff, on a passage from Domsjo with a full cargo of battens for the same firm, while the steamer Coronilla, 845 tons, left Pensacola on Thursday with pitch pine logs.\nIt is quite a new thing this year for pitch pine to be imported in steamers,\" and the Coronilla will be the first to arrive here with such a cargo.\n\nLEITH.\nThe arrivals keep fairly steady, Namsos and Riga being the ports chiefly represented in the importations of deals and battens.\nThere is besides, however, a cargo of sawn pitch pine timber from Pensacola, just arrived for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co., being the first of the new season's shipments into Leith.\nThere is rather less doing this week owing to the interruption of the removal term, but a fairly large proportion of the new importations is going into consumption direct from quay, and prices are being well maintained for all good qualities.\nIn the absence of any public sale this week, there is nothing special to report.\n\nTelegraph—\"Robinsons, Glasgow.\" Telephone No. 2003.\nROBINSON, DUNN & CO.,\nTimber Importers,\nPARTICK, GLASGOW.\nSawing, Planing, and Moulding Mills, Partick and Temple.\nTimber Preserving Works, Partick and Temple Siding, N.
