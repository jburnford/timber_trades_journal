A petition is to be presented to the Wandsworth District Board, the local committee of which are in favour of the improvement.\n* * *\nST. LEONARD’S SAW-MILLS, CROSS STREET, LONDON, E.C.—Mr. Samuel Smither, the proprietor of these mills, informs us that the fire which took place at Cross Street was not on his premises, as has been publicly reported, but on Messrs. Waterlow & Co.’s paper stores next door, and between his mills, timber yard, and stables. Although he has sustained considerable damage to his property by water, the fire has not injured his machinery or stock of timber, and his business has, therefore, been carried on without interruption.\n* * *\nFIRE AT BIRMINGHAM.—Last week a fire was discovered at the sawmill of Mr. T. Wild, Charles Henry Street. The first story and its contents were completely burnt out, and the ground floor was damaged by both fire and water. What the fire arose from is not known, but it originated in one of the shops on the first floor, which is let off to several persons in the brass trade. Some of these people have sustained much damage by the unfortunate occurrence, and they are not, however, insured against the loss. Mr. Wild’s property, however, is insured.\n* * *\nFATAL ACCIDENT AT WELLS.—On Wednesday week an inquest was held, before Dr. Wickham, deputy-coroner, at the Golden Hart Inn, St. John’s Street, Wells, on the body of William Phipps, who had died from the effects of an accident at the brush factory of Messrs. Hillier the preceding Monday. The deceased was engaged with a man named Henry Stephens in sawing a piece of wood at the circular saw, when the saw tied the wood, and it sprang backwards and struck Phipps violently in the stomach, from which he never rallied and died the next morning, after suffering intense pain. A verdict of “Accidental death” was returned.\n* * *\nRESULT OF TENDERS.—On Wednesday, at the meeting of the Holborn Board of Guardians, the clerk (Mr. J. W. Hill) opened tenders received for the supply of firewood. Messrs. Wilson & Watson wrote that they would supply 100 to 300 fathoms of yellow deal batten ends, to arrive in London about the middle of June, at £5 16s. 6d. per cubic fathom; Messrs. Lynes Brothers offered to supply similar timber at once—“new yellow deal ends, in ordinary firewood lengths”—at £6 per fathom; Mr. G. Jewett wrote that he could deliver at once the 300 fathoms at £5 4s. 9d.; and Messrs. Hill & Record said they could execute the same order at £5 9s. 9d. On the motion of Mr. Miller, seconded by Mr. Leonard Marshall, the tender of Mr. Jewett was accepted.\n* * *\nFINED FOR ERECTING A TIMBER SHED.—Messrs. Currey & Shreeve, timber merchants, of Hardcastle Street, Lambeth, were summoned at the Lambeth Police Court, before Mr. Partridge, by Mr. Henry Jarvis, district surveyor of St. Giles’s, Camberwell, for having erected on their premises a shed-building with boarded sides, the roof being constructed of combustible material, and supported by woodwork, without having given two clear days’ notice to such surveyor, as required by the 38th and subsequent sections of the Metropolitan Building Act of 1855. After hearing the evidence given, and examining the drawings produced, his Worship held that the erection was a building within the meaning of the Act, and, therefore, ordered the defendants to pay a fine of £5 5s., and allowed 23s. costs in the case.\n* * *\nTHE AUSTRALIAN TIMBER TRADE.—Jonsiderable difficulty has been experienced up to the present time in developing the timber trade of Australia, owing to the length of time required to properly season the woods produced in the various colonies. An invention has, however, recently been the subject of experiments in Melbourne, which, if successfully carried out, will create quite a revolution in the trade, and the matter is therefore being watched with much interest. Mr. Reiser, the patentee, claims that by his system any timber can be seasoned in from eight to ten days, and the investigation that has so far been made, partly under the auspices of the Government, seems to have given general satisfaction. The new company, to be called the Australian Timber Seasoning and Parquet Manufacturing Company, Limited, is to be formed to work the patent, and the headquarters will be in Melbourne.\n\nOPEN CONTRACTS FOR WOOD.\nFIREWOOD.—For the supply of a ship’s load of about 80 cubic fathoms of best Swedish yellow deal and batten and board firewood (the latter not to exceed one-third of the whole quantity), to be delivered at Shoreham Harbour during the present season, for the Guardians. Forms of tender can be obtained at the office of Mr. Alfred Morris, clerk, Parochial Offices, Brighton, where tenders, endorsed “Tender for Firewood,” are to be delivered by 10 a.m. on June 25.\nTIMBER SEA BARRIER.—For the construction in timber of about 70 yards of sea barrier, at Filey, for Mr. Edwin Martin. Plans and specifications may be see at the office of Mr. Samuel Dyer, architect, Bridlington Quay, and quantities obtained on payment of 10s. (which will be returned on receipt of a bona fide tender), on and after 27th inst. Sealed tenders, marked “Sea Barrier,” to reach the Architect by 10 a.m. on June 5.\nCOLLIERY TIMBER.—For supply of all kinds of colliery timber, from July 1 to June 30th, 1890, for the South Hetton Coal Company, Limited. Forms of tender and specifications, with full conditions, may be obtained on application to Mr. C. Johnson, South Hetton, Sunderland. Tenders, addressed to the South Hetton Coal Company, Limited, South Hetton, Sunderland, will be received up to June 11.\n* * *\nRAILWAY CARRIAGE OF TELEGRAPH POLES —The following circular has been issued from the goods superintendent’s office of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company: “Dear Sir, —I have pleasure in informing you that an alteration in the mode of charging telegraph poles will take effect on and after June 1st next, whereby an all-round reduction will apply.
