FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BALL, H., builder. 182, Villiers Road, Willesden Junction, N.W.—This case has been already reported, and on Wednesday the bankrupt passed his public examination before Mr. Registrar Giffard. Unsecured debts £765 8s. 2d., and debts fully secured £820 ; with assets of the nominal value of £850.
BROWN, JAMES HUMPHREY, trading as Brown & Sons, cabinet-makers, house furnishers, &c., 51, 52, and 53, Lower Union Street, Torquay.—At a private meeting of creditors held herein on 22nd May it was decided that the estate should be realised. The statement of affairs submitted showed liabilities £7,533 14s. 8d., and assets amounting to the same (£7,533 14s. 8d).
COLBY, GEORGE, builder, Kirtley, Suffolk.—The summary of the statement of affairs filed by this debtor under receiving order dated 7th May shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £326 14s. 8d., and to creditors fully secured £631, with a deficiency of £288 16s. 5d. These proceedings were instituted by the debtor, upon his own petition, in consequence of two creditors having obtained judgments against him. He has never taken stock or prepared any statement of his affairs, but admits having known of his insolvency for twelve months past, and states it is due to bad trade, bad debts, heavy law expenses in connection with writs and summonses, and heavy sickness in family. No offer being made, the debtor has been adjudged bankrupt, and an order obtained for the summary administration of the estate. The following are creditors:—

HALL, E. J. B., timber and slate merchant, the Baltic Timber Yard, Hornsey Road, N.—The debtor, trading as E. J. Hall & Co., also under the style of Griffiths, Hall & Co., at 91, Finsbury Pavement, had a receiving order made against his estate on April 25th, and the accounts now filed show creditors unsecured £5,710 2s. 8d., creditors fully secured £1,015, ditto partly secured £250 (security estimated at £212 10s.), other liabilities £794 19s. 8d., of which £544 19s. 10d. are expected to rank, liabilities on bills other than debtor’s acceptances £4,798 10s. 9d., of which £712 13s. 10d. are expected to rank, total expected to rank £7,005 6s. 4d., assets estimated to realise £755 7s. 11d., leaving a deficiency of £6,249 18s. 5d.; the bad book debts amount to £3,967 1s. 3d., and the doubtful to £696 2s. 8d., and together they are estimated to realise £110 7s. The debtor (as reported by the Official Receiver) states that he commenced business as a timber merchant in 1882, with a capital of £250, under the style of “ E. J. Hall & Co.,” and that in 1886 he effected a private arrangement with his creditors, under which they were paid a composition of 4s. in the pound, and that in October, 1888, he entered into a verbal arrangement for a partnership with another person, under the style of “ Griffiths, Hall, & Co.” and opened an office in the City for the purpose of carrying on the proposed partnership business as slate merchants, but that owing to the stoppage of a firm whose failure affected the debtor’s credit the intended partner declined to proceed further with the arrangement. The debtor attributes his present insolvency chiefly to losses by bad and doubtful debts (to see list of book debts and liabilities on bills), also liabilities as guarantor and otherwise (see other liabilities), his deficiency being further explained by expenses in connection with the proposed partnership business above mentioned, and by depreciation in the value of his freehold premises, and of stock and effects as now estimated for realisation. The debtor has produced the usual books of account for his trading, but they have not been balanced ; nor has a profit and loss account or a balance-sheet been made out since March, 1887, when his affairs showed an apparent surplus of £79 3s. 6d. The “ bad ” and “ doubtful ” book debts appearing in his statement of affairs include several stated to have been contracted as far back as 1886-7, and in view of the fact that the debtor explains his present deficiency to a considerable extent by these losses, he has been required to furnish an approximate statement, showing the position of his affairs at 1st April, 1888, at which date his deficiency account, as now filed, shows an assumed

539
surplus of £187 8s. 3d., together with an amended deficiency account based thereon. The unsecured indebtedness includes £801, stated to be in respect of borrowed moneys, of which the debtor’s wife appears as a creditor for £674. The creditor is stated to hold as “ fully secured ” a mortgage on the debtor’s freehold and leasehold premises in Hornsey Road, and a policy of assurance, estimated at £1,015; and the creditor “ partly secured,” to hold an assignment of the debtor’s interest in certain house property at Woolwich. The greater part of the household furniture at the debtor’s residence is stated to belong to his wife, as having been purchased by her out of her own moneys. The following are creditors:—

HARRISON & CRABB.—On Thursday last a receiving order was made against the estates of Jabez Harrison and John Newland Crabb, trading as Harrison & Crabb, at Lancaster Road, Enfield Buildings, and residing at Lincoln Cottage, Birkbeck Road and Osborn Villa, Birkbeck Road, both Enfield, upon the debtor’s own petition, presented through Mr. J. J. Hutchison, solicitor, 1, Gresham Buildings, Basinghall Street, E.C. Assets are estimated at £400 (consisting principally of equities), and liabilities £1,700. The alleged causes of failure are excess of expenditure over income, loss on contracts, and inability to realise properties when finished.
HICKINBOTHAM, WILLIAM, builder and contractor, Park Road, Teddington.—A receiving order has been made in the Kingston Bankruptcy Court upon the petition of Messrs. S. Trickett & Sons against the estate of this debtor. The gross liabilities are £10,000, of which £2,250 is estimated to be unsecured, and assets of a considerable amount, but only a small sum is really realisable, the remainder being equities. The debtor commenced business in partnership with Thomas Hickinbotham. The causes of failure are stated to be depreciation of property and calling in of mortgage.
STEPHENSON, WILLIAM HENRY, cabinet-maker, Central Hall, Bank Buildings, Hastings.—In this case, reported last week, at the first meeting of creditors the debtor was examined by Mr. O’Neill, a creditor, who complained that the debtor ordered goods within five days of filing his petition, and, in reply, admitted that he knew he was in difficulties at that time, but did not understand that he was doing wrong by ordering the goods. Other creditors made similar complaints, and the chairman intimated that he should have to apply to the creditors for particulars of all goods sent in during the past six months. The debtor made an offer to pay a composition of 5s. in the pound, but, having no security for the payment of the money, it was not entertained by the meeting, and resolutions were carried to wind up the estate in bankruptcy, with Mr. W. D. Hardwick, 57 Gracechurch, London, as trustee, and a committee of inspection, consisting of three of the principal creditors. The public examination of the bankrupt is set down for hearing on the 3rd June at the Town Hall, Hastings.
