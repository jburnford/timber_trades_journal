4 The Timber Trades Journal

In our harbours we have only two wood cargoes discharging, viz., the steamer *Arecibo*, from Pensacola, with sawn pitch pine timber, for Singleton, Dunn, & Co., and the *Rosalind* (s) with a cargo of whitewood battens of various sizes from Sundswall, for James McLean & Co.
The revenue from the harbours is still increasing, and shows a considerable advance upon the same period of last year. We believe the next few months will show a still greater comparative increase.
Messrs. Scott & Co., shipbuilders, Greenock, have contracted to build two steamers of about 1,500 tons each, for the Messrs. Scrutton, London.
The launches for the past week include a steamer of 5,100 tons dead weight, for the P. & O. Company; a paddle steamer for the passenger service of the Caledonian Railway Company; and a steamer of 3,200 tons gross for Rickmers, Bremerhaven.
The new railway to Gourock was opened for traffic on the 1st inst., without demonstration of any kind, and we are now witnessing the keenest possible rivalry between the three competing lines for the coast traffic, which in summer is very great.

INVERNESS AND THE NORTH.
The prospects of good trade here for the coming season are favourable, and to aid this the falling freights have come in good time.
A fair amount of business is confidently looked for. The present work doing leaves little room for complaint.
In the home-grown department trade has been brisk; the great number of wind-blown Scotch fir is now almost cleared away, having been chiefly manufactured for the south country markets, and the price of this wood is beginning to make a fresh move upwards.

LEITH.
The importation of wood goods during the past week has been only moderate, the principal items being a cargo of deals and battens per *Gwent* (s), from Hommelvik, for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co.; and a parcel per *Petersburg* (s), from Cronstadt. The latter

SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.

are the first of the new season's Petersburg goods, and appear to be Gromoff's shipment.
The public sale this week was held by Mr. D. W. Beattie, on Tuesday, 4th inst., at the Edinburgh Dock. The weather was fine, and the attendance, although somewhat thin to begin with, was ultimately very good, and a fair average quantity was placed, but chiefly of the commoner descriptions. As usual, at this broker's sales, some fine parcels of high-class Petersburg redwood, deals and battens were offered, but buyers seemed disinclined to come up to brokers' limits, and consequently the quantity of those goods sold was limited. In Petersburg, Riga, and Swedish white deals and battens there was more done, and the bulk of a cargo of Riga red wood deals 9 and 8x3, partially sea-damaged, was cleared out at satisfactory prices under the circumstances, although the buyers had the best of it, getting splendid value for their money.
The following are the principal prices obtained at this sale:—
