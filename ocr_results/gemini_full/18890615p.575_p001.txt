The cargo per Felicina Antonio P, at Bangkok (957 loads), and the parcel per Karoon at Moulmein (153 loads), are not included in the above figures.
Prices remain unchanged. The deliveries at the beginning of last month showed a considerable falling off, owing no doubt to the Easter holidays. Some large business has been transacted by dealers, though at rather fine profit, in consequence of close competition. The market is now fairly well provided with stock, and the Moulmein shipments expected very shortly will make a great show; but the principal portion is allotted to forward contracts, and will leave the docks almost immediately. Two Bangkok cargoes have arrived lately, one of which is under an engagement that will take most of the cargo to fulfil, thus leaving the market in a somewhat better position than appearances would otherwise indicate. Long planks are much in demand, and stocks continue light.

IMPORTS.
[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved. Imports of mahogany, &c., appear under the heading of “Mahogany and Hardwoods” on another page, and the Scotch Imports in the “Scotch Supplement.”—ED.]
