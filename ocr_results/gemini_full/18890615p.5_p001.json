  "text": "JUNE 15 1889.] The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT. 5\n\nThe public sale this week was held by Messrs. A. Garland & Roger, on 11th inst, at the Edinburgh Dock. The weather was favourable, and there was a large attendance of buyers from the country. The goods offered at the docks consisted chiefly of a large and varied assortment of deals, battens, scantlings, and boards, recently landed from Riga and Namsos, and although the bidding was somewhat slow, a very fair clearance was effected, the exposers being able to meet buyers' views as regards price with the lower qualities of the Namsos shipments. The demand appeared to run upon those cheaper goods, and, as already said, a considerable quantity of same found buyers. For the better qualities prices were well maintained, but the quantity disposed of was somewhat restricted. The sale concluded at the Bath Road Yard, a number of balances of log timber, including yellow pine, walnut, elm, and butternut, being cleared out. Some home timber, consisting of oak, and ash, was also offered, but only the oak and beech found buyers.\n\nGAZETTE\nMEETINGS.\nBRISBANE JAMES, wood merchant. Stobcross Street, Glasgow.
