Gebbie & Roger Tuesday 9th\n\nNew rolling stock and plant works are about to be established at Motherwell, on a site adjoining Messrs. Colville's steel works. Messrs. Hurst, Nelson, & Co., Glasgow, have feued ten acres from the estate of Lord Hamilton of Dalzell, and provision is made that other five acres may be taken if required. The works are for the manufacture of railway waggons, wheels and axles, springs, iron and brass castings, forgings, and general iron work. The principal building is to be 250 ft. square, and the roof, which is to be curved, will be carried in five spans of 43 ft. each, supported on columns specially designed for carrying shafting. There is also to be an iron foundry, a forge, and a brass foundry in connection with the works, and these buildings are to be of brick. Machinery and plant have been contracted for with makers in Glasgow, Johnstone, Manchester, and Leeds. Wrought iron wheel centres and other forgings will be manufactured by hydraulic machinery of 1,200 tons power, and the plant will be used for railway work at home; but it is hoped that much of the large Indian and South American contracts which go to England at present will be secured by the new firm. The machinery is to be worked by two horizontal engines, supplied with steam from two Lancashire boilers. The length of railway sidings in the works will be nearly a mile, and they will be in connection with the Caledonian system.\n\nNAIRN.—Considerable activity prevails at present in the home timber trade of this district, and large quantities of wood have been cut during the past few months in this district. There is a demand in the south for pit props, and during last month some eight cargoes were shipped from Nairn Harbour. Further quantities are being got ready for shipment, and the local saw-mills are well employed. Mr. Barron has been cutting some magnificent wind-blown trees from the Kinsteaty estate for Mr. H. Mackintosh has a considerable amount of timber from Lethen, and Mr. Wylie, Ardersier, is cutting extensively in the Coulmony woods. Mr. Wyllie, Ardersier, has also exported several cargoes of pit props from this neighbourhood.\n\nTHE STRIKES OF SEAMEN.—Our Glasgow correspondent telegraphs that, although the strike among the seamen and firemen continues and the men are daily leaving their ships on notice expires, yet the owners seem to be able to get men to man the vessels, and, with one or two exceptions, all the steamers have got away on their regular run. Indeed, it is said that some of the vessels are manned by union men who are dissatisfied with being brought out on strike at the present time. The seamen at Leith continue, and several steamers are laid up owing to the inability to obtain hands.\n\nBUCHANAN & FREW,\nTIMBER MERCHANTS & SAW-MILLERS,\nALBERT SAW-MILLS, RENFREW.\nLarge Stock of Mahogany, Walnut, Wainscot, Oak, Ash, Birch, Cypress, Pine, &c., in Logs and Boards.\n\nFERGUSON, DAVIDSON & CO.,\n133, PRINCES' STREET, EDINBURGH,\n141, ST.
