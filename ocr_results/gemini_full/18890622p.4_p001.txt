4 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.

LEITH.
The arrivals of wood goods this week have been confined to two cargoes battens from Tyr-Figoholm and one from Namsos, a very small importation at this season of the year. The trade continues steady, but not very active, buyers still holding back from purchasing freely in the hope that when the fresh shipments from the Baltic come to hand in large quantities they will be able to extort some concession in price, notwithstanding the enhanced cost to importers of those goods.
Mr. D. W. Beattie held a public sale on Tuesday, 18th inst., at which he offered the recent importation of Quebec timber and deals per steamer Barcelona. This being the first of the new season's shipments from Quebec, considerable interest was manifested in the sale, and besides the usual town and country buyers there were representatives of the trade from some of the other east coast ports. Notwithstanding this, and the excellent quality of the shipment, the broker experienced considerable difficulty in getting the price of the waney board pine up to the level of price required for the new season's importations, but eventually he succeeded, and for what was sold 2s. 7d. to 3s. per cubic foot was obtained, the average price being 2s. 9d. for an average girth of 20 in. For the ash there was little inquiry, and part was withdrawn, but the birch sold well, being entirely cleared out at 1s. 9d. to 2s. per cubic foot, averaging 1s. 10½d. A large quantity of yellow pine deals by the same steamer was also offered, but of the 1st quality very little was sold, the demand being entirely on the lower qualities. Of both 3rds and 4ths a fair line was sold at 1s. 4d. for the former and 1s. to 1s. 1d. for the latter. Thereafter a variety of Baltic deals and battens were exposed by the same broker, and the prices obtained were much the same as at recent auctions.

THE SEAMEN'S STRIKE.—There are signs that the seamen's strike on the Clyde is nearing an end. A number of the regular trading steamers are now obtaining seamen and firemen at the old rate, and in some instances labourers are asking to be taken back. Besides this, the Allan line and several others have, it is reported, got men to meet all their requirements. The strikers, on the other hand, still express themselves confident of success. An attempt is being made to get the carters to join the movement, and a memorial has been sent to the employers by the Amalgamated Carters' Society asking for shorter hours and increased pay.
