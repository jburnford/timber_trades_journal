SERIOUS FIRE IN PERTH.
ESTIMATED DAMAGE £2,500.
On Sunday, 16th June, a conflagration of a serious nature took place in Perth, by which damage to the extent of from £2,000 to £2,500 was caused. Just as the churches had been filled with their congregations, a dense smoke was seen proceeding from the fish-curing yard in Foundry Lane occupied by Mr. William Harper, and the alarm had scarcely been given when flames began to appear at various points in the structure, which was constructed mainly of wood. The adjoining woodyard of Messrs. Strang & M'Lagan, joiners, in which large quantities of valuable wood were stored, soon caught fire, the flames in a few minutes spreading beyond this to the yard of Messrs. J. Mackay & Son, plasterers, and Messrs. Brown & Duncan's mason yard. The fire brigade, under Captain Masterson, and the county fire brigade, under Captain James M'Leish, were speedily on the scene, and did all in their power to prevent the flames getting hold of the engineer shop of Mr. George Chrystal, which flanked the burning mass on the right. In the rear of the joiner's yard is a large four-storied house, occupied by a dozen to fifteen families. It is separated only by a narrow passage, and, as the heat of the flames was melting the panes of glass in the windows, the inhabitants became panic-stricken, and partly removed their furniture to an adjacent green. At this stage a detachment of the 42nd Highlanders, seeing the conflagration from the barracks, turned out with their fire-engine, while the soldiers were hastily summoned from St. Paul's Church to aid in the work of extinguishing the fire, which had by this time assumed the most alarming proportions. News of the fire having spread, the congregations in several of the churches left for the scene, round which thousands of people were assembled. Considerable difficulty was experienced in getting a sufficient supply of water to rise the height of the burning buildings, and the adjacent engineer shop and the engineering department of the Messrs. Pullar's large dyeing establishment were placed in the utmost jeopardy. Messrs. Pullar's volunteer fire brigade had meanwhile turned out, and by the united efforts of the brigades the fire was confined to the area in which it had originated. The whole of the premises occupied by Mr. William Harper, fish curer; Messrs. Strang & M'Lagan, joiners; Messrs. J. Mackay & Son, plasterers; and Messrs. Brown & Duncan, masons, have been razed to the ground. The total loss is estimated at from £2,000 to £2,500, and is mostly covered by insurance.
THE Emperor of Japan has just taken possession of a magnificent new palace built for him at Tokio. The style is a curious mixture of modern European and ancient Japanese architecture, but the interior is wholly arranged in European manner. The architect is a native, and the cost of the building and fittings is £800,000. Nearly all the furniture has been manufactured in Germany.
IT is interesting to note that the north-eastern ports shipped during last month 88,000 tons more coal than in May last year, and the Wear and Tyne ports show an increase in the quantity sent to foreign ports. Of goods other than coal and coke, the Tyne and Wear and Stockton had decreased exports, but West Hartlepool and Middlesbrough had increases.
