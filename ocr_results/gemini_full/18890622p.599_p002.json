MATTHEW GEORGE FREEBODY.—The will of Mr. Matthew George Freebody, late of 24, Old Broad-street, timber merchant, who died on May 26th at Lucerne, was proved on June 6th by Mrs. Jane Freebody, Tilleard and Mr. John Tilleard, both of 4, Lombard Court, and Mr. John Alexnder Freeman, both of the executors, the value of the personal estate being sworn to exceed £50,000. The testator gives £10,000 to his son, Percy George Freebody; 1,000 to his friend, Mr. Richard Sparkes, an annuity of £300 to his sister, Miss Fanny Jane Freebody, for life, or until she shall marry; and an annuity of £200 to Mrs. Henrietta Knight, for life, and then to her daughter, Lousia Knight, so long as she remains spinster. The residue of his real and personal estate he leaves upon trust for his son. If his clerks, George Matthew Hughes and John William Reeves, or either of them, are in his employ at the time of his decease he directs his executors to advance them £10,000 for the purpose of carrying on his business with the condition that his son is to have the option when he attains 21 of entering into the partnership.—City Press.\n\nJUNE 22, 1889.]\nPRACTICAL QUESTIONS.\nEngine and Machine under Hire.—Can you inform me if a landlord can seize goods under a hire agreement?—C.\nGraduated Stroke Mortising Machine. —Are you in favour of above machine for general purposes, and what are the points for and against it?—A. S. F. (L.)\nImitation of Botany Bay Wood.—Can you favour me with a good recipe for imitating Botany Bay wood, and also for making marine glue?—CABINET.\nDressing for Leather Belts.—Will you or any of your readers favour me through “Practical Notes” with a good recipe for making belts bite and grip the pulleys, using either a belt dressing or other means?—FOREMAN.\nBlind Rebating and Grooving Machine.—What form of machine would you recommend as the best for the above purpose? —BLIND MAKERS.\nBelts Running off Pulleys.—What is the best remedy for the above, as I find that the or wearing the edge of the belts very much, and add to their longevity by putting on a dressing after finishing work?—S. J.\nWide Panel Planer for Two Belts.—I have a panel planer to plane up to 36 in. wide. It was made by a well-known maker some years ago, but the work turned out has never been entirely satisfactory. It is driven by one belt, but I have been thinking I might drive with two, one on each side of the machine. Do you think this would be like to improve matters?—T. J. CROSS.\nANSWERS.\nWood for Cameras, &c.—Messrs. J. Pickles & Son, Royd Iron Works, Hebden Bridge, via Manchester, inform us that they have supplied complete plants of machinery for this work, and that they will be pleased to give our correspondent full particulars.\nTurning Handles for Hay Rakes, &c.—In reply to “Devon,” for turning the above in quantities, we would recommend you to use a gauge lathe. These are now to be had of very advanced construction, and are made self-centering and self-discharging. We should advise you to have one fitted with a guard on the cutter-head, so that you can regulate the thickness of the shaving being taken by the finishing cutter; this also prevents the knives running in and digging into the stick. If this is attended to properly the lathe should very soon pay for itself. A first-class machine should turn out 1,000 hoe handles per day of ten hours.\nBelt Holders.—In reply to “Engineer,” belt holders are used to a considerable extent in America, but very little, so far, in this country. The object of the holder is, of course, to effect an economy in belts, as when a belt is thrown off from its driving pulley it rests still, and therefore the wear on the belt is saved, and also the necessity of loose or idle pullies. The belt being thus allowed to rest, it is relieved from tension, and has time to recover its normal condition. We are not aware that they are made in this country, but perhaps some of our readers may be able to give you the desired information.\nSpeed of Circular Saw, &c.—In reply to L.P.C., your 36 in. circular saw, if you make 1,000 revolutions per minute, allowing for slip, will give about 9,000 ft. per minute at the points of the teeth, which may be taken as the standard speed for ripping hard or medium woods. To find the circumference of your saw: multiply its diameter by 22 and divide by 7. We can send you a book on planning saw matters from this office.\nTaper Planing.—In reply to “Joiner,” the best and cheapest machine for taper planing newels, balusters, &c., with which we are acquainted is a wood-worker with rising table tables. For tapering purposes the front table is lowered to bring the desired taper in line with the back table. If it cannot be done at one operation, it may be divided and done at two or three times. You would find a woodworker very useful also for planing.",
