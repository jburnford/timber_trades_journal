  "text": "as yet, of a settlement being arrived at.\nIn the interests of all parties it is much to be desired that this dispute should terminate before entering on a new period of struggle after the holiday season.\nOne vessel from Quebec represents all the timber arrivals for the week, viz., the *Arizona*, whose cargo is partly for Singleton, Dunn, & Co., and partly for Wylie, Stewart, & Marshall.\nA good many timber cargoes are due and on passage, including three cargoes of the usual Quebec assortment, also pitch pine, teakwood, &c.\nWe look forward to our harbours being very busy with wood goods at an early date.\nAs it is, our harbours are well occupied with general arrivals, and a new departure has been made in securing two transatlantic steamers of the State Line for discharge and loading in the James Watt Dock.\nThese steamers have been brought here in consequence of the harbour labourers' strike at Glasgow.\nWe are hoping it is the beginning of a new traffic, as this dock possesses every convenience and facility for the accommodation and speedy despatch of the very largest vessels; and new developments are what we require here.\nNew shipbuilding contracts have been rather scarce of late, but we learn Messrs.\nDunlop, Port Glasgow, have arranged to build and engine a steamer for foreign owners.\nMessrs. A. & J. Faill, contractors, are now busy with the construction of the tramway line between here and Port Glasgow, and negotiations are in progress for the acquisition of suitable premises for the erection of stables to accommodate the horses that will be required to work it.\n\nLEITH.\nThere has been a considerably larger importation of wood goods during the past week, the arrivals including some important shipments, notably the *Gessner*, from Pascagoula, with cargo pitch pine for Messrs. A.\nGarland & Roger, and the *Avlona* (s), from Montreal, with birch, ash, and maple, also pine deals for Messrs. James Duncan & Co.\nThe other arrivals consist of deals and battens, with some parcels of lathwood and firewood.\n\nJOHN MITCHELL & CO.,\nTIMBER MERCHANTS AND SAW-MILLERS,\nLEITH WALK SAW-MILLS, LEITH.\nImporters of American and Baltic Timber of every description.\nTelegraphic Address—\"MITCHELL,\" LEITH.
