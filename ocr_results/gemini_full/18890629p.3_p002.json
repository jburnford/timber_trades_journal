The company disputed liability on the ground that the accident did not fulfill the requirements of a clause in the policy to the effect that permanent partial disablement implies the loss of one hand, or the complete and irrecoverable loss of sight, but in view of a decision by the Judges of the Second Division they have settled purser's claim.\n\nTelegraph—\"Robinsons, Glasgow.\" Telephone No. 2003.\nROBINSON, DUNN & CO.,\nTimber Importers,\nPARTICK, GLASGOW.\nSawing, Planing, and Moulding Mills, Partick and Temple\nTimber Preserving Works,\nTemple Siding, N.

At that period, with the exception of a few circular saws in various parts of the country, the sawing branch of the building trade was entirely in the hands of pit sawyers. These being frequently unsteady, builders were often put to great trouble and inconvenience in getting their work carried forward. Strikes were common amongst them, and during one of these Mr. McLean, who had been contemplating the utility of having vertical machines to do the work, determined to set about the construction of a saw-mill.\nAbout this same period Mr. McDowall, of Johnstone, the well-known engineer, was studying how to improve this branch of his engineering business. The result of their combined efforts was shown by the building and equipment of the mills in Main Street, at the foot of Station Street, known as the West Mill. The pit sawyers offered all kinds of annoyance, and employed very unscrupulous tactics in order, if possible, to thwart and frustrate Mr. McLean's plans. Endowed with indomitable energy and tenacity of purpose, he gradually overcame all these, and, assisted by Mr. McDowall, his practical experience in the timber trade enabled him to introduce many improvements, which have since been generally adopted.\n\nBEATTIE,\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and White Wainscot Flooring, and Pitch Pine, Greenheart, and all kinds of Timber.\n\nTelegraphic Address—\n\"PATON,\" AYR.\nJAMES DONALDSON & SON,\nTimber Merchants,\nTAYPORT.
