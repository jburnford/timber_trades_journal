FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, the full amount.]
ADAMS, E. T., builder, 2, Clifton-terrace, Tollington Park, N.-The receiving order in this case was made on the 6th inst. on the petition of Eastwood & Co., Limited. The first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The act of bankruptcy alleged was the departure of the debtor from his dwelling-house on or about the 13th March with intent to defeat or delay his creditors, and he now failed to appear. The proceedings were of a formal character, as no proofs were tendered, and it was stated that an adjudication of bankruptcy had already been made. No resolution was passed, and the matter remained in the hands of the Official Receiver as trustee.
ALLEN, H. G., builder and contractor, Hercules Buildings, Lambeth.-This failure has been already reported, and the bankrupt attended his public examination on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard. Unsecured liabilities, ¬£568 15s. 4d., and debts fully secured, ¬£10,346 12s.; assets estimated at ¬£1,300.
BURTON, FRANCIS CHARLES, builder, 29¬Ω, Manning Street and 8, Woodboro' Oaks, Nottingham.-This was the public examination of this debtor, who was represented by Mr. W. W. Lucas. In reply to questions, the debtor said he was not aware many of the payments mentioned in the accounts which had been filed were not voted for in any way, and the amount of ¬£916 which was down as estimated balance arising from the sale of property, but he was unable to give any further particulars than those already given. He contended that he was solvent, the statement showing an estimated surplus from the sale of property. If trade were good in Nottingham, the property would realise the amount. He lived in a house which was valued at ¬£1,650, and he considered he was justified in occupying it. He had commenced to borrow money about four years ago; had taken certain bills to moneylenders in Nottingham to get discounted, and one time he was financed by Mr. Evans. He borrowed ¬£100 from Mrs. Hannah Burton in September last year. There was a further sum of ¬£70 advanced in November. No security was given to Mrs. Hannah Burton at the time the advance was made, but there was a verbal understanding that there was to be a mortgage of certain property, which he instructed his solicitor to prepare. It was carried out in February. The receiving order was made on April 3rd. Mr. Barlow, who represented the trustee, said that the account which the debtor had furnished, as ordered at his private examination, was very unsatisfactory. He did not see that anything would be gained by leaving the matter open, and, after the case had been further examined, he was allowed to pass his examination.
