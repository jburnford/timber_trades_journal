T., builder, 2, Osborne Grove, Tollington Park, N.—The receiving order in this case was made on the 6th inst., upon the petition of Eastwood & Co., Limited, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The act of bankruptcy alleged was the departure of the debtor from his dwelling-house on or about the 13th March with intent to defeat or delay his creditors, and he now failed to attend the proceedings were of a formal character, as no proofs were tendered, and the chairman stated that an adjudication of bankruptcy had already been made. No resolution was passed, and the matter remained in the hands of the Official Receiver as trustee.\nALLEN, H. G., builder and contractor, Hercules Buildings, Lambeth.—This case has been already reported, and the bankrupt passed his public examination on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. Unsecured debts £869 15s. 4d., and debts fully secured £10,946 12s.; assets estimated at £144 3s. 10d.\nBURTON, FRANCIS CHADBURN, builder, 29½, Manning Street and 8, Corporation Oaks, Nottingham.—This was the adjourned examination of this debtor, who was represented by Mr. W. W. Lucas. In answer to questions, the debtor said he was aware that many of the payments mentioned in the account which had been filed were not vouched for in any way, and the amount of £916 12s. was set down as estimated balance arising from the sale of property, but he was unable to give any further particulars than those already given. He contended that he was solvent, the statement showing an estimated surplus from the sale of property. If trade were right in Nottingham, the property would realise the amount. He lived in a house which had been valued at £1,650, and he considered himself justified in occupying a house of that sort. Some years ago; had taken certain bills to moneylenders in Nottingham to get discounted. At one time he was financed by Mr. Everall. He borrowed £100 from Mrs. Hannah Burton in September last year. There was a further sum of £70 advanced in November. No security was given to Mrs. Hannah Burton at the time the advance was made, but there was a distinct understanding that there was to be a mortgage of certain property, which he instructed Mr. Everall to prepare. It was carried out last February. The receiving order was made on April 3rd. Mr. Barlow, who represented the trustee, said that the account which the debtor had furnished, as ordered at his previous examination, was very unsatisfactory, but he did not see that anything would be gained by leaving the matter open, and, after the debtor had been further examined, he was allowed to pass his examination.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nFOSTER, HENRY, builder, Plymouth.—At the last sitting of the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court the Official Receiver asked for a further adjournment for a week, as debtor had not completed the preparation of his accounts. It was not for the want of trying, because he (Mr. Greenway) knew he had devoted a great deal of attention to the matter. Mr. Ashford, for the debtor, said there were solicitors' and tradesmen's accounts he could not get in. The Registrar said his experience was that where accounts were not kept for some reason, either from a dread of facing the position in which a man found himself placed, or for some reason more serious. He would adjourn the examination until July 10th, and the accounts must be filed a week beforehand.\nGAILLARD, J.C., builder, &c., Prince's Court, Whitcomb Street, Pall Mall East.—Under a receiving order made in this case on the 24th ult., accounts have now been filed showing unsecured debts £1,215 1s. 9d., and debts fully secured £947; with an estimated surplus in assets, subject to realisation, of £139 18s. 3d. The debtor states that he commenced as a wine merchant in 1882 with a capital of £209, and in March, 1886, finding the business was unprofitable, he gave it up, and commenced building a restaurant at Prince's Court, Whitcomb Street, which he opened in February last. Further, that in November last he commenced building a house at 41, Whitcomb Street. The debtor attributes his failure to the non-success of the restaurant built by him, and to his inability through want of capital to complete the house at 41, Whitcomb Street.\nHATT, RICHARD, builder, 61, Pellerin Road, Stoke Newington, N.—The first meeting of creditors in this case was held last week before Mr. Brougham, Assistant Receiver. The debts were stated in the accounts at £890 12s. 6d., and the assets at £75 6s. 1d., the following being the principal creditors :—\n... £ s. d.\nBishop J., Pritchard Road, Hackney Road ... 10 0 0\nBarltrop E., Chapel End, Walthamstow ... 20 0 0\nBattershall —, Sandringham Road, E. ... 20 0 0\nCollins E., Grosvenor Street, S.W. ... 10 10 0\nCastle C., Clifton Road, Clapton Park ... 10 0 0\nCreekford & Bailey, Basinghall Street ... 120 0 0\nChappell —, Mount Street, Whitechapel ... 10 0 0\nErthridge —, Bethnal Green Road ... 14 0 0\nFarmiloe T. & W., Rochester Row, S.W. ... 27 0 0\nGoodwin & Co., 72, Bishopsgate Street, E.C. ... 63 0 0\nGingell & Co., Whitechapel ... 30 0 0\nHogben G.

Farmiloe) alleged that the bankrupt had obtained credit from that firm upon the distinct understanding that he would pay their account as soon as he drew money from his own customers, but he had broken his promise. Replying to Mr. Collins, the bankrupt said he had been connected with Mr. Pereira, whose affairs were also in bankruptcy. There was no partnership between them, but he was induced to sign a building agreement on their joint account, with the result that he (Hatt) had been pressed for goods sold to Pereira. He denied that he or his wife were in possession of expensive jewellry, as they could not indulge in such luxuries. The Chairman said that £64 had been received, and that appeared to be the only asset. No resolution was passed, and the matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver.\nMETIVIER, J. J., timber merchant, 104, King Street, Hammersmith, and Chiswick, W.—The debtor has filed his petition, and upon the application of Messrs. Lewis and Churchman, a receiving order was made last week by Mr. Registrar Linklater. The assets are stated to comprise stock of the value of £150, and book debts £500. The liabilities were not given.\nRUNDLE, PHILIP, wheelwright, Plympton St. Mary.—At the last sitting of the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court, last week, before Mr. Registrar E. G. Edmonds, M. F. W. Skardon appeared for the creditors, and Mr. F. O. Lane for debtor. The Official Receiver (Mr. Greenway) stated that the debtor had failed to comply with the order of the Court to prepare a proper account, and he asked that the case might be adjourned before the judge. Mr. Watts said that debtor did not seem to have made any attempt to comply with the order. The account filed was simply trifling with the Court. The Official Receiver read a letter from a Mrs. Lukey, formerly a Miss Gendell, stating that before she was married she lent the debtor £20. There was a further sum of £5, but although she had written him several letters she had received no reply. In answer to the Official Receiver, the debtor said the money had been paid. He kept no entries of the payments. The Registrar: What have you done with the receipts? The debtor: I never had any. The Registrar adjourned the case for a month, with leave to apply to the judge for the committal of the debtor.\n\n621\nSCHEU, E. T., timber merchant, Tuilerie Street, Hackney Road.—This case was noticed in our last issue, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday before Mr. Assistant Receiver. The accounts showed gross liabilities £1,480 2s. 3d., of which £1,285 are expected to rank, and assets estimated at £205. The following are scheduled as creditors :—\nUNSECURED.\n... £ s. d.\nBamberger L., Broad Street Buildings, E.C. ... 111 1 6\nBecket —, St. Bennet's Place, E.C. ... 25 11 7\nCameron E.

The debtor put forward another proposal, by which he said that 2s. 6d. in the pound would shortly be paid if the creditors would give him time for the balance, but eventually the case went into bankruptcy. Mr. H. W. Bayne, timber merchant, 86, Leadenhall Street, was appointed trustee of the estate, with a committee of inspection consisting of Messrs. Partridge (Bryant, Powis, & Bryant), C. Lavy, and E. Sherry.\nTHOMAS, CHARLES and GEORGE EGBERT, builders and contractors, West Cowes, S.W. — The statement of affairs filed herein shows unsecured creditors £1,652 15s. 11d., creditors partly secured £300, less estimated value of security £100—£200, and assets, property at estimated cost £220, book debts, good £97 19s. 5d., doubtful £15 16s. 9d., bad £2 5s. 3d.—£116 1s. 5d.; total £336 1s. 5d., less preferential creditors £175 18s., net assets £144 1s. 11d., and a deficiency of £1,708 14s. The debtors allege their failure to be \"excess of assets when the partnership began in Aug. 1883; loss on contracts, and on speculation; payments made to relatives in connection with the estate, law costs, interest,\" &c. The Official Receiver's observations are:—The partnership commenced in August, 1883. The debtors state that at the time the assets were much in excess of the liabilities. I am not yet in a position to report upon the trading or the accounts; the books are in arrears, and are now being written up. The statement filed by the debtors discloses unsecured liabilities amounting to £1,652 15s. 11d., this sum is made up of the claims of over 60 creditors. The creditors holding security are Messrs. A. & W. Sharp & Co., the security consisting of two orders for £100 each, given upon moneys coming to the debtors on the completion of certain contracts at present unfinished. An aggregate sum of £145 is due to 60 workmen for wages. There is no deficiency account attached to the statement of affairs. At the date of the receiving order four contracts were in progress. I thought it well to obtain professional advice before determining what course should be adopted with reference to the work, and I submitted to the surveyor's report will be submitted to the meeting.

Thomas, the statement of affairs filed shows unsecured creditors £58, fully secured £254, security £401—£147; partly secured £195, security £160—£35; and assets, property, at estimated cost, furniture £70, property £50, total £120, surplus, £345.
