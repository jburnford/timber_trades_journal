FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ADAMS, E. T., builder, 2, Osborne Grove, Upper Tollington Park, N.—The receiving order in this case was made upon the petition of Eastwood & Co. (Limited), creditors for £271 11s. 8d., and the meeting for the bankrupt's public examination was held on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard. No accounts were filed, and the bankrupt did not appear. Mr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver, and said that the bankrupt had not surrendered. His Honour accordingly ordered an adjournment sine die.
BARNS, J. T., timber and wood hoop merchant, &c., 389, Kennington Road, and Carlisle Street, Lambeth.—The bankrupt filed his petition in March last, and he applied to the Court last week for his order of discharge. Mr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver, Mr. F. C. Sydney for the bankrupt, and Mr. Howard for an opposing creditor. The liabilities expected to rank were returned at £1,726 13s. 8d., and proofs have been made for £1,342 19s. 10d. The assets were estimated by the bankrupt to realise £600 19s. 1d., but they are estimated by the trustee as likely to realise £500. It appeared from the Official Receiver's report that the bankrupt began business as a timber and wood hoop merchant in January, 1886, with stock and cash amounting to £100, and in March, 1887, he took the “Goat” beerhouse at Kennington. On January 1st, 1888, he commenced a contract for the supply of hoops to a dock company, to carry out which he states that he borrowed £500. Owing to the expense of delivery, for which the bankrupt states he had not allowed a sufficient margin, the contract resulted in a loss. He attributed his failure to his expenses having exceeded his profits, chiefly in respect of the contract above mentioned, to a loss of £229 by bad debts, and to loss on the trading at the beerhouse. The Official Receiver reported as an offence that the bankrupt had neglected to keep proper books of account; and Mr. Howell submitted that such neglect had been attended with serious results, inasmuch as the bankrupt had gone on trading and contracting debts in ignorance of his position. It was manifestly hopeless for a man who carried on two businesses to have a proper grasp of his affairs without, as in the present case, keeping either a cash book or bought ledger. The books were altogether insufficient, and suspended the bankrupt's discharge for twelve months.
BRETON, EDWIN, builder and contractor, Lichfield Street, and Birch Terrace, Hanley.—This was the adjourned examination of the above, the case having been adjourned to enable the debtor to furnish an account of receipts and payments from the 22nd May, 1888.

DAVIES, THOMAS, carpenter, Monmouth-shire.—The statement of affairs filed shows unsecured creditors £822 1s. 3d., and assets: estimated cost, stock-in-trade £23, furniture £75, carpenter's plant £7 10s., interest in leasehold property £10, total £118 10s., estimated to produce £118, book debts, good £120 5s., less preferential creditors £17 19s. 6d., leaving net assets of £719 15s. 9d. The causes of his failure to be:—“Slackness of trade, bad debts, and household expenses in excess of profits.” The Official Receiver's observations are:—“The recent debtor's own petition, on which he was also adjudged bankrupt. He informed me at his preliminary examination that he carried on the business of his late father, who died in July, 1885, having a liability of about £80. The books of account, which he admits having kept, are ledgers only. The debtor stated that he has never been solvent, and in his deficiency account he returns the excess of liabilities over assets on June 1st, 1888, as £528 19s. 5d. He also included in that account the following further particulars:—‘Net loss arising from the carrying on business from the 1st June, 1888, to date of receiving order, after deducting from profits the usual trade expenses £30, bad debts £4 16s. 4d., and household expenses incurred since the 1st June, 1888, amounting to £156. The item of £10 entered above is the estimated value of interest on certain leasehold property, to which the debtor states he is entitled upon the death of a relative. I should point out that I have received a notice from the landlord claiming the furniture upon the premises, and I am at present investigating the claim, and hope to be in a position to report thereon at the first meeting of creditors.” The following are the creditors:—

GAILLARD, J. C. B., Blaenavon, Court, Whitcomb Street, Pall Mall East.—The first meeting of creditors in this case was held last week, before Mr. Brougham, Assistant Receiver. The accounts showed unsecured debts, £1,215; and debts fully secured, £947; with an estimated surplus in assets, subject to realisation, of £139 18s. 3d. Mr. Lewis (Lewis & Churchman) appeared for the debtor, and submitted a scheme for payment of the debts in full with interest at 4 per cent. The estate would be vested in a trustee and the debtor be allowed to complete the building of a house in Whitcomb Street. By the adoption of this course it was anticipated that the debts would be paid within a year, the payments to be made in three equal instalments at four, eight, and twelve months from the date of approval. The proposal was unanimously agreed to, and Mr. L. Hasluck, accountant, Holborn Viaduct, was appointed trustee under the scheme.
HALL, F. J. B., trading as Hall & Co., at 91, Hornsey Road, N., and 91, Finsbury Pavement, E.C., timber merchant, Hornsey Road.—The bankrupt, who traded in Hornsey Road as E. J. Hall & Co., and at Finsbury Pavement as Griffiths, Hall, & Co., attended for his public examination last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The accounts showed gross liabilities £12,593 11s., of which £7,005 6s. 4d. are unsecured, and assets £755 7s. 11d. Mr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver and Mr. H. Reed for the bankrupt. Upon examination the bankrupt said that he began business as a timber merchant in 1882 with a capital of £250. Four years later he made a private arrangement with his creditors, and continued his business. In the autumn of last year he entered into a verbal arrangement for a partnership, and the gentleman was to bring in a sum of £500 as capital, an office being opened at Finsbury Pavement, with a view to carrying on the business under the style of Griffiths, Hall, & Company. At that time the bankrupt said he believed he was perfectly solvent, but he had since ascertained that debts then due, amounting to £3,900, were of no value. In consequence of a heavy failure in trade he lost a large sum, which frightened Mr. Griffiths, and he refused to carry out the proposed partnership. He did a large timber business and gave a deal of credit. His failure had been brought about by the failure of others. He had not made out a balance-sheet since
