Brownlee & Co., Caledonian Saw-mills, Grangemouth, to the number of about fifty, held their annual summer's outing on Thursday of last week. The excursion took the form of a drive to the old village of Cramond, passing through Borrowstounness, and by kind permission of the proprietors, passing through the beautiful policie of Hopet un and Dalmeny. From the latter a splendid view of that grand specimen of engineering, viz., the Forth Bridge, was had. Their destination was reached about 1 p.m., when dinner was spread upon the grass, and the day being all that could be desired, the meal was much enjoyed. After spending a few hours in sports, &c., the return journey was made via Kirkliston, arriving at Linlithgow about 6 p.m., where tea was partaken of in the Palace Hotel. The company then visited the old Palace and Linlithgow, and also enjoyed an hour's row on the loch adjoining loch, from which a good view of the town can be had. The party reached home about 11 p.m., all highly pleased with their day's enjoyment. A conspicuous feature was the dress worn by all the gentlemen, consisting of the large summer hats with the firm's name and other mark of Messrs. Brownlee & Co., painted on front.\n\nPORT HOPETOUN VENEER\nSAWING & MOULDING MILLS,\nFountainbridge, EDINBURGH.\nAmerican and Baltic Timber, Seasoned Home woods, Veneers Cut, Mouldings, Floorings, and Linings.\n\nBEITH & CO.,\nTimber Importers,\nDUNDEE.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Redwood, Whitewood, Wainscot Flooring, and Pitch Pine, also Teak, Greenheart, and Elm.\n\nTelegraphic Address—\n\"PATON,\" AYR.\nJAMES DONALDSON & SON,\nTimber Merchants,\nTAYPORT, LEVEN, &c.\nTelegram Addresses—\nDONALDSON, TAYPORT.\nDONALDSON, LEVEN.\nEVERY DESCRIPTION OF HOME AND FOREIGN TIMBER.\n\nA. & W.
