Preferential creditors, £7 7s. 2d. and assets, cash paid solicitors £10; cash in hand 15s.: £10 15s. Property at estimated cost, stock-in trade, £310; farming stock, &c. £100; office furniture, £30, £440, estimated to produce £250; book debts, good, £47 13s. 4d.; surplus from securities, £860 4s. 4d.; total, £1,168 12s. 8d.; less preferential creditors, £127 15s.; leaving net assets, £1,040 17s. 8d. and a deficiency of £972 5s. 5d. The debtor alleges the cause of his failure to be, break down of his health three months ago in consequence of which the business declined, leaving liabilities in consequence of his failing to dispose of house\n\nJULY 13, 1889.] THE T[?]\nproperties which he had built. The Official Receiver's observations are:—The debtor states he commenced business in 1883 with a capital of about £1,000, which he had saved, being the amount of his savings as schoolmaster. The premises St. Mary's Nursery are stated to be held on a lease for Christmas 1888, for ninety-nine years, at the yearly rental of £30, and is now in the possession of the debtor's bankers, but was paid into the debtor's banking account, and the bank took against an overdraft, and the debtor's solicitor is now in possession of the lease, which is valued by the debtor at £395. The creditors fully secured hold mortgages on property in Tottenham, Edmonton and Walthamstow, in respect of loans made up to the early part of this year. A private meeting of creditors was held on the 14th June last, when a composition of 10s. in the pound was proposed, but this was refused, as the first instalment was not secured. The debtor now states that he intends to propose a composition of 10s. in the pound, with security for the first instalment down, and the others in three, six, nine and twelve months. He states he did not become aware that he was insolvent until within the last two months. He has contracted debts since then with the expectation that he would be able to pay them with some money which was offered by way of mortgage on the lease, but the negotiations fell through. The furniture on the debtor's premises is claimed by his wife. The debtor states he has drawn out of the business for his household and personal expenditure during the last three years about £23 per week. Deficiency accounts:—Excess of assets over liabilities on the 18th June, 1888, £354 11s. 6d.; net profit arising from carrying on business from the 18th June, 1888, date of receiving order, after deducting usual trade expenses, viz., sale of eight houses in Argyll Street, £88. Income or profit for other sources since the 18th June, 1888. Rents received £903 0s. 1d.; deficiency as per debtor accounts for as follows:—Household expenses of self, wife, and five children since 18th June, 1888, £150; premium and repayments paid on purchase of appropriations in building societies about £950; subscription shares in building societies, £72 17s.; solicitor's cost, £10; depreciation on stock, &c., £190; law costs in connection with transfer of property, £290.

The proceedings were instituted in January, 1888, and it appears that proof for £758, and that the assets have yielded a dividend of 1s. 3½d. in the pound. Mr. Johnson Watson appeared in support of the application and Mr. Howell for the Official Receiver. The bankrupt had for the past thirteen years carried on business as a builder and carpenter, and had also acted as a rent collector and private inquiry agent. Since 1884 he had accepted bills for the accommodation of another person, and payments for £697 had been made in respect of such bills. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had, by accepting the bills in question, contracted debts without reasonable expectation of being able to pay them, and that he had omitted to keep proper books of account. Mr. Watson, for the bankrupt, said that he had always been able to pay his way until he was unfortunately induced to put his name to bills for the accommodation of a friend in the belief that he was perfectly solvent, but who afterwards absconded leaving the bankrupt to meet the liabilities. His Honour, taking all the circumstances into consideration, granted the bankrupt his discharge subject to a nominal suspension for three weeks from the date of his passing his examination in February, 1888.\nCOPE, JAMES, builder, Farthing Lane, Maney, Sutton Coldfield.—The Official Receiver has issued his report on this case, from which it appears that the debtor commenced business as a builder at Maney in 1880, with a capital of about £10. In November last he commenced a contract at Blossomfield, Solihull, for the erection of two villas, at a cost of £1,472. £965 had been paid to him on account of this, and he estimated they would cost about £250 to £300 to complete. He was unable to proceed, and on the 9th June the work was taken out of his hands. In February last he commenced a contract at School Road, Moseley, for the erection of two villas at a cost of £910. He had received £522, and estimated it would cost about £10 to complete. In the following month he commenced building two other villas in the same road for £999. He had been paid £274, and estimated it would cost about £30 to complete. In those cases the debtor, through want of funds, ceased working on the 1st June. The failure was attributed to the debtor being unable to obtain payment, at the proper time, of money due under the contract, and consequent pressure by creditors. The first meeting of creditors was held on the 4th inst., at the offices of the Official Receiver, Birmingham, and the debtor, having no offer to submit to his creditors, the estate was left in the hands of the Official Receiver as trustee. The debtor's accounts show liabilities expected to rank for dividend £750 18s. 2d., and assets £45 3s. 7d., or a deficiency of £705 14s. 7d.\nCOOPER, J. G., builder, Station Road, Clapham, and Josephine Avenue, Brixton Hill, S.W.—This failure occurred in May, 1888, and the case has been adjourned from time to time for further accounts. The gross liabilities amounted to £17,744, of which £10,738 was fully secured, and £7,005 expected to rank, the assets being estimated at £1,670. The adjourned sitting for public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. In reply to Mr. Howell, who appeared for the Official Receiver, the bankrupt stated that he commenced business about 1882 or 1883, and was engaged in the timber trade up to the time of the receiving order. In December, 1884, he made out a balance sheet, which showed a surplus at that date of £574, and he afterwards embarked in building operations. He attributed his failure to bad debts, and his inability to complete his properties. Losses by bad debts were an ordinary cause of failure in the timber and brick trades. He had traded jointly with a John Roe, whose estate was now in Chancery. He was formerly a traveller in the timber trade, and when he started on his own account he dealt with some of the persons with whom he had previously dealt as a traveller. He gave bills for timber which had seven months to run, it being usual in the trade to give that amount of credit. The examination was ordered to be concluded.\nCUMBERLAND, A., Romford Road.—The bankrupt was formerly in the timber trade, and the receiving order against his estate was made in December last, upon the petition of Messrs. Burt, Boulton, & Haywood, timber merchants, Cannon Street. Application was made on Wednesday for the approval of resolutions passed by the creditors for the acceptance of a composition of 2s. 6d. in the pound, payable forthwith. The liabilities are returned at £1,277 19s. and the assets at £250, and the Official Receiver reported that the composition was reasonable and calculated to benefit the creditors. It appeared that bankrupt began business as a brick and timber merchant in 1864 without capital, and in December, 1869, he was adjudged bankrupt, under which proceedings he subsequently obtained his discharge. He continued the same business as well as that of a corn merchant, and in January, 1876, he presented a petition for liquidation, under which his creditors accepted a composition of 2s. 6d. in the pound. He afterwards traded successfully until about two years ago, and stated that",
