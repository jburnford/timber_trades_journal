Wherever stations are established in the Quetta district, trees, flowers, and vegetables are planted, and the same is the case with the new Russian settlements along the course of the Transcaspian Railway and the Oxus River. Of the two, the Russians have been more systematic than ourselves, and have spent considerably more money. This is due to the interest taken in the matter by General Annenkoff, who is a born founder of colonies, and takes as much interest in all that appertains to the Transcaspian settlements as Robinson Crusoe did in his \"desert island.\" At a recent meeting at St. Petersburg, General Annenkoff gave an account of some of his operations in this direction. He admitted very frankly that the tree planting of the last three years had not been altogether a success, many imported trees and shrubs having perished, but experience had shown what would and what would not thrive, and seeds were being obtained from various parts of the world that would thrive in the sandy soil of the Kara Kum, exposed to the widest possible variations of heat and cold, or in the irrigated clayey expanses of the Merv, Tejend, and Atak oases. Meanwhile the Russian authorities are looking well after the local flora. Orders have been given that no bushes are to be cut down within ten miles of the line, and that the existing forests of saxaul are to be preserved. Saxaul is a kind of heavy, extremely knotted briar-wood, attaining a forest growth in places, and provides most of the fuel hitherto used in the country. It grows readily in sand, which it moreover serves to bind together by its long trailing clumsy roots. Plantations of this are to be made along the line, with camel thorn and other native bushes that thrive well, and it is expected that in time there will be not only a sufficient growth of vegetation to protect the line, but also provide shelter for weaker trees and bushes of foreign origin. In the meanwhile, oil refuse from Baku is being used as household fuel by the Russians, and as soon as cheap suitable stoves are introduced the population will probably become more and more accustomed to rely upon oil for fuel purposes. Every step in this direction is a boon, because it tends to save more and more the timber in Central Asia, and thereby contributes to a reforesting of a country once densely covered with trees, and at that period famous throughout Asia for its fertility. This fertility the Russian engineer is now attempting to gradually restore.—Engineering.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nBARROW.\nJuly 15 Dalbeattie (s)-Sundswall-825 lds. sawn fir-The Executors of Wm.
