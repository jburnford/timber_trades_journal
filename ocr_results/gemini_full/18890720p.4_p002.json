The better the glue the more water will it absorb in melting. The finest quality of glue absorbs twelve times its weight of water, while that made from white bones, cheap refuse takes up only from three to five times its weight of water.\n\nFALL FROM THE BLARNEY STONE.—A carpenter, named Cornelius Cahill, in attempting to kiss the famous Blarney Stone in the County of Cork on Sunday, lost his balance and fell a distance of 50 ft. His fall was broken by a tree, and though he was unconscious when taken up, he sustained no more serious injury than a sprained ankle.\n\nA NOVEL SCHEME TO RAISE THE SULTAN.—A novel proposal in connection with the Sultan is now being considered by the Admiralty. Mr. Whiteside Smith proposes to raise the ship at an estimated cost of about £1,500 by making the deck sound and then blowing the water out of the leaks. Hydrogen is the agent to be employed, and can be produced in sufficient quantities on barges on the spot by the action of sulphuric acid upon zinc. The feasibility of the plan had been demonstrated so far by models, and it is not at all unlikely that the experiment will be tried.\n\nJOHN FLEMING & CO.,\nTimber Importers & Saw-millers,\nALBERT QUAY, ABERDEEN.\nTelegraphic Address—\"ALBERT, ABERDEEN.\"\nLargest Stocks in the North of Baltic, American, and Fancywood Goods.\n\nJAMES JOHNSTON,\nTimber Merchant and Saw-miller\nTHE SHORE,\nSTIRLING.\n\nA SALE DAY AT LEITH.\nA few Copies of the TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL of the 15th inst., containing the Leith Portrait Group, are still on Sale.\nPrice 4 1/2d. post free.\nWILLIAM RIDER & SON, LONDON",
