DESTRUCTION OF POLMONT SAW-MILL BY FIRE.—On Thursday morning the extensive saw-mill at Polmont Station, and now occupied by Mr. Archibald Paterson, was burnt down to the ground, and the valuable machinery destroyed. The stock of timber in the yard was small, but the total damage is estimated at about £2,000. We understand that the property is covered to some extent by insurance. The cause of the origin of the fire is not known.

THE ELECTRIC LIGHTING PLANT AT MESSRS. JOHN MITCHELL & CO.'S SAW-MILLS, LEITH.
The appliances have now been fitted up, and the new system is in full working order, and in no part of the buildings is there any necessity for gas or other light, and it is also proposed eventually to light the yard proper by means of arc lights.
The lights are of the incandescent form, and the lamps used are the well-known Edison Swan lamps. They are of 16 nominal candle-power each, and about 50 in all are in the meantime installed.
The current for supplying these lamps is obtained from a small dynamo driven directly from the shop shafting.
The dynamo runs at about 1,100 revolutions per minute, a speed with which saw-millers are quite familiar, and which is, in this case, obtained with the greatest ease.
The dynamo, which is of Messrs. King, Brown, & Co.'s own manufacture, is what is known as "compound wound." By this is meant that form of winding which enables the potential or pressure at which the current is delivered to remain practically constant, no matter whether the machine is doing its full work or not. By this means it is possible to switch on or off any number of the lights without in any way altering the brightness of the remainder.
It is, of course, an advantage to switch off or turn off lamps which may not be immediately in use, for not only is the life or duration of the lamp saved, but the power used, being exactly in the ratio of the number of lamps at any one time burning, the horse-power taken from the main engine, and consequently steam and fuel, are reduced to a minimum. The dynamo has double brushes on each side of the commutator. The brushes are bunches of copper wire, which press on the revolving surface of the commutator, and from it collect the current. By having the brushes in duplicate as here it is possible to undertake long-continued running without interfering with the lighting, as the brushes, which are the only wearing parts of the dynamo, save the bearings, can be altered and adjusted alternately.
The entire dynamo, which is very compact, is mounted on two planed iron slides, which contain an easily-adjustable screw gear for taking up the slack in driving belt.
An especially noticeable feature is the method of receiving the spent oil. This is received in the standards of the machine direct

5
from the bearings, and taps are provided, from which the oil may be drawn when required.
The main wires are run from the dynamo to a small switch board fastened to the wall. There are two main switches, one for each of the shops. These switches are very carefully made, and are what are known as the double self-cleansing scrape contact type. In ordinary language this means that each time the switch is used the fact of shutting or opening it tends to scrape or clean the contact pieces. This cleanliness of contact is of great importance in electrical work.
The switches are mounted on slate bases, and each switch has a main safety fuse attached to it.
The use of fuses deserves a small amount of explanation. The electric light is spoken of, and rightly, as a safe light, and the use of which is calculated to reduce the risk of fire to a minimum. For this reason it has in this case been adopted, and Messrs. King, Brown, & Co. have also fitted an installation in a gunpowder factory, where the risk is very much greater. The great danger is that arising from what is known as short circuit. This is a means that the current is finding a shorter path back to the dynamo than through the lamps. In this case more current might be sent through a wire than the diameter of the wire is capable of carrying without heating.
Even in this exceptional event, however, the fusible cutout, or fuse, reduces the risk to a minimum, if it does not entirely obviate it. A cut-out is a small piece of lead wire, or tinfoil, supported in suitable holders and which is introduced into the circuit, and immediately the current in any wire exceeded 10 per cent. above the normal, this cutout would fuse across, thus automatically cutting off the current. In addition to the two main cutouts, each lamp throughout the place has its own fuse close beside it. The wires themselves, which are heavily covered or insulated with layers of cotton, indiarubber, and oxokerited hemp, are run in neat wooden cases with grooves hollowed to receive them.
The different fittings have been specially made for the different machines and special positions requiring them. Some are fixed with reflectors for general lighting, some are swung like gas brackets, some are swung in such a way that no gas bracket ever could be made to swing.
Those under the machines in the shaving and sawdust pits are made strong, and give a splendid light in a position where it would be absolutely impossible to introduce a gas jet.
