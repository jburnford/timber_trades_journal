If it fell into another tree the noise would be less, and they often brought that about purposely.\nCross-examined: He did not think the men did any damage in felling the trees. The damage to the apple tree did not arise through negligence.\nMr. J. C. Hill (senior partner in the firm of Messrs. Moore & Hill) said he had thirty years' experience in this part of the country, and knew the custom very well. He sold the timber in question. The custom was that the landlord had a perfect right to enter and cut timber at any reasonable time; he was not liable unless wilful damage was done. The reasonable time to fell elm was from October to the beginning of April. It was unusual to fell elm in the last week of March. The vendors took that view. They wanted to get the work over before the grass was grown.\nCross-examined: It was not usual to out elm in January. Much depended upon the time of the sale. The sap of the elm had not risen in March.\nThe advocates having addressed the jury, the learned judge summed up. The first question he put to the jury was, Did the defendant by his men enter upon the plaintiff's premises at a reasonable and seasonable time according to the incidence of a tenancy from year to year, and according to the custom of the part of that country?\nThe Foreman: We find that he had a right to enter.\nThe Judge: Upon that verdict the entry was lawful. Did defendant omit to do anything reasonable, or did he conduct the operation of felling with due and reasonable care and skill?\nThe Foreman: We think the defendant behaved properly and did the usual work with care and skill.\nThe Judge: That gets rid of the question of contributory negligence and of the horse. What were the incidents of entry? That some damage was done to the apple tree was admitted; but, according to the custom of the country, was the landlord bound to compensate the tenant?\nThe Foreman: We say the landlord is bound to compensate for wilful damage.\nThe Judge: What damage do you allow as done to the apple tree?\nThe Foreman: £1.\nAfter argument, the Judge said on the claim for trespass the plaintiff would recover £1 and costs, and on the question of negligence the defendant was entitled to costs, subject to the taxing master; in other words, the costs would be apportioned.\n\nTHE DALURA WOOD COMPANY.\nBefore Mr. Alderman Renals, on Wednesday last, the Dalura Wood Decoration (Ludwig Process) Company, Limited, of Queen Victoria Street, were summoned, at the instance of Frederick Richard, on a charge, under the Companies' Act, 1862, of unlawfully refusing to give him a copy of the register of shareholders.\nMr. C. F. Gill was counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Bodkin for the defence.\nProof of the refusal to supply the list having been given, Mr. Bodkin said no allotment of shares had been made, and the money had been returned to applicants. There was, therefore, no list of shareholders to supply, except the formal signatories to the articles of association.\nMr. Alderman Renals said, however that might, be a technical offence had been committed, and he fined the company 1d., without costs.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
