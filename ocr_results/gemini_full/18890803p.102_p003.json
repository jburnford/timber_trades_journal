Your correspondent adds \"We should be glad to hear of our friends at neighbouring ports doing better, dependent on sailing ships.\"\nWe last week discharged the Rising (s), 317 standards from Hudikswall, in 36 working hours, equal to 9 standards per hour and a week or two ago we discharged the Rising (s), from Hudikswall, 317 standards in 36 working hours, equal to 9 standards per hour.\nOur neighbours here are, therefore, not showing equally quick, and in some cases perhaps quicker, but certainly not quicker despatch, and you will readily perceive that we were much struck with wonder at the great performance of our Wisbech neighbours.\nKing's Lynn, July 30, 1889.\n[We are pleased to hear that King's Lynn is not behind her neighbours in the quick discharge of steamers. Our correspondent has missed the point of our remarks, which applied to neighbouring ports that were dependent on sailing ships.-ED.]\nRAILWAY AND CANAL TRAFFIC ACT.\nDEAR SIR,-I beg to inform you that this Chamber has, as you have already been informed, attempted to obtain from the managers of the leading railway companies replies to the points of classification and maximum rates objections lodged by the various Trade Sections on your behalf. In these interviews the railway managers raised the point in the first instance that the classification submitted by them under the Act must be a Paying Classification, and not a working classification. The Chamber, on the other hand, contended that the Act prevented the railway companies from \"upon\" on the basis of the proposed classification. The railway managers adhered to their contention that the proposed classification could not be altered in that direction, and the Chamber having taken the opposite direction, I have now to inform you that the railway companies have not seen their way to go further.\nUnder these circumstances it is evident that the railway companies are not prepared with their negotiations with the various objectors, and it is against the policy of this Chamber to such suggestions of compromise or private settlements I have had from time to time.\nIt will probably be within your recollection that, acting partly at the suggestion of this Chamber, the Lord Mayor convened, on Friday last, a meeting of representatives from all parts of the kingdom, at which a resolution, which should be taken as confirming the attitude of objectors. At this meeting a resolution was unanimously adopted, and I trust that you will not fail to see that negotiations with the railway companies are now at an end, and that the basis of a practical working classification is the only course.\nIt is most desirable that the various sections of the mercantile community should hold and work together, and that a strong and united body of the traders should be formed. It is only by unanimous action that a successful result is likely to be attained.\nI shall be glad to hear from you, in due course of form, that you are prepared to act upon the above suggestion, and remain,\nDear sir, yours faithfully,\nKENRIC B. MURRAY, Secretary.\nThe London Chamber of Commerce (Incorporated).\nBotolph House, Eastcheap, E.C.",
