CORRESPONDENCE.
QUICK DISCHARGE AT THE OUT-PORTS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—We notice a paragraph in your last week's issue referring to quick despatch of the Stokesby (s) at Wisbech, which discharged a cargo of 450 standards in 39 working hours, equal to 12 standards per hour, which your correspondent adds "must have taken our friends at neighbouring ports, who are still dependent on sailing ships, by surprise."
We last week discharged the John O. Scott (s), 317 standards from Archangel, in 21 working hours, equal to 15 1/4 standards per hour and a week or two previous the Castle Rising (s), from Hudikswall, 500 standards, in 36 working hours, equal to 14 standards per hour.
Our neighbours here could give you statistics showing equally quick despatch as ours, perhaps quicker, but with this information you will readily perceive that we are not struck with wonder at the rapid movements of our Wisbech neighbours.—Yours truly,
J. T. STANTON & Co.
King's Lynn, July 31st, 1889.
[We are pleased to hear that King's Lynn is not behind her neighbours in the rapid discharge of steamers, but our correspondent has missed the point of our remark, which applied to neighbouring ports who are still dependent on sailing ships."—ED.]

RAILWAY AND CANAL TRAFFIC ACT, 1888.
Dear Sir,—I beg to advise you that this Chamber has, as you have been previously informed, attempted to confer with the managers of the leading railway companies as to the points of classification raised under the objections lodged by the London Chamber on your behalf. In these conferences the railway managers raised the point of general principle that the classification to be arrived at under the Act must be a Parliamentary maximum, and not a working classification. The Chamber, on the other hand, held that nothing in the Act prevented the Parliamentary classification therein alluded to from being "agreed upon" on the basis of an actual working classification. The managers, however, held to their contention that a Parliamentary classification could not be a working classification, and the Chamber being equally firm in the opposite direction, I regret to have to inform you that the negotiations with the companies have not been able to proceed further.
Under these circumstances it is understood that the railway companies intend to proceed with their negotiations with individual objectors, and it is against the danger of acceding to such suggestions of private negotiations and private settlements I hereby beg to warn you.
It will probably be within your knowledge that, acting partly at the suggestion of this Chamber, the Lord Mayor convened, on Friday last, a meeting of all the objectors from all parts of the kingdom to consider the action which should be taken to protect the interests of objectors. At this meeting a resolution, confirming the attitude taken by this Chamber, was unanimously adopted, and I therefore trust that you will not agree to any negotiations with the railway companies except upon the basis of a practical working classification.
It is most desirable at this juncture that all sections of the mercantile community should hold and work together against the organised and united body of the railway companies, as it is only by unanimous action that a successful result is likely to be attained.
I shall be glad to hear from you, as a matter of form, that you are prepared to comply with the above suggestion, and am meanwhile,
Dear sir, yours faithfully,
KENRIC B. MURRAY, Secretary.

The proofs having been read over, Mr. Ashfold was questioned respecting the estate, it being contended by Mr. Blanco White (who appeared for creditors) that the £8,000 returned in the accounts as assets would upon realisation be found to melt away considerably. It appeared that over £6,000 was represented by equities of redemption, and that the stock-in-trade, plant, and other property returned at about £1,700 were subject to charges in favour of the freeholder. Mr. R. Raphael attended the meeting on behalf of Messrs. Aldin & Co., Richmond, and asked why the debtors did not file their petition in pursuance of a resolution passed at a private meeting of creditors early in June. Mr. Ashfold said he did not understand that such a resolution had been passed. No proposal was made, and the proceedings accordingly resulted in bankruptcy. Mr. E. H. Collins, accountant, 19a, Coleman Street, was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Alfred Aldin, of Richmond; Mr. Jones, representing Messrs. Lee & Chapman; Mr. E. J. Scriven; Mr. J. Wiggins, representing Messrs. T. & W. Farmiloe; and Mr. F. J. Farquharson.

BENTLEY, A.—A meeting of the creditors of Alfred Bentley, builder and timber merchant, Tyldesley, near Bolton, was held on the 27th ult., at the offices of the Official Receiver, Bolton. The statement produced showed

liabilities £2,915 4s. 7d., and assets, consisting of stock-in-trade, £450; machinery, trade fixtures, and furniture, £420; book debts, £727 14s. 8d.; and surplus from securities, £120 15s. 8d.; total, £1,905 4s. 11d., less preferential claims, leaving net assets £1,784 9s. 3d. The debtor attributed his failure to want of capital, losses on contracts, and bad bookkeeping. There being no offer, bankruptcy was resolved upon, and Mr. Robert Jones, chartered accountant, Liverpool, was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection.
BRITTON, JOHN JAMES, of Alcester.—This debtor, who is a solicitor, formerly carrying on business at Camp Hill, Birmingham, as a timber merchant, under the style of the West Coast Timber Co., made an application to reinstate a proof of debt made by the Rev. Dr. Randall, of Handsworth, which had been rejected in part by the trustee (Mr. E. M. Sharp). His Honour decided in favour of Dr. Randall for a proof of £850 in respect to one portion and reserved his decision as to the remainder of the proof, which is a sum of over £6,000.
FOSTER, STEPHEN, wood merchant, Southview Cottages, West End, Esher.—The statement of affairs filed shows unsecured creditors £179 6s. 5d., creditors fully secured £390, estimated value of securities £547, surplus from securities plus £157, and as creditors fully secured £157, creditors £2 14s. 2d., leaving net assets £154 5s. 10d., and a deficiency of £25 0s. 7d. The bankrupt, who states he has carried on the businesses of fly proprietor and carman, commenced in 1880 with a capital of about £100, which was left to him. He attributes his failure to bad trade, losses on horses and cart, and of income by relinquishing his fly business. He states he has had no income during the last three years, and his household and personal expenditure has been 30s. per week. The following are the creditors :—

HARDY, R., builder, Swanage.—The sitting for the public examination of this debtor was held at the Poole Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday week before Mr. Registrar H. S. Dickinson. His statement of affairs showed gross liabilities of £3,439 11s. 1d., of which £935 7s. 5d. was expected to rank for dividend, the remainder being fully secured. In his assets debtor estimated a surplus of £1,099 for the securities in the hands of creditors, thus making the statement show a surplus of £412 1s. 11d. Debtor said he had been in business at Swanage for the last fifteen years, and previous to that time was manager with Mr. G. Burt. He had commenced business without capital and obtained materials on credit. He had been a speculative builder. The only books he had kept were day-books, wages-book, and bank-book. He was pressed by creditors three months before he filed his petition. He had two properties at Swanage, which he had been trying to sell privately for the last four years, but he had not been able to get a reasonable offer for them. He had gone on paying as long as he could. He called a private meeting of his creditors before filing his petition. His income during the last two years had been only about sufficient to meet his household expenses. The examination was closed.

The Official Receiver's observations are :—The receiving order was made on July 17th, and on the same day the debtor was adjudged bankrupt on his own petition. The debtor states that he formerly carried on a coal business in London Road, Brighton, with considerable success, but in or about 1883 he commenced building speculations, and being unsuccessful in that he was obliged to dispose of his coal business and arrange with his creditors. The bankrupt then commenced business as a contractor, with plant obtained on hire and purchase, which he succeeded in paying off about twelve months ago. The creditors are fully secured hold mortgages on various freehold properties in Brighton, from which the bankrupt states
