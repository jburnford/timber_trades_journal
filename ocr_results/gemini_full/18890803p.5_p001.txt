The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.

GAZETTE.
THOMSON, JAMES & SON.—James Thomson, sole partner of the firm of James Thomson & Son lathsplitters, 17, M'Aslan Street, Glasgow, was examined in bankruptcy on Friday, the 26th ult., before Sheriff Balfour.
Bankrupt stated that he had been in business since 1839.
His state of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £3,450, and assets to £2,940—a deficiency of £470.
He attributed his failure to a series of losses in business.
During the last twelve years he had lost £4,478, and of that sum £3,000 was lost during the last five years.
This closed the examination.
