Mr. Dunn proposed that the matter should be again remitted to the Council to watch over it.
Dr. Somerville took occasion in this connection to address the meeting, and he asked its aid in the lectures which he proposed to deliver in the winter.
Mr. Methven proposed that the matter be remitted to the Council. He was sure such lectures would be of great service to foresters.
This was agreed to.
With regard to next year's excursion, Mr. Dunn mentioned various places open to a visit by the society. There was no discussion, and the subject was remitted to the Council.
The meeting, on the motion of Mr. Dunn awarded its thanks to Professor Balfour for his energy in retaining the Botanic Garden as Crown property instead of handing it over to the University, as was proposed in the University Bill.
Professor Balfour, in reply, thanked the society for having combined with others in pressing on the Government the importance of keeping the Botanic Garden Crown property, and he hoped the public had already received some advantage from the new arrangements.
This was all the business of importance, and the meeting ended, after thanking Professor Balfour for the use of the hall, and the chairman for presiding.
The members of the society afterwards dined together in the Waterloo Hotel—Dr. Cleghorn presiding, and Mr. John Methven acting as croupier. After the loyal toasts, the chairman proposed “The Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society,” and in doing so spoke hopefully of the future of forestry in this country. Mr. M'Corquodale, the senior vice-president of the society, acknowledged the toast. A number of complimentary toasts followed, and, on the motion of Mr. Hutchison, of Carlowrie, it was remitted to the Council to prepare a loyal address to the patron of the society, the Queen, on the marriage of Her Majesty's granddaughter, the Princess Louise of Wales, to a Peer of Scotland, who was not only a large landed proprietor, but an extensive owner of woodlands.
In the evening between thirty and forty members, from all parts of Scotland, left the Waverley Station by the east route for Worksop on their annual excursion. Their

GLASGOW CARTERS' STRIKE.—The carters in the employment of the Caledonian Railway on Wednesday returned to work, though it is stated they have done so under the misapprehension an advance would be granted. The manager states that no such promise has been made. Several employers have agreed to the men's demands, but the railway companies still decline to consider the question, until the men shall have returned to work.

Redwood, as a finishing wood, is growing in popularity on the Pacific coast, and it has a certain beauty of solidity that no veneering or mahogany or satinwood can produce. In a dining-room finished with this wood, the joists of the ceiling were polished, and crossed each other in squares, in the Norman style of finish. The wainscoting was framed in highly-coloured wood, while the panels were of the dark and curled variety, producing a fine contrast. The mantel and its shelving were made of selected pieces of curled wood, richly carved, the whole producing an effect surpassed by no other wood.—The Lumberman.
