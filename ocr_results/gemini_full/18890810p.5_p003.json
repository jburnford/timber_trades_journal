From its origin it has devoted itself exclusively to the hardwood business, and came into the possession of the present firm in 1868, on the retiral of the well-known firm of Muir and Thompson, and concentrated in their present establishment in Berkeley Street, Mr. Inglis having been connected with the business as manager from his youth, and since his assumption to the proprietary, by his experience of this branch of the trade and the reputation maintained by the firm by their straightforward dealings, have been able to surround themselves with customers over a wide district. The yard and buildings cover an area of about half an acre, and are conveniently situated for the carrying on of the retail business which they have cultivated.\n\nThe yard is stocked with the usual assortment of fancy woods in logs of mahogany, walnut, wainscot, ash, &c., with a crane for their manipulation; a large shed three storeys in height in erected for the storage and seasoning of all kinds of boards and planks, which for this class of material is a matter of the greatest importance. Long racks are also erected in the open for the weather seasoning of the wood reared up on end; a room store is also devoted to the keeping of veneers, of which a varied stock is kept of mahogany, oak, and walnut, and in which a considerable trade is done. In looking over these we noticed some very fine specimens, showing rare figure for furniture and artistic work.\n\nThe sawing machinery consists of a double horizontal saw, capable of cutting any size of log and driven by steam power; the other machinery, consisting of circular saws, band-saws, turning lathes, &c., is devoted to the\n\nTelephone No. 621.\nTelegraphic Address—\"FIRTH, EDINBURGH.\"\nWILLIAM M'DOUGALL & CO.,\nPACKING-CASE MAKERS,\n177, FOUNTAINBRIDGE, EDINBURGH.\nTin, Zinc, and Oilcloth Lined Cases for Export, &c.\n\nWILLIAM CUMMINGS,\nPacking-box Maker & Wood Turner,\n9, MURANO PLACE (LEITH WALK), EDINBURGH.\nAll kinds of Boxes made to order.

We noticed considerable stocks of lignum-vitæ in the log, of which variety the firm seems to make a speciality, being largely used in ships' block work. Yards exclusively devoted to the cultivation of the hardwood trades are places of rare and fancy woods necessarily kept in stock, and tempt to an inclination to linger unduly in a study of some of these beautiful specimens. As a rule, for innumerable are the varieties we noticed in passing through the several stores, where the more fancy kinds are carefully kept.\n\nThe sole partners of the firm are now the Messrs. Inglis, who, in their unostentatious way, fully share in the general development of this growing branch of the trade.\n\nHandbook to the Timber, Saw-mill, and some of the Principal Wood Consuming Trades.\nDemy 8vo., handsome cloth gilt, 7s. 6d., carriage paid.\n\nTHE\nWOOD TRADES DIRECTORY.\nComplete Classified Lists of the Firms in\nENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND AND IRELAND.\n\nWILLIAM RIDER & SON,\n14, BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE, LONDON, E.C.\n\nGEORGE HALLIDAY,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchant & Saw-miller,\nRothesay Saw-mills, ROTHESAY.\nA large stock of Baltic and American Timber, all kinds of home-grown Timber, well-seasoned Spokes, Naves, Treads, &c., always on hand.\nManufacturer of Flooring, Mouldings, Architraves, &c.\nEvery description of Turned Goods.\n\nWM.
