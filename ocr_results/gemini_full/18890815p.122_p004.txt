LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
IN RE HENRY POUND, SON, & HUTCHINS, LIMITED.
This was the application, in the Court of Appeal on Thursday last, before Lord Justices Cotton, Fry, and Lopes, of the Debenture Corporation, Limited, from the order of Mr. Justice Kay appointing the liquidator the receiver of the assets comprised in the security of the debenture holders with liberty to attend proceedings until paid off.
Mr. Rigby, Q.C., in supporting the appeal of the Debenture Corporation, stated that the

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
motion before Mr. Justice Kay was that the property of Henry Pound, Son, & Hutchins might be handed over to a receiver appointed by his clients. The learned judge, in refusing the application, went on to appoint the liquidator of the company, which was in the course of being wound up, receiver for the debenture holders, a relief which they had not asked for, and which they did not desire. The debentures were issued in two series, amounting altogether to £20,000, the holders of both lots being the same persons—namely, the appellants. Nineteen thousand pounds of that sum remained unpaid, and was still held by the Debenture Corporation, Limited. Executions were issued against the company (Henry Pound, Son, & Hutchins, Limited). On the 4th of March, 1889, petitions were presented for winding up; on the 8th April demand was made for payment of the debentures; on the 4th of May an order was made on a creditor's petition for winding up the company, and a liquidator appointed, and the Debenture Corporation now asked, in pursuance of the contract they entered into with the company, that possession of the assets should be delivered up to them. Mr. Justice Kay considered he was at liberty to act on an analogy in the clause in a conveyancing act, which provided that in a suit for foreclosure or redemption the Court might make an order for the sale of the property. The learned judge decided that inasmuch as the Court must hear direct a redemption action, and had power to order a sale, he had jurisdiction to take the property out of the hands of the debenture holders. Their case was a very simple one. They said it was quite independent of any court they had a right to possession, but as a liquidator had been appointed their course was to inform the Court that they had the right, and then their question was that the rest followed. The order under the power contained in the deed, appointed a receiver on the 10th of May, 1889, but Mr. Justice Kay set aside their arrangement altogether, and ordered the liquidator to be the receiver.
Mr. Renshaw, Q.C., having followed on the same side,
Mr. Marten, Q.C. (with him Mr. John Chester), who opposed the appeal, argued that Mr. Justice Kay had exercised a proper discretion. When an order for winding up was made these extraordinary powers which had been given with the ordinary winding up.
The Lord Justices made an order that the debenture holders' receiver should be forthwith allowed to take possession of all the property, both real and personal, belonging to the company, the order to be without prejudice to any question which might be raised by the company as to the power of the receiver other than the power to take possession of the property or to sell the same.
DETENTION OF A SHIP.
THE SHIP W. G. RUSSELL COMPANY, LIMITED, v. HARRISON, ROBINSON, & Co.
At the Nisi Prius Court, on Saturday, before Mr. Justice Grantham and a special jury, the plaintiffs in this case, represented by Mr. Kennedy, Q.C., and Mr. Taylor, claimed from the defendants, who are Liverpool timber merchants, and who were represented by Mr. Barnes, Q.C., and Mr. Thomas, £126 for demurrage of the ship W. G. Russell. On the 29th March last the vessel had arrived from Pensacola with a consignment of pitch pine and pencil cedar for defendants. Unloading commenced on the 30th March, and was not finished till the 17th April, a period which, according to plaintiffs' contention, exceeded what was reasonable by seven days, and demurrage at the rate of £18 per day was sued for. The defendants maintained that the unloading had proceeded with customary despatch, one team being employed, as was usual in Liverpool. The plaintiffs held that the timber could have been got out very much faster than it was had two logs been hauled out at a time, instead of one. The defendants' answer to this was that the quay space at command would not have permitted of this accelerated discharge. They also pleaded the absence of any special arrangement for discharging. The judge said he was surprised to see that, notwithstanding the progress which had been made during the last forty years, there should still be a desire to adhere to the slow system in vogue at the beginning of that period. The verdict was in favour of the plaintiff to the amount of £72, which was calculated on four days' detention beyond a reasonable period.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ALLEN G. H., builder, Hercules Buildings, Lambeth, S.E.—The bankrupt filed his petition in May last, and he applied to Mr. Registrar Giffard on Wednesday for his order of discharge. It appears that proofs of debt have been made for £912 13s., and the assets are stated to have realised £212 19s. 2d. The bankrupt stated that he had been in business for many years as a builder and contractor in Lambeth, and he attributed his failure to a liability of £421 for costs incurred in defending an action for the recovery of possession of a plot of land in Camberwell, on which he was building on behalf of his co-defendant. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt's books of account were insufficient, and that he had previously failed in 1882, when he paid a composition of 5s. in the pound on debts amounting to between £3,000 and £4,000. Mr. Registrar Giffard suspended the order of discharge for three months.
EVERETT, ALFRED POORE, builder, Estate Office and Oak Bank, New Hampton. This bankrupt attended at the Kingston Bankruptcy Court on Friday week, before Mr. Registrar Bell, when the Assistant Official Receiver (Mr. Britten) said in this matter he had to apply for an adjournment, as the debtor had failed to file his statement of affairs, and he had also been requested by the petitioning creditors' solicitors to apply for an adjournment, as they were in possession of information which required further investigation before they proceeded with the examination. The examination was adjourned till October 18th, and the order applied for made.
HICKINBOTHAM, WILLIAM, builder and contractor, Teddington.—The adjourned public examination was held at the Kingston Bankruptcy Court on Friday week, before the Registrar. The Deputy Official Receiver said the bankrupt could not comply with an order for a cash account. So far as he was concerned the examination could be closed, but the trustee was not there to say if he was satisfied with the accounts furnished. Later on the solicitor for the trustee appeared and reported that the accounts filed were in order, so the examination was closed.
HILL, REUBEN, builder, West Green, and Melgund Road, N.—The debtor has filed his petition, and on Wednesday, upon the application of Mr. J. Gibson, a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Brougham. The debtor states that he is building thirty houses in Melgund Road under a building agreement; he has finished fifteen of the houses, and the others have got to be finished. The amount of the liabilities and assets did not transpire.
KENT, F., builder and contractor, Hastings. —The sitting for the public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Hastings Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Young. Mr. A. Mackintosh (Official Receiver) represented the Board of Trade, but the trustee was not present or represented. Bankrupt said he had arranged to pay a composition to his creditors, and the Official Receiver not wishing to prolong the examination, an order for its closing was made and the bankrupt allowed to pass.
KNIGHT, JAMES, builder, Ricketts Street, Fulham, S.W.—Under a receiving order made in this case on the 9th ult., accounts have now been furnished showing unsecured liabilities £737 17s. 11d., and debts fully secured £459 12s. 10d.; assets, £127 19s. 11d. The bankrupt states that he commenced business in 1876 with £300 as a mason and builder. He attributes his insolvency chiefly to bad debts, to his profits having been in excess of his profits, to depreciation in the value of his stock and effects as now estimated for realisation, and other causes.
MEARS, ISAAC, builder, late Birchanger Road, South Norwood, and Wood Green.—The first meeting in this case was held last week, before Mr. Stewart, Assistant Receiver. The unsecured debts are £683 2s., and debts fully secured £8,299 9s., assets, nil. The following were scheduled as creditors :—
