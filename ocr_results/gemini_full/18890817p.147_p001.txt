AMERICAN NOTES.
During the months of April, May, and June, of 1889, there entered the port of Pensacola 74 foreign vessels having an aggregate tonnage of 55,037. During the same months this year the entrances of foreign vessels amounted to 165, with a total tonnage of 123,099—a showing for those months of 1889 of business more than double that of the corresponding period in last year. During the month of July, 1888, but nine foreign vessels entered the port of Pensacola. The entrance in July will aggregate 50 or more. Fifty vessels at any time means not less than a distribution of 300,000 dols., shared in by merchants of all kinds, as that sum is disbursed by the different direct beneficiaries of the vast shipping interest of the port. There is quite a large list of vessels reported up, cleared and sailed for Pensacola. The list of vessels in port is of quite respectable proportions, and the list of vessels at quarantine quite encouraging in its numbers. All the present prosperity is due alone to the timber and lumber traffic, which has assumed such gigantic proportions of late years in the yellow pine sections of the United States.
The commercial year at Mobile is drawing to a close, and we are able to form some idea of the business we have done, especially in the exportation of lumber and timber. The season has been decidedly a favourable one, and there has also been such an extension of the summer business that really there is no hiatus. The figures are very encouraging. Making no allowance for any increase in the shipments of lumber by rail, we have sent out this year (or rather, will have sent out by September 1st) 130 million feet—a rise of 25 million feet over the shipments of last year. And this is how I make the calculations:—

timber. timber. Lumber.
Cub. ft. Cub. ft. Sup. ft.
1887-8 ..... 1,367,350 1,146,996 25,735,105
1888-9 ..... 1,028,081 1,624,427 42,427,899
Increase ... ... 477,431 16,692,788
Decrease ... 339,269 ... ...
These are exports to July. Reducing the timber to superficial feet, we have for 1887-8 a total of timber and lumber amounting to 55,906,260 superficial feet. By the same process we have for 1888-9 a total of 74,257,992, showing a net increase for this year of 18,351,732.—Southern Lumberman.

BRYANT & MAY, LIMITED.
An extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of this company was held on Monday at the Cannon Street Hotel, for the purpose of confirming and rendering special the resolutions passed at the extraordinary general meeting of the company, held on the 24th July, respecting the alteration of the articles of association to allow of new arrangements for the remuneration, &c., of the directors. Mr. Wilberforce Bryant, chairman of the company, presided, and said that he had received from Mr. Bolt, a shareholder, two proxies to vote on the payment to the five directors of 2 per cent. on the whole capital of the company, which meant not less than £8,000 per annum,

and suggesting that 2 per cent. on the dividend paid would be good payment for their services. These proxies would of course be no use unless the matter went to a poll, and he thought that it almost amounted to an insult for a shareholder to make such a suggestion. He formally moved the adoption of the resolution altering the articles of association with regard to the appointment of directors, the managing directors and directors’ remuneration, and the election and retirement and removal of directors. Mr. Studd seconded the motion, which was unanimously agreed to.
