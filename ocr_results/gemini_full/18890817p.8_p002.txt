FLOODING IN DUNDEE.—The flooding on Thursday week has had much more damaging effects than was at first anticipated.
In the district of the docks the merchants' premises were flooded to a depth of from 4 to 6 ft., and men were yesterday employed removing the water.
The main sewers were quite inadequate to carry off the rush of water.
Man-holes in the lower streets were burst open in all directions, and the water rose in many places like a fountain.
All work in Trades Lane was stopped, as well as a saw-mill in Seagate.
Several dwelling-houses were inundated, and the inhabitants had to leave them.
Jute, flax, and sack stores were also flooded, and much damage has been done in that direction.
