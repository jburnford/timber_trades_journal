The debtor explains his failure and debts among speculative building, &c. He had £150 on marriage, and his bad debts have amounted to £300 in two years. The Receiver's observations:—\"The receiving order was made upon the petition of the debtor himself. He has carried on business as a timber merchant in Lower Willow Street, Leicester, since March, 1887. It is the same business that was for many years carried on by his late father, Mr. James Beal, upon the same premises. The father died in November, 1886, and his will contained a direction that his son (the debtor) should have the option of purchasing the stock and other assets of the business, but, as the son had no capital of his own, the option was not exercised, and the house, business premises, plant, and stock were sold by auction by the executors. The debtor took a seven years' lease of the house, business premises, and bought the plant from the purchaser for £200 per annum, and borrowed £200 from his father to start with, in addition to which he received £117 under the will of his father. The liabilities are all trade debts, with the exception of this loan. At the date of the receiving order the Sheriff was in possession at the suit of two creditors, and immediately afterwards the landlord distrained for two quarters' rent due Lady Day and Midsummer, and it has been necessary to pay him out. A proper cash book, and ledger have been kept, but no deficiency account has yet been lodged. The debtor intends to make an offer of composition, but he has not at present lodged any proposal.\nBUTCHER, CHARLES, builder, 11, Avenue, Fulham, S.W.—The receiving order in this case was made on the 16th inst. The accounts have now been furnished, and show liabilities £1,230 11s. 4d., of which £975 is fully secured, and £255 11s. 4d. expected to rank; with assets (surplus from securities) of the nominal value of £104 10s. The debtor states that he has been in business as a decorator for many years, that in September, 1888, with £30 of his own, he commenced a building speculation at Fulham, to which most of his liabilities relate. He attributes his insolvency to his liability (£53) to pay under a judgment in an action for slander brought against him by the petitioning creditor, and to liability, estimated at £100, in respect of another pending action for slander.\nBUXTON, C., carpenter and builder, Athelstone Road, North Bow.—The receiving order in this case was made on the 16th inst., the debtor lately carrying on business at Melville Road, Leyton, and the accounts filed show unsecured debts £125 11s. 3d., and fully secured £175; assets £2. The debtor states that since April last he has been engaged in building four houses at Leyton, which are unfinished, and in respect of which his debts are stated to relate. He attributes his failure to the action of the freeholder, who took possession under the building agreement on 27th June last. The property held by the creditor as security for money advanced is estimated by the debtor, for the purpose of his statement of affairs, at the amount of the claim thereon, but he considers the same to be of much larger value.\nFRUSHER, FREDERICK, builder, Avenue Road, North Finchley.—This debtor has presented a petition in bankruptcy.—Mr. Henry Stanley Smith, solicitor to the Registrar of the Barnet Bankruptcy Court, under Mr. Allen H. P. Stoneham (Official Receiver for the district) has been appointed trustee. The debtor commenced business in September, 1882, and the liabilities are returned at £500, and assets of the estimated realisable value of about £250. The alleged cause of failure is inability to realise or let the property built on bankruptcy.\nJULIAN, RICHARD, builder, Dyne Road, Kilburn, London.—In th[?]",
