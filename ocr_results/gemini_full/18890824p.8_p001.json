  "text": "8 The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT. [AUGUST 24, 1889\n\nFir in Scotland,” published in our issue of November last—not last spring, according to “B. F.”— “British Forester” credits him with having the oldest plantation of Douglas fir in Scotland. Does “British Forester” question this concession? He appears to do so when he says the “statement of the chairman is accepted as being founded on second-hand report,” &c. It is difficult to understand “British Forester” here. The allusion to the chairman’s connection with a “ducal estate” where “Douglas fir had been neither ‘planted nor tested thoroughly’” raises the old suspicion about his state of mind when he wrote. The Douglas fir plantation planted by Mr. M'Corquodale in 1860 belongs to the Earl of Mansfield, not to a duke. In conclusion I would ask “British Forester” to state where he finds Dr. Schlich say the merits of the tree had been overrated. His friend, ‘one of the oldest and most experienced planters of the tree in Scotland,’ comes to a rather untenable conclusion when he says that because it is the fastest grower, Douglas fir is the least durable timber. Because larch exceeds the Scottish pine in rapidity of growth, will “B. F.” and his friend assert that it is less durable than the latter? What do they or anybody know about the durability of the timber of this exotic tree grown in this country? Nothing certain. We should be glad to hear from any of our correspondents who have had experience of the growth of the Douglas fir, and experience of the timber it produces.—ED. T. T.
