OPPENHEIM, R. & CO., timber merchants, late of 885A, Old Kent Road.—The debtors, Albert Hilt and Ralph Oppenheim, who, until recently, traded as above, had a receiving order made against their estate on the 10th July last, and a summary of their statement of affairs has now been issued, together with the observations of the Official Receiver thereon. The accounts of the joint estate show gross liabilities of £4,196 4s 5d., of which £3,905 18s. 3d. are unsecured, assets valued at £2,302 0s. 5d., and including an estimated surplus of £1,670 4s. 11d. from securities in the hands of creditors, and a deficiency of £440 5s. The debtors state that the present partnership was constituted in June, 1888, the joint capital of the firm at that time being £400, and they attribute their insolvency mainly to losses by bad debts through the failure of builders. The Official Receiver reports the books of account to be imperfect, and the affairs and deficiency to be therefore only approximately explained. Creditors hold as security mortgages over certain leasehold property at Shortlands, an assignment of second charges over various leasehold properties at Enfield, Bromley, and Lewisham; also bills of exchange. These securities, with the exception of a mortgage for £871 5s. on the Shortlands property, were assigned on the 22nd June last to Mr. Oppenheim, sen., partly in respect of an antecedent debt, to which extent this transaction appears to have been an undue preference. The separate estate of Hilt shows a deficiency of £80 1s. 8d., and Oppenheim states he has no separate liabilities or assets. The first meeting of the creditors is called for the 4th September, and the public examination of the debtors is fixed for the 8th October.

PICKARD, JAMES, builder and contractor, Whitchurch, Salop.—The first meeting of creditors under this recent failure was held last week at the Royal Hotel, Crewe. The Official Receiver, who presided, said that the creditors had not been supplied with a summary of the debtor's statement of affairs, as it was not complete. The gross liabilities appeared to be £4,569 12s. 5d., and of that the sum of £2,165 5s. 1d. was due to unsecured creditors. The amount expected to rank for dividend against the estate was £2,376 15s. 1d. and there was a net deficiency of £1,217 8s. 9d. The number of unsecured creditors was 123, and the amounts varied from £417 down to 2s. The debtor in accounting for his insolvency, said he had had a net loss on the Lion Lane contract of £494 2s. 2d., and a loss on the Hinford contract of £373 17s. These contracts were under the Liverpool Corporation, and it appeared the contracts had been cancelled, and the Liverpool Corporation were about to prefer a substantial claim against the debtor's estate on account of them. The debtor also said he had had a loss of £40 16s. 7d. on Christ Church contract, Wellington. He added that his gross profits for the year 1886, 1887, and 1888 had averaged £925 13s. per annum, and after paying £14 for clerks and £170 for other labour, he was left with a net income of £51 13s. for himself, and that, he thought, would more than account for his deficiency. Ultimately it was resolved that the following gentlemen should be a committee of inspection and have power to appoint a trustee for the purpose of realising the estate, Messrs. R. T. Smith, W. H. Smith, T. C. Howell, J. W. Green, and — Stainton.

SCOTT & MITCHELL, builders, Boscombe.—This failure came before his Honour Judge Maconochie, at the Poole County Court, upon Mr. Powning, of Salisbury, in behalf of the trustee, applying to his Honour to declare that the business alleged to belong to Scott's wife belonged to the husband. The judge said

that there was not sufficient evidence to show that the wife had distinctly carried on the business in her own name, and gave judgment for the trustee.
