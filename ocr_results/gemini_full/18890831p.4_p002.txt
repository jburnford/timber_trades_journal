SALE OF WOOD.—There were sold by roup, at Balhall, Brechin, on Saturday last, about 300 lots of Scotch fir. There was a good attendance, and fair prices were realised. The principal purchasers were:—Messrs. Ewen, Spalding, Balconnel; Millar, Blackiemill; Stormont, Forfar; Black, Brechin; Smith, Balzeordie; Neil, Balhall; and Peebles, Inchbare.

SAW-MILL WORKMEN'S TRIP.—The workmen (with their wives and families) belonging to the Leith Walk Saw-Mills of John Mitchell & Co. had their annual excursion last Saturday. The company numbered about 180, and they proceeded in vans and other conveyances to the far-famed grounds of Hopetoun House, accompanied by bagpipe and flute musicians. The weather was all that could be desired, the route was via the historical Hawes and Queensferry. At the latter point a halt was made to afford a sight of the great Forth Bridge. Arrived at Hopetoun, an extensive programme of sports, games, &c., was gone through, and at intervals the company were regaled with substantial provision suited to the inner man. The return journey was made by the lovely Dalmeny Road, and home was reached at a seasonable hour, each one more gratified than another with the enjoyable excursion.
