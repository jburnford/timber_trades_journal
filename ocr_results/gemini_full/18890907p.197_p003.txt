BOTT, HENRY, builder, 2, Huntingdon Street, Nottingham.—This debtor's deficiency amounts to £666 18s. 9d., and was caused, it is alleged, by depreciation in house property and trading losses. A meeting of his creditors was held on the 13th inst., at the office of his solicitors, and an offer of a composition was then made, but not accepted, and the debtor thereupon filed his petition. He kept a cash-book and ledger up to about eighteen months ago. He has since kept no books, and has no accounts showing his income or expenditure for the last year and a half.
HARLING, WILLIAM F., of 9, Rodney Terrace, Putney, builder.—The statement of affairs filed in this matter discloses creditors unsecured £1,553 13s. 10d., creditors fully secured £15,281 11s. 3d., and a deficiency of £1,810 0s. 5d. The receiving order was made at the instance of Messrs. Eastwood & Co., Limited, of Lambeth, brick and tile merchants, and Messrs. Messer & Co., of 14, Clement's Lane, E.C., timber importers, the act of bankruptcy being the non-compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice. The debtor has produced a cash book and ledger, but these have only been indifferently kept. The debtor states that a petition for liquidation by arrangement of the partnership estate of "Harling & Bowles" was presented in the London Bankruptcy Court in December, 1882, and an offer of 1s. in the pound was accepted by the partnership creditors. The full amount of the composition was paid to the creditors. The debtor states that he became aware of his insolvency about eight months ago, and has contracted debts since then, which he hoped to pay by the realisation of his properties, and attributes his present position to illness, and inability to realise and let his houses. The following are creditors:—

HILL, REUBEN, builder, Philip Lane, West Green, Tottenham.—This debtor, who had a receiving order made against his estate on the 7th August last, has filed accounts showing fully secured debts £7,996 (the securities being estimated at the value of £11,230), and unsecured debts £2,153 14s. 2d. The stock, plant, &c. is valued at £120, and, providing the securities realise what the debtor values them at, the estate shows a surplus of £1,196. As a matter of fact, the stock, &c. has realised £51 17s. 6d., instead of £120. The list of mortgages on various houses built by the debtor and in course of erection at Islington, Holloway, and Tottenham, the failure is attributed to the action of pressing creditors.
HOLROYD, JOHN, trading as "J. Holroyd & Co.," carpenter and joiner, Morley, Yorkshire.—The statement of affairs filed by this debtor, under a receiving order dated 15th August, shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £346 0s. 8d.; to fully secured creditors, £276; estimated value of securities £95, surplus £19, carried to contra; assets, furniture £20, estimated to produce £10; book debts, good, £3 4s. 6d., and doubtful £5 0s. 10d., estimated to produce £5 5s. 6d.; and surplus from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors £19; total, £32 10s., which thus shows a deficiency of £313 10s. 8d. The following are creditors:—

HOYLE, T.—A petition has been filed at the Dewsbury County Court by a creditor on behalf of Tom Hoyle, timber merchant, roller board, and packing-case maker, Soothill, Batley. The liabilities are £763 8s. 2d., and the assets £578 17s. 6d., leaving a deficiency of £184 10s. 8d. The debtor absconded on the 18th of July last.
HULETT, W. H., builder, Sandmere Road, Clapham, S.W.—The receiving order in this case was made in September, 1887, and the bankrupt applied on Tuesday for his order of discharge. The liabilities expected to rank were returned at £2,183 12s. 3d., but it is stated that proof for £817 19s. 6d. only have been made, and the assets were estimated at £2,081 9s. 1d., but the Official Receiver reports that only £15 17s. 4d. has been realised. Of the assets, £2,081 16s. 3d. consisted of an estimated surplus from mortgaged leasehold properties, and proved to be valueless. The bankrupt began business about 1877 as a builder with £250 capital, and he attributed his failure to his inability to sell or let his houses, and also to depreciation in their value. The Official Receiver reported as offences, the insufficiency of the books, and that in January, 1886, the bankrupt had called a private meeting of his creditors, when they agreed to accept a composition of 5s. in the pound. Mr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Kingsbury for the bankrupt. Mr. Registrar Brougham said it was most important that a trader should regularly and keep proper balance his books accounts, so that he might know how he stood. It appeared, however, that the bankrupt passed his examination so long ago as November 1887, and taking that into consideration, his discharge would now be granted subject to a suspension of three weeks.
KNIGHT, JAMES, builder, Rickett's Street, Fulham, S.W.—The meeting for the public examination in this case was held on Tuesday before Mr. Registrar Brougham. Liabilities, £1,351 16s. 11d., of which £737 17s. 11d. are unsecured, and assets estimated at £127 19s. 11d. Mr. Howell represented the Official Receiver. Upon examination the bankrupt stated that he began business in 1876 with £200 capital. He had lost £600 in bad debts by failure of Ashfold, Whittaker, and others. In July, 1888, he went through his stock and considered that he was then solvent. He had lost £100 by the death of two horses. His wife carried on a separate business as a dressmaker, and he had not given her any money for the purposes of such business. He had not made any profit since 1886. The bankrupt passed his examination.
