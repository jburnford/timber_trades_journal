Ferguson & Co., they have assumed that business-like appearance which is characteristic of the saw-mills of Glasgow. This change is naturally attributable to the efficient management which Mr. Ferguson, from his long experience, both commercial and practical, was able, in his own person, to introduce. With the advantage of a training in such an office as that of Singleton, Dunn, & Co., he could not do otherwise than acquire the best commercial knowledge, and afterwards, for many years, in the Glasgow Saw-mills, under D. McFarlane, he had a splendid school for practical experience. After four years’ control, therefore, of this business, we are not surprised that it now takes a place of some importance in the timber trade of the city.\nAlthough Mr. Ferguson’s long connection with the trade has given him a familiarity with the buyers of both the town and country over a wide district, the situation of the mill amongst the numerous engineering and other timber consuming industries has given\n\nhim peculiar advantages for cultivating a local trade; but his enterprise would not permit of his contenting himself with this, for he seeks successfully to enlarge his business. The yard extends to about two acres of ground, and of this a large portion is covered over by sheds. The mill itself is well planned, and the construction is one of the most substantial possible. The foundations are of a great depth and built of solid masonry, giving the slightest vibration, and securing thereby the best workmanship producible by machinery.\nThe building is 100 ft. by 100 ft., covered by two roofs, and contains of machinery two vertical log frames 30 in. and 22 in., one deal frame, one travelling circular bench, two moulding and flooring machines, small jobbing circular; all by Thomson & Allan. The machinery is driven from below, where a roomy cellar is constructed with a 10 ft. ceiling and plenty of light, and into which all sawdust and waste is deposited, and easily removed to the boiler situated on the same level. The motive-power is provided by a very fine horizontal engine of 50 horse-power, and corresponding with the other very strong, heavy, mason-work foundations, securing perfect action.\nAbove the boiler is a drying stove 50 ft. long, and above the saw-mill itself is a flat store, and in which is also a moulding store, and here also the sharpening shop is situated, where the saws and other tools are kept in proper order. Outside is a powerful steam crane with a 55 ft. jib, having a full sweep of all the machinery and the log piles. There are also several small cranes for the manipulation of heavy pieces of wood throughout the yard.\nWe noticed the sheds were largely filled with timber of the various descriptions suited for engineering and other work, both pine and hardwood, and in rows of racks are filled with pine boards, which are periodically disposed of by public sales, which are conducted\n\nBELL & SIME,\nTimber Merchants & Saw-millers,\nDUNDEE SAW-MILLS,\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of AMERICAN and BALTIC TIMBER of every description.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and White Pine Floorings and Linings.
