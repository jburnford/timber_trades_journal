TRADE REPORTS.
(Continued from page 211.)
SUNDERLAND.
The importations during the past week have been exceptionally heavy, no less than five steamers and twenty-five sailers having come to hand, all for local importers.
All the steamers bring pitwood, of which Messrs. Rayner & Moller import two from Stettin, Messrs. Mitshel, Pedersen, & Co. one, of 250 loads, from Carlscrona, also two from Gothenburg, one for the Lambton Company, and the ss. *Emla*, with usual assorted cargo to order.
The sailers :—Messrs. T. Elliot & Son report two with deals, battens, and boards, one, of 150 standards, from Soderhamn, and one, of 120 standards, from Gefle ; Messrs. Short Bros., two cargoes of oak from Stettin, one of 130 and one of 100 loads ; Messrs. Joseph Thompson & Co., two cargoes deals, battens, and boards, one, of 150 standards, from Sundswall, and one, of 120 standards, from Kemi. The only Quebec cargo to hand this week brings about 1,000 loads of elm, beech, pitch pine, &c., for Messrs. J. & W. Wilson & Sons. The remainder of the imports are all pitwood, of which Messrs. Rayner & Moller report eleven cargoes from various Norwegian and German ports ; Messrs. E. Weiner & Co., two from Norway ; Messrs. R. Thubron & Co., one from Langesund ; Messrs. Mitshel, Pedersen, & Co., one from Konigsberg ; and Messrs. C. Calder & Co., a small cargo of 100 loads of Riga red-wood poles ; there are also two cargoes from Norway to order.
The fixtures brought under our notice during the past week are as follows :—
Hernosand to Wisbech (two small boats), 41s. 3d.
Bjurneborg to Grimsby (450 standards), deals, &c., 35s.
Sundswall to Zaandam, Goalo (500 standards), 40s. per tult.
Nedar Calix to Yarmouth (320 standards), 42s. 6d., deals.
Trade continues very brisk. The deliveries of wood goods during the past month have been the highest recorded for many years.
The London strike is still affecting the local coal trade, the shipment for August showing a great falling off.

BRISTOL.
The wonderfully fine weather we are having seems to give an impetus and brightness to the timber as well as other trades, and our merchants are nearly as busy as they can wish ; it quite exhilarates them and the buyers, who more willingly pay the prices. There are several sailers coming here, and of course the insurance on such cargoes will be considerable, far more than by steamers.
Our imports are rather better than last week. Messrs. Taylor & Low Bros. have the *Bailey*, 865 tons, from Rafso and Hammhalfsen, with about 16,750 bundles slate battens, 3,680 bundles of ceiling laths, and 50,000 battens and deals ; also the *Sostrene*, 490 register, from Drammen, with 71,150 flooring boards and 1,700 battens. The *Nigel* (s) is from Antwerp, with 115 iron girders and 188 iron joists ; and Messrs. Jones & Wainwright have the *Millicent* (s), 762 tons, from Archangel, 7,955 red deals, &c., 8,030 white deals, &c. Messrs. Taylor & Low Bros. have also the *Mabel*, 1,116 tons, from Gefle, with a mixed cargo of 21,514 planed boards and 24,746 deals, battens, and boards ; also the *Ragnar*, 980 tons, at Avonmouth, from St. John, N.B., with spruce.
Messrs. May & Hassell have the *Marietta Braille*, 930 tons, with 28,521 pieces spruce deals, &c., from Miramichi.

CARDIFF.
There has been a falling off in the arrivals of pitwood during the past week, and the prices ex ship have ruled very firm at 16s. 9d. to 17s. Marking a new departure in the trade of this district we have to notice the importation by Messrs. Simkin Bros. into Barry Dock of the first two cargoes of French pitwood per steamship *Moliere*, and steamship *Timare*, and notwithstanding the fact that the dock was not quite ready for importers' requirements in this line, the work of discharging was done in a most efficient manner, and left nothing to complain of. There is no doubt Barry is desti ed

to become a most important factor so far as the importation of pitwood is concerned, as it is evident that the dock authorities intend doing all in their power to cultivate this branch of trade.
In mining timber we have no change to chronicle, the latest sales ruling from 37s 6d. to 38s. f.o.b.
The general state of the timber trade is very good, and saw-mill proprietors can hardly keep pace with the orders pouring in.

NEWPORT.
The timber trade of the port is still busy. The imports for the past week include the *Ashford* (s.), with a large cargo of sleepers for Messrs. Burt, Boulton, & Heywood ; the *Niord*, from Quebec ; and the *Iona* from Stockholm, both with deals, on account of Messrs. T. B. & S. Batchelor. The building trade continues brisk, and large numbers of small houses are being constructed in the suburbs, in addition to the numerous alterations which are being made in the centre of the town. Good progress is being made with the baths, washhouses, and the new board schools. The Alexandra Dock extension is being advanced, the dock walls are rising, and Messrs. Armstrong & Co. have the order for the three pair of gates, which are to be constructed of iron.
Pitwood arrivals have been fair, and prices are quoted at 16s. 9d., 17s. 3d.
Several cargoes of mining timber are discharging, a large portion being sent direct into consumption in the Birmingham and Midland districts.

REVIEWS.
*Electric Lighting for the Million*—(Simpkin, Marshall & Co., London).
Now that electric lighting is in a fair way of being laid on like gas in our dwellings and workshops, the public will desire popular instruction as to the merits of the various systems, their cost, &c., and accordingly we recommend this clearly-written book by Mr. Arthur Frederick Guy, and published by Messrs. Simpkin, Marshall, & Co. at 6d.
*The Scripps League American Working Men's Expedition.*
Mr. Edward Scripps, the president of the Scripps Newspaper League, has organised an expedition of working men to Europe in industrial interests, and the brochure before us gives an account of the scheme, and the biographies and portraits of the members composing We hope their trip will secure for them all the advantages they anticipate from it.
