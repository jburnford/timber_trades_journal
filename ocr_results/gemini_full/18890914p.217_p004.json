ROLLOX, Glasgow.\nTelegraphic Address—“FIR.”\n\nTRADE NOTES.\nThe timber trade of the week has not exhibited the same amount of animation as that which has existed for the previous few weeks. There has been no great weakness, but orders do not seem to have been so plentiful, and deliveries have not kept pace with the numerous arrivals that have come to hand, both to the east and west coast. The numerous transactions that have taken place recently no doubt account for the present falling off, the same cheerful feeling is, therefore, maintained. The continued accumulation of stocks of Baltic goods will tend further to delay any opportunity for securing an advanced scale of retail prices, which with firm freights and extra cost of late imports as the season advances becomes the more felt to be inadequate to leave any reasonable margin of profit; in many cases we hear of orders for certain classes taken at cost price, the only profit derivable being that on the sawing and manufacture.\n\nThe chief arrivals have been to the Clyde several cargoes of Quebec timber, and two or three of pitch pine, and numerous consignments of deals, to Glasgow. The import list to the Firth of Forth is lengthy, including cargoes from Petersburg, Archangel, Riga, and Swedish ports. The stocks have consequently experienced an increase to their already bulky proportions, which are conspicuous at all the ports, including the Clyde, Forth, and Tay. At Grangemouth particularly this causes much inconvenience and expense, the facilities for storage being taxed to the utmost, and at Borrowstounness the heavy pitwood stocks have necessitated every available corner to be utilised.\n\nThe public sales this week at Leith and Glasgow were altogether lacking in enthusiasm. The attendances were fairly good, but exhibited quite an indifference to take part in the proceedings. There were signs at Yorkhill of private business being done after the sale, judging from the number of buyers engaged at the desk.\n\nAt Leith next week John Mitchell & Co. take up Tuesday for their annual sale, when",
