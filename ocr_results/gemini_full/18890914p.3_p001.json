  "text": "SEPTEMBER 14, 1889.] The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT. 3\n\nsiderable portion of the goods had to be withdrawn. For what was sold fair prices were got, and no change can be noted in rates. Besides the deals and battens a good line of floorings and linings found buyers at fairly satisfactory prices. A parcel of kaurie pine was tried, but buyers' ideas of value being only 3s. 3d. per cubic foot, at which the first lot fell, the balance was withdrawn.\n\nTIMBER MERCHANTS' CLERK AND THE AMERICAN CONTRACT LABOUR LAW.—Secretary of the Treasury Windom decided an interesting question arising under the Alien Contract Labour Law. It seems that Irvin & Co., timber merchants, of England, who have a branch house in New York, recently discharged the bookkeeper in the latter house, an American citizen named James T. Watson, and sent over a bookkeeper from the home office, named Edward F. Hennessy, instead. Watson complained to Collector Erhardt, and the result was that when Hennessy arrived here, the collector refused to allow him to land, on the ground that it would be a violation of the Contract Labour Law. An appeal was taken to the Secretary of the Treasury, and he instructed the collector to allow Hennessy to land on giving a bond in the sum of 500 dols. for his return in case it was decided that he came within the prohibitory class. The question was referred to the Solicitor of the Treasury, who gave an opinion that as Hennessy had clearly come to the country under a contract to labour, his landing would be a violation of law. The Secretary coincided in this opinion and instructed Collector Erhardt to compel Hennessy to return to England.\n\nGAZETTE.\nPROTESTED BILLS OF EXCHANGE.\nDUGALD M'CALLUM & JAMES CAMPBELL, builders, Connel, as a firm and as individuals, conjunctly and severally, acceptors.
