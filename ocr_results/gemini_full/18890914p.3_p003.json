Sutherland\n\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTHE DOUGLAS FIR.\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nSIR,—Time did not permit me taking any part in the discussion in your columns on the merits of the Douglas fir. I am very pleased, however, to find that there are still gentlemen with a knowledge of timber and kindred subjects willing and able to discuss the subject practically and in a proper spirit.\nI quite agree with your correspondent “Practical” that the tests have been “too limited” to establish beyond question the strength of this timber, and also that it will not take the place of the larch as timber, but when it is considered in the light of £ s. d., it will exceed the value of the larch in the production of timber, the Douglas fir producing per acre fully double that of the larch, planted in soils and situations suitable to its develop-ment.\nFrom a wood merchant’s point of view, that rule departed from, the Douglas fir is a loss. Commercially, the value of the Scots fir and the larch, looking at these for general purposes, their cry is, give us clean-grown (firs) large trees, and we do not care how soft the quality may be. As the nut is that of the wood of the Spanish chest-nut, so that of the wood of soft-grown oak, so is that of the Douglas fir to the larch ; hence the remark by your correspondent Mr. Wright, when he says he found the “grain very like the Breadalbane larch,” which is perfectly correct. In most cases I have found the heartwood of the Douglas fir very tough, it being used for making riddles for dressing grain, and “sculs” for carrying turnips for feeding stock, and for other root crops, for which purpose I have received 2s. per cubic foot for choice cuts, and 1s. per cubic foot for ordinary cuts a foot diameter and upwards. These sales, however, were limited to fallen trees and thinnings, and cannot be in any way considered as the market value of the timber. I consider this to be so far as my present experience leads me, about 6d. per foot.\nThe late Sir William Stewart, of Murthly, Grantully, appears to have used some thin-nings, or dead wood, of the Douglas fir as fence stobs. These I did not detect till 1887 ; they must have been in the soil for at least twelve years. I found every vestige of the white, or sapwood, gone, except at the very point of the stob, but the heartwood was perfectly sound, hard, with a colour resembling that of dry Spanish brown powder used in the preparation of paints, thus proving two points : viz., the durability of the heartwood and the utter uselessness of the white or sapwood of that tree, except when far under ground. The trees were quite young, as the stobs were round, and from 4½ to 5½ in. in diameter. From one of these I selected a piece for my exhibition collection of specimens of home-grown timber. It must be admitted that the range within which the Douglas fir will grow profitably is infinitely less than that of the larch, but considerably greater than that of the plane. The former by judicious planting will exceed, in a given time, the value of the latter, owing to the quick returns per acre.\nIf planted on suitable soil to 25 ft. or 30 ft. apart, the intervening spaces filled up with larch as nurses, these latter to be gradually thinned out, leaving the Douglas firs the sole occupants of the ground at thirty years, the returns per acre would exceed £250 net at sixty, when the Douglas firs, though not at maturity, would be large enough for profit-able cutting. This may be proved, theo-retically, by a visit either to the Murthly Castle or the Durris woods.\nI hope some others will give their experience of this and kindred trees. It must be always borne in mind that my comparisons are taken on the ground of quantity, and used for ordinary purposes.\nD. F.
