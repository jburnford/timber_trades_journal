Nicholson and Cotterill, timber merchants, Fish Street Hill, and the unsecured liabilities were stated in the accounts at £1,036 5s. 3d. and the assets at £91 13s. 1d.\nMr. F. C. Willis appeared for the trustee, and Mr. Howell for the Official Receiver.\nThe bankrupt in the course of his examination stated that he commenced business as a builder and contractor about twelve years ago, but gave it up for a time.\nHe resumed the business in 1886, working chiefly by contract, and was successful at first, but afterwards lost heavily on some of the contracts.\nHe was unable exactly to say when he first realised his insolvent condition, but was not pressed by creditors beyond July, 1888.\nHis drawings for private expenses averaged from £5 to £6 weekly.\nSome of the rooms in his house were kept locked up, as they contained furniture belonging to his brother.\nWith reference to the plant used in his business, he hired the greater part of it from a retired builder.\nAbout June last he called his creditors together, and during that week he tendered for a contract for £5,000.\nHe did so upon the promise of being financed by his friends.\nHis Honour allowed the bankrupt to pass his examination.\n\nSCOTT, G. and MITCHELL, G. W., builders, Bournemouth.—The sitting for the adjourned examination of these debtors was held at the last sitting of the Pool Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Dickinson.\nThe Official Receiver (Mr. F. A. Dawes) was present.\nUpon their names being called they did not answer.\nThe Registrar, after waiting some minutes, said he certainly did not conceive it to be the duty of the Court to sit there and wait for bankrupts to turn up when they liked.\nThere was no other course open to him but to adjourn the examination *sine die*.\nThe Official Receiver said it rested with the Registrar.\nIf the debtors did not appear it was his (the Official Receiver's) duty to apply for an adjournment *sine die*.\nThe Registrar remarked that the debtors were treating the Court with contempt.\nHe adjourned the examination *sine die*.\n\nSTROUD, A. D., builder, Bournemouth.—At the last sitting of the Poole County Court, before his Honour Judge Maconochie, an application was made to the judge by Mr. Powning, of Salisbury, for the trustee, asking that a certain document, alleged to be a lease, should be declared to be invalid.\nMr. Powning said the lease was blank as to dates and terms, and would be just as void if taken as an agreement.\nHe pointed out that the fact of its being undated was admitted.\nHis Honour therefore granted the application and declared the document invalid.\n\nTORKINGTON, SAMUEL, joiner, builder, and timber merchant, 138, Trafalgar Street, and the Trafalgar Street Saw-mills, Burnley.—This debtor appeared at the County Court, Burnley, on the 22nd inst., for his public examination, and was represented by Mr. Heaton.\nIt transpired in his examination that he started business with a capital of about £68 some fourteen years ago.\nA ledger, cash, and day books had been kept for him by his son.\nWhen he filed his petition he owed £75 for rent, and the landlord distrained for it.\nWas unable to say when he first became aware of his insolvency.\nHe paid his creditors a composition of 5s. 6½d. in the pound about three years ago.\nIn March last year he gave a bill of sale to a Liverpool firm to purchase timber.\nThe examination was ultimately ordered to be adjourned to October 3rd.\n\nWALSOM, JOHN, deal worker and box maker, Satchwell Street, E.—The bankrupt applied on Tuesday to pass his public examination.\nDebts £119 3s. 8d., assets £15.\nHe stated, in reply to the Official Solicitor, that he had been insolvent since 1884, his difficulties being caused by a bad debt of £457 from a customer named Barlow; he was also answerable, in connection with the same person, for £100, which he had to pay.\nBarlow was a trade customer for goods supplied.\nHe had not kept any books, as he was no scholar, and always paid his bills when they came in.\nHe was pressed for a debt of £24, and that brought him to the court.\nSince 1884 he had been working for his wife, and she was the owner of the business.\nHis son-in-law had lent his wife the money to pay for the business.\nThe bankrupt further stated that he had carried on business for about 48 years, and this was the first time he had been in difficulties with his creditors.\nMr. Registrar Brougham ordered the examination to be concluded.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\n\nBANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.\n\nBALDWIN JOHN, wood turner and sawyer, Longhope.\nReceiving Order, September 13.\nFirst meeting, Yew Tree Inn, Longhope, September 26 at 4½.\nExamination, Shire Hall, Gloucester, October 16 at 11½.\nAdjudication, September 14.\n\nBREARY THOMAS, builder, 31, Ampthill Street, Bedford.\nReceiving Order and Adjudication, September 9.\n\nFRUSHER FREDERICK, builder, 7, Avenue Road, North Finchley.\nFirst meeting, 16 Room, 30 and 31, St. Swithin's Lane, September 24 at 11.\nExamination, Town Hall, Barnet, October 16 at 11.\nAdjudication, September 11.\n\nGERRISH WESLEY CHARLES, trading as W.
