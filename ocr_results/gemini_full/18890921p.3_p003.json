WADDELL & Co.\nA case of considerable importance to the timber trade was disposed of by Mr. Sheriff Balfour in the Small Debt Court, Glasgow, on the 29th ult. Messrs. John McKechnie & Son, timber merchants, Shields Road, Glasgow, sued Messrs. McPherson, Waddell, & Co., engineers, Mountblue Works, Camlachie, for the sum of £8 7s. 11d., being the price of a log of plane tree sold and delivered to them on May 27th last. The defence stated was that the transaction was a conditional sale, the log having been sent (the defenders averred) to them on the representation that it was capable of being turned into a 26 in. bole, but on being centred it was found not to be of this size, and was rejected. The pursuers denied these statements, and averred that there had been an unconditional sale. They admitted that they were aware the log was intended for a bole, but they had not guaranteed the size, and the defender had selected and measured the log before he made the purchase. The pursuers also maintained that the defender had not timeously rejected the log. After proof had been led, the Sheriff gave decree in favour of the pursuers for the amount sued for.\nIn pronouncing judgment his Lordship said:—The defenders have, in my opinion, failed to prove that the transaction was a conditional sale, or that the pursuers had given any guarantee. Mr. Waddell, of the defenders' firm, had gone to the pursuers' yard, and after examining several logs, had selected the one in question, after having measured it, so far as the appliances at hand enabled him to do so. In these circumstances his eye was his merchant, and he must be held to have made his selection unconditionally. It has also been proved to my satisfaction that by a well-known rule in the timber trade timber merchants never guarantee the outcome of logs sold for boles. In regard to the question of rejection, even had the defenders been successful in\n\nestablishing that the sale was a conditional one, I hold that they would be liable in the amount sued for, as they had failed to intimate their rejection timeously. Mr. Waddell had called at pursuers' yard about a fortnight after receipt of the log, and intimated the rejection to a boy in their employment. This statement was, however, entirely uncorroborated, and, moreover, I am of opinion that such intimation was not sufficient in the circumstances of this case. In order to entitle them to the advantage of this plea, the defenders were bound to have intimated the rejection in writing, or in some more formal manner than a mere message to an office boy. There is also this further fact, which I cannot leave out of view, that Waddell again called towards the end of July and saw inquiries for plane trees, and, although he mentioned that the former log had not come up to his expectations, he neither then rejected it nor said he had rejected it. The rejection in my opinion, rejection was August 2nd, and as the log had been delivered on May 27th, and could have been centred within a day or so of its receipt, this interval was quite unreasonable, and such as put the defenders entirely out of court on this portion of the defence. I have, therefore, no hesitation in pronouncing decree for the amount sued for, with court expenses.\nAgent for the pursuers—Mr. John Downie, of Downie & Aiton, writers, Glasgow; agent for the defenders—Mr. William Cochran, writer, Glasgow.\n\nHAMILTON MARR & CO.'S SAW-MILL AND PACKING BOX WORKS, GOVAN.\nMR. HAMILTON MARR, the sole partner of this firm, commenced business about twenty-five years ago, originally devoting his attention to the building and joinery trade, his saw-mill being constructed on a small scale to meet the requirements of his own business only, but gradually developing a timber trade from time to time, additions of machinery were found necessary, and the cultivation of the packing-case branch necessitated an increase in the number of saws. The situation is most convenient for the delivery of the rough timber from the wharf being immediately opposite the Yorkhill yards, whence the greater portion of his deals are withdrawn. The saw-mill is a substantial build-",
