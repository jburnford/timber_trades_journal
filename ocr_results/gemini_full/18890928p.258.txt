258 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. SEPTEMBER 28, 1889.

account kept by the bankrupts appear to be a day book and ledger only, of a very meagre character.
The debtors state that they have never taken stock.
It will be observed that the bankrupts have returned their assets as estimated to produce, exclusive of book debts, the sum of £638, and in this amount they include “The Slip,” at the Hard, Brightlingsea, which asset alone is estimated by them as likely to realise £500, but I very much fear that this asset will never realise anything like the amount at which they have returned it.
The debtors informed me at the date of the receiving order that four executions had been levied, and I found the sheriff and also the high bailiff in possession under these executions, which amounted in the aggregate to £138 15s. 1d., exclusive of costs.
The debtors have filed no deficiency account.
Root, has no separate estate or liabilities, but in the joint statement of affairs his wife, who, I am informed, has a separate business of her own, is returned as an unsecured creditor to the extent of £48 19s. 6d. for materials supplied.
This debtor’s son-in-law is also returned as a creditor for £94 5s. 4d. for moneys lent and advanced in the business.
The debtor F. W. Diaper, at his preliminary examination stated that his separate debts amounted to about £150, and that his only assets consisted of furniture valued by him at £30.”

TUTHILL, C., builder, Sevenoaks.—This bankrupt attended, on Thursday week, at the Tunbridge Wells Bankruptcy Court, for his public examination, before Mr. Registrar Stone.
Replying to Mr. A. S. Cully, Assistant Official Receiver, debtor said he once was in partnership with a Mr. Binfield, at Hammersmith.
His capital at starting was £400.
No accounts had been kept.
He had been building property for his sister, who had advanced £310 beyond the value of the houses, and he gave her a second mortgage over some other property he had, as his creditors were pressing him.
Had borrowed £320 from the House Purchase Company, who he designated as “money sharpers,” for he thought he only mortgaged certain property to them, but it turned out afterwards he had sold them, and they took possession of the property, to which he attributed his present position.
He never had any furniture.
The examination was closed.

WHITEING, RICHARD, firewood dealer, Brighton.—The statement of affairs filed shows unsecured creditors £85 15s. 9d., creditors partly secured £766 5s. 10d., net assets £6 15s. 6d., and a deficiency of £245 6s. 1d.
The Deputy Official Receiver’s observations are :— The receiving order was made on September 19th, 1889, and on the same day debtor was adjudicated bankrupt on his own petition.
The bankrupt states that he has carried on business for many years, and at first with success.
He subsequently built the premises, 159, Eastern Road, Brighton, borrowing £200 for that purpose, and he has since borrowed at various times other sums, amounting in all to £400, giving a mortgage on the property to secure these advances and the amount of a current account.
There is no value in the equity of that property.
The bankrupt also states that he had two-thirds share in a fishing lugger, which cost him £205, but that he parted with his interest in it three years ago.
It is, however, scheduled in his statement, although said to be of no value.

TRADE NOTES.
The statistics of imports to date show an enormous increase to the principal Scotch ports, in comparison with the like period of last year, which was also largely in advance of the previous one.
Of sawn wood, the log timber the most prominent port is Greenock, which has 22,000 loads in excess, or fully 50 per cent.
The existing stocks, however, although heavy, do not correspond with this increase, and mark the heavy consumption that has gone on throughout the year.
The increased importations have, consequently, in this case been fully warranted.
The two principal Firth of Forth ports of Leith and Grangemouth are increased by no less than 42,000 loads, and the result that the stocks on hand are also unusually heavy.
The consumption has been extremely good, but far short of the extra supplies provided.
Glasgow is 5,000 loads behind, almost the only exception to the decrease.
Dundee adds 15,000 loads extra to previous supplies, and Montrose 20,000 loads.
The pitwood imports have been increased by no less than 55,000 loads in excess, and the existing stocks are far ahead of any previous period.
It is generally understood that the main shipments of Baltic timber will be much lighter than usual, but this will be necessary to bring the stocks to a normal condition.
The active trade that has been experienced throughout the year demands greatly increased imports; but one-third extra supply, if continued at the same ratio to the end of the year, would, we fear, leave too large a surplus to sustain a healthy condition.
If, on the other hand, the late supplies, as is believed, will be light, the present position of the stocks need give no anxiety, and the fairly satisfactory condition of trade, of which there is every indication of a continuation, will speedily adjust them.
The increase in the Greenock imports is chiefly made up of pitch pine and teak, the yellow pine imports being only increased in small measure compared with last year.
The pitch pine has undergone a wonderful reduction in amount.
The teak stock is, however, still very heavy.
As far as trade is concerned, there is
