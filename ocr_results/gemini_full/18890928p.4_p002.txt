JOHN WOYKA & CO.,
GLASGOW.
THIS well-known firm has been established as mahogany, timber, and veneer merchants since 1873. As far back as 1855, however, the senior partner established himself in Glasgow as a wholesale cabinetmaker, which business he carried on up to this time, and was entirely laid aside in order that he might devote his whole energies to a business which demands and repays energetic application.
Such being the history of its origin, the firm naturally devoted itself principally to supply the wants of cabinetmakers and others using fancy woods and hardwoods, and, owing, no doubt, to the practical experience of the senior partner, have succeeded in securing and retaining an ever-widening circle of business connections in town and country. The veneer trade, which forms a natural adjunct to a mahogany and hardwood business, is made a specialty, and at all times a large variety is to be found here. Particularly is this the case with walnut burrs and mahogany curls.
Their yard is situated in Govan Street, and is chiefly covered in by lofty sheds, where the planks and boards of such woods as mahogany, walnut, wainscot, &c., are stored and undergo the process of seasoning, which in the case of these hardwoods necessitates a lengthened period. The centre of the yard is occupied by timber in the log, but the principal portion of the firm's whole timber is kept at the docks and the saw-mills. Samples, however, of logs are stored in the yard for the convenience of their numerous customers. Amongst the more familiar woods we noticed in their sheds (to enumerate which in detail would entail the occupation of too much space) mahogany, wainscot, walnut, ash, cypress, maple, satinwood, rosewood, birch, &c. These are kept in a large variety of sizes and thicknesses, and in every degree of dryness. Those thoroughly seasoned, being naturally the first sent out, are immediately replaced by fresh stocks, thus maintaining a regular supply, and in order to accurately determine the fitness of the wood for manufacture, judging from time, a record of their storage is carefully kept.
The veneer storeroom of the firm is a place of the greatest interest. In addition to a large stock of veneers, cut and sawn in many rare varieties of wood, there is a large selection of ornamental specimens, among which we were particularly interested in the burr of the Egyptian ash, newly imported to Scotland by the firm, and which, by reason of its beautiful figure and rich creamy colour, bids fair to become a favourite with manufacturers. These rare woods, we learn, are largely used for ornamental furniture and mansions and ships' cabins. The careful and methodical manner in which each variety is kept, and the amount of knowledge imparted by Mr. Woyka on each, bespeak the special study he has devoted to this branch of the business. These ingraineed specimens for decorations are also displayed, as also a new feature in engraving which, instead of being carved, is stamped by prepared steel dies, effectually impressing the wood, leaving the desired figure in perfect form. This system has the great advantage of cheapness, as hundreds of impressions may be made before the skilled carver could be said to have started the work.
Mr. Woyka is ably assisted by his two sons, whose study of the woods belonging to the cabinetmakers' art, and their close attention to business, are factors in its extension, and largely contribute to the success the firm has acquired through its senior partner for so many years, and which, with their power added, continues further to gain.
