It appears that the failure occurred in July, 1887, when the statement of affairs showed liabilities £6,293, and assets £4,955. The assets had produced £4,803, and dividends, amounting to 11s. in the pound, had been paid upon the liabilities, which had been increased to £6,673. The trustee reported that the debtor had rendered every assistance and information in the winding up of the estate, and he had no objection to the discharge being granted. The Official Receiver reported that since the last adjournment the debtor had not only failed to disclose his business and financial position, the cash-book not having been added up nor balanced from the time it was commenced to the date of the receiving order. Ultimately his Honour granted the discharge, but suspended its operation for a month.\nFOSTER, HENRY, builder, Plymouth.—The adjourned public examination in connection of this debtor was held last week, before Mr. Registrar G. Edmonds, at Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court. The Official Receiver (Mr. J. Greenway) represented the Board of Trade, and Mr. J. Ashford appeared for debtor ; Messrs. R. B. Johns (Shelly & Johns) and Watts appeared for creditors. The Official Receiver remarked that since the last adjournment detailed accounts had been supplied by Messrs. Sparrow and R. & R. Bayly and Mr. Baron, who were large creditors. There had been two lengthy meetings between parties interested, and the accounts had been gone into fully. In the interval the debtor had prepared a supplementary account, which differed from the last account considerably, owing to the addition of money received in cash from Mr. Baron, and the detailed account he had had from him showed that £2,000 had been paid to Foster since Messrs. Bond & Pearce, Mr. Baron's solicitors, closed the account amounted to £2,771. Mr. Watts said that since the last sitting debtor had not only found that he had omitted from the accounts £2,000 received in cash from Mr. Baron, but that two books had been discovered which they had never seen before. Debtor, who was under examination for upwards of an hour, explained that the £2,000 had been entirely overlooked, whilst the books which had been found were only small ones dealing with cartages, and which were kept by his late foreman, from whom he had obtained them within the past week. Eventually the Registrar said that the solicitors appearing for creditors were entitled to have an opportunity of investigating the wages and sand account, as well as the item of £2,000 which had been omitted, and for that purpose he should adjourn the examination until the 9th October, on which date he would advise the debtor to come to the Court prepared to answer the questions more satisfactorily.",
