It was but the other day I visited, with a friend, the home of the Douglas fir in this country, where one can see the tree in its glory. We could only make a hurried inspection of the woods, but took sufficient notes of measurements to enable us to calculate approximately the correct amount of timber per acre. The wood was planted 1814-7 with plants about 20 in. in height, reared mostly in pots in a cold frame, planted out from 25 to 30 ft. apart, with silver firs as nurses. The soil on which they are planted is a deep gravelly sand, having only a thin layer of loam. The atmosphere is extremely dry in summer days, often fogs at night, and very wet in winter. By actual measurements and calculation I found about 12,000 cubic feet per acre, and that on soil not worth, from an agricultural point of view, 2s. per acre. Nor could it be at all cultivated except by spade. No doubt what I have quoted is an exceptional case; still there are thousands of acres in this country quite as suitable to produce the same quantity as the part I have referred to.\nWith regard to the progress of the growth of the Douglas fir, as compared with that of the Scots fir and larch, I am enabled, from data before me, taken many years ago by actual measurements, to give it in tabulated form as under, viz. :—\nName of Tree | Age 20. | Age 30.\ndiam. height. | diam. height.\nDouglasii | 7 7/10 in. 34 in. | 14 5/10 in 50 in\nLarch | 6 3/10 \" 30 \" | 11 \" 39 \"\nScots Fir | 5 1/10 \" 28 \" | 10 5/10 \" 34 \"\nNote these diameters are taken one foot above the line of the ground, and the height from the ground level to the top of shoot.\nThe above were growing in the same locality, under the same circumstances, and receiving the same treatment. Now these on rather damp soil of good quality, worth 18s. per acre, are growing the Wellingtonia and Taxodium Sempervirens producing at the rate of about 300 cubic feet of timber in the same period of time, worth 1s. per foot, growing 300 trees per acre, value in 40 years £900. The area, however, is too limited to make this statement of much\n\nIRELAND & THOMSON,\nFOREST TREES.\nASH, SYCAMORE, LARCH, PINE, LARICIO, PINUS AUSTRIACA, ABIES DOUGLASII, BEECH, & THORN.\nWe hold a large and fine Stock of the above in all sizes.\nSamples and Prices on Application.\n81, Princes St., Edinburgh.\n\nCARLISLE.\nLITTLE & BALLANTYNE\nFOR FOREST TREES\nLISTS—POST FREE ON APPLICATION.\n\nB.
