own petition. The debtor states that he commenced business about ten years ago with a capital of £200. He has produced two books, a day and bill book, but they have been very badly kept, and do not show his business transactions and financial position for the three years immediately preceding the bankruptcy. The debtor does not appear to have kept any record of his receipts and payments. The securities held by the creditors fully secured consist of mortgages and second charges on properties at Balham, Wandsworth Common, and Battersea, and the equities of redemption, which the debtor estimates will produce £372 16s. 10d., are, in my opinion, of very doubtful value.
The debtor states that a meeting of his creditors was held about a month ago at the offices of his solicitors, Messrs. Simpson, Palmer, and Winder, 3, Crown Square, S.E., for which a statement was prepared, showing liabilities £1,056 11s. 2d., and assets £435 7s. 2d. An offer of 4s. in the pound was made, but not accepted by the creditors. The debtor states that he made an arrangement with his creditors in November, 1883, a meeting being held at which he made an offer of 5s. in the pound, which was accepted. The debtor also states that the offer was guaranteed, and the amount of the composition was paid to the creditors. The debtor states that he became aware of his insolvency about fifteen months ago, and has contracted debts since then, which he expected to pay by the improvement in house property and by the sale of the same.

POINTER, ROBERT, builder, St. Peter's Road, Earley Rise, Reading.—The statement of affairs filed by this debtor shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £778 1s. 10d., and an estimated surplus of £631 9s. 1d. The receiving order was made on the 12th day of September, 1889, on the debtor's own petition. The debtor states that he commenced business about ten years ago with a capital of £500 (half his own money, and half his wife's). He has produced a day book, cash book, and ledger, which have been indifferently kept, and do not show the business transactions and financial position of the debtor for the three years immediately preceding his bankruptcy. The securities held by the creditors fully secured consist of mortgages and second charges on six freehold houses and twelve plots of ground at Filey Road, ten freehold houses, St. Peter's Road; six freehold houses, Auckland Road; two freehold houses, St. Mark's Road, Maidenhead; also several plots of ground at Earley Rise, Reading. The security held by the creditors partly secured consist of a second charge on the six freehold houses in Auckland Road. The debtor states that a meeting of his creditors was held at the Queen's Hotel, Reading, on the 31st August, when a statement was prepared showing liabilities £700, and assets (including equities in properties) about £1,400. The debtor states that he is not insolvent, and that if his property were put up for sale he could pay 20s. in the pound, and attributes his present position to the action by one of his largest creditors.

SNOW, WILLIAM, builder, and foreman of the London Central Market.—The bankrupt applied on Tuesday to pass his public examination before Mr. Registrar Linklater. He returned his liabilities at £1,488, with assets £27, and attributed his failure to loss through the foreclosure of property in Mare Street,

Hackney, in which he originally had an interest, to legal expenses in connection with it, and other causes. Mr. Aldridge appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Law for the bankrupt. From the evidence it seemed that the bankrupt had for several years been in the employ of the Corporation of London, and he was at present in the receipt of a salary of £4 4s. a week. He had been engaged in building speculations in the name of F. Ernest & Co., and most of his present debts related to that business. In July, 1878, he filed a petition for liquidation, his debts then amounting to £546, and he believed that a composition of 5s. in the pound was accepted, but was not sure that all the creditors received it. The bankrupt passed his examination.

TRADE NOTES.
A fair amount of briskness continues to characterise the timber trade, and although being booked for delivery to arrive, the hands are satisfactory; the stocks, however, still coming forward on a scale. It was hoped that the number of arrivals in September would have, to a great extent, closed the list for some time, but in this we have given disappointment, as the first week of October has been an unusually long list of Baltic Firth of Forth ports. This fact has led to a greater anxiety on the importers to make sales, and although is no weakening of prices, buyers lines are able to make more favou ditions. This continuation of heavy places beyond the hope of real expectation so long held that a prices would be brought about, and causes of so much complaint of of profit would at this season be

The list of imports to the East week is a long one, embracing the principal north of Europe ports. withstanding the good trade and and the healthy amount of deliv excess of the current requirem further adding to the accumula that already exists.
