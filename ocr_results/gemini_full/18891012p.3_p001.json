A considerable quantity of\ntimber was sold, but deals were out of favour,\nonly one lot being publicly disposed of. The\nfollowing prices were realised publicly,\nviz. :—\nWaney boardwood— Per c. ft.\n17in. avg. 1,200 c. ft. per page 1s. 11½d.\n1,100 „ „ 1s. 6d.\n17½in. avg. 736 „ „ 1s. 10½d.\na small lot of 7 logs 1s. 10½d.\n8 logs 1s. 11d.\nSquare yellow pine—\n500 c. ft. per page, short 1s. 5½d.\n700 „ „ „ 1s. 2½d.\n620 „ „ „ 1s. 2d.\n800 „ „ „ 1s. 1½d.\nsmall lot of 15 logs 1s. 4d.\nAsh, 750 c. ft. per page 1s. 11d.\n4th quality pine deals—\n8 to 15ft.—7in. to 11in. x 3in. 9½d.\n\nLEITH.\nThe tide of importation has again flowed\nduring the past week, and a large number of\narrivals are reported. There are no less than\nthirteen entire cargoes of deals and battens,\nbesides a cargo of Windau timber and a large\ncargo of pitch pine timber. The latter is\nfor Messrs. John Mitchell & Co., and seems\na prime shipment, so far as already dis-\ncharged, of Sullivan's timber.\nWith so many arrivals there is a great\npush at the docks, getting the various cargoes\nlanded, and the wet, stormy weather now\nprevalent is interfering very much with\noutside work. The bulk of the goods now\narriving are being stored, the orders from\nship's side being comparatively small. There\ndoes not appear to be the same extent of\n\nlaying in advance of requirements on the\npart of builders and joiners that\nwas seen last year at this time, showing\nthat consumers do not apprehend the rise\nin values which was being anticipated then.\nIf consumers are thus light stocked, and\ntrade keeps satisfactory, there is bound to\nbe a steady consumptive demand during the\ncoming months, which will help to make up\nfor the present absence of large transactions.\nAt Messrs. A. Garland & Roger's sale, on\nTuesday, 8th inst., the company was some-\nwhat long in gathering, but there was ulti-\nmately a good average attendance. The\nbidding was slow throughout, and no large\nquantity changed hands, buyers strictly\nconfining themselves to supplying merely\nactual requirements. Prices ruled very much\nthe same as before, any lots going cheaper\nbeing merely oddments, or small, sample\nlots put up without reserve. For good white\n6½ x 2½ battens 13½d. to 1s. per foot was the\nrule, and 2½d. to 2¾d. for 9 x 3 white deals,\nand the broker kept strictly to his limits.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nOct. 4 Eidboe-Sundswall-1,354 pcs. hewn fir\n1,904 pcs. sawn fir, 54 lds. firewood-G\nMilne & Co.\n5 Eros Nedcrkalix-1,012 pcs. hewn fir, 2,979\nfir battens, 2 lds. firewood, ½ ld. fir boards-\nJ.
