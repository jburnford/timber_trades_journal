OCTOBER 12, 1889.] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT. 3

fairly representative attendance of the trade
in the west as well as one or two buyers from
the east coast. A considerable quantity of
timber was sold, but deals were out of favour,
only one lot being publicly disposed of. The
following prices were realised publicly,
viz. :—
Waney boardwood— Per c. ft.
17in. avg. 1,200 c. ft. per page 1s. 11½d.
1,100 „ „ 1s. 6d.

LEITH.
The tide of importation has again flowed
during the past week, and a large number of
arrivals are reported. There are no less than
thirteen entire cargoes of deals and battens,
besides a cargo of Windau timber and a large
cargo of pitch pine timber. The latter is
for Messrs. John Mitchell & Co., and seems
a prime shipment, so far as already dis-
charged, of Sullivan's timber.
With so many arrivals there is a great
push at the docks, getting the various cargoes
landed, and the wet, stormy weather now
prevalent is interfering very much with
outside work. The bulk of the goods now
arriving are being stored, the orders from
ship's side being comparatively small. There
does not appear to be the same extent of

laying in advance of requirements on the
part of builders and joiners that
was seen last year at this time, showing
that consumers do not apprehend the rise
in values which was being anticipated then.
If consumers are thus light stocked, and
trade keeps satisfactory, there is bound to
be a steady consumptive demand during the
coming months, which will help to make up
for the present absence of large transactions.
At Messrs. A. Garland & Roger's sale, on
Tuesday, 8th inst., the company was some-
what long in gathering, but there was ulti-
mately a good average attendance. The
bidding was slow throughout, and no large
quantity changed hands, buyers strictly
confining themselves to supplying merely
actual requirements. Prices ruled very much
the same as before, any lots going cheaper
being merely oddments, or small, sample
lots put up without reserve. For good white
6½ x 2½ battens 13½d. to 1s. per foot was the
rule, and 2½d. to 2¾d. for 9 x 3 white deals,
and the broker kept strictly to his limits.
