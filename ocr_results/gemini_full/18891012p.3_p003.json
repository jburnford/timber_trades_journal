The front facing the street is of a most pleasing and attractive design, and is occupied as their show warerooms, and the back is devoted to the workshops, branching into the numerous departments that belong to this artistic trade. The ground covered by these buildings extends to nearly 2,000 square yards; the bottom flat is taken up by the saw-mill department, and the sheds for seasoning the large assortment of fancy hardwoods. The machinery at work embrace circular and band saws, planing and moulding machines, driven by steam-power provided by a horizontal engine and semi-portable\n\nJOHN FLEMING & CO.,\nTimber Importers & Saw-millers,\nALBERT SAW-MILLS,\nALBERT QUAY, ABERDEEN.\nTelegraphic Address—\"ALBERT, ABERDEEN.\"\nLargest Stocks in the North of Baltic, American, and Fancywood Goods.\n\nJAMES TAIT,\nBuilder and Timber Merchant,\nSaw-mills,\nPENICUIK.\nSelected Stock of all kinds of Home and Foreign Seasoned Timber, always on hand.\n\nJAMES JOHNSTON,\nTimber Merchant and Saw-miller,\nTHE SHORE,\nSTIRLING.\nTelephone No. 662.\n\n5\nboiler, the whole neatly and systematically arranged. The next flat is used as the cabinet-makers' workshop, in which we find a long array of benches, and furnished with the necessary appliances for the furtherance of the work. One wing of this flat is set apart for upholstering, polishing, and finishing, and in this department a large number of female labourers is employed.\nThe whole of the premises are heated up by water pipes from a furnace placed in the bottom flat. There are a large number of modern machines, such as carpet beaters, hair cleaners, &c., enabling the firm to carry on within themselves every branch of the furnishing trade.\nThe wareroom is what may be described as an art gallery, suites of furniture of every description being displayed to tempt every taste, some of the designs being of the most pleasing and useful kind, and one feature we noticed is that all, or nearly all, the furniture is manufactured from the solid wood, veneer-ing for the present having been discarded. The arrangements which the whole business is carried on bespeak the practical knowledge that is imparted into it by the partners, father and son, and in their new premises it is safe to predict a further development of this growing business.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE\nDOUGLAS FIR.\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nSIR,—Perhaps it may interest you to know the estimate put upon the Douglas fir by our continental friends. German foresters hold that, under proper conditions as regards locality, no tree which has been introduced into Europe during the present century is so worthy of cultivation as this. It demands, above all things, a moist atmosphere, such, indeed, as is obtained on the Continent only in the lower regions of the valleys of the great rivers which flow into the North Sea. In very exposed situations, or in a dry climate, it is quite unnecessary waste of time and money in attempting to induce the cultivation of no tree of the same [?] arid districts of Bohemia [?]",
