PRACTICAL NOTES.

QUESTIONS.
The Ironbark Tree.—I should be glad if you could afford me any reliable particulars as to the above.—ARBOR.

Coke for Saw-mill Boilers.—Can any of your readers say whether it is possible to use coke with sawdust, shavings, &c., for heating boilers?—CARBON.

Log Hauling Apparatus.—Can you advise me as to the best plan for hauling heavy logs into a saw-mill where there is no overhead traveller?—J. T. T., Ireland.

Moulding Stone by Machinery.—I should be glad if you would inform me if there is any machine made for moulding hard stone.—A MERCHANT.

Plane Irons of Solid Steel v. Steel-faced Irons.—Which do you recommend as best, irons made from solid steel or steel-faced?—W. & W.

Grinding Hard Dyewoods.—Can you inform me through your valuable Journal the best machine for grinding hardwoods to a tolerable degree of fineness? I want to grind about two tons per day.—R. A. (Surrey).

Grinding Moulding Irons.—What is the best and most economical plan for keeping large quantities of moulding irons in order, filing or grinding, and, if the latter, which is the best machine for the purpose?—A. J. T.

Drying Stove.—Any information respecting same suitable for a builder's business will be much valued. It is desired to use waste shavings from wood-working machinery for heating purposes, either by having large furnace and brick flue through stove, or to have iron saddle boiler and furnace and hot water pipes above floor.—PUZZLED BUILDER.

Combustion of Sawdust.—We are proprietors of a saw-mill, and have great trouble in getting rid of our sawdust. Can any of your readers inform us of some plan for the profitable combustion of this commodity? We find that not only do we save nothing, but have actually to use extra coal to get rid of it. There must surely be some way of obviating this, as we understand many mills abroad are actually kept going by their dust. If some kind reader will only let us into the secret, we are sure he would be conferring a benefit on many besides.—PERPLEXED.

ANSWERS.
Planing Discs in Saw Benches.—In answer to “W. & Co.,” we do not care for the use of planing discs in saw benches; in fact, comparatively few are now used. If very carefully fitted and balanced, they may be used for rough work, but if they are the least out of balance, or the cutters not of the proper shape, or arranged at the right angle, they are worse than useless. They are used in conjunction with a long fence and binding rollers and levers, but we think you would be well advised to buy a separate thicknessing machine, which can now be bought for a very moderate price.

Veneer Cutting Machines.—In reply to “J. P. C.,” you had better ask a veneer cutter to try samples of the foreign woods you speak of; you would then be better able to judge what system of cutting would suit you best. A variety of machines are made, including one in which the wood to be cut is first of all steamed. It is then held stationary, and a knife with a kind of shearing cut is made to pass over it and take off a slice. Another machine is arranged to cut veneers round the log. It is claimed for this plan that wide veneers may be obtained from small wood, and the figure is uniform throughout the width, instead of being plain in the centre, with a strip of figure each side. It is also claimed that veneers cut in this manner (i.e., round and not across the annular growth rings) can be laid more easily, and settle with a smoother surface than if otherwise cut. In other machines the veneers are sawn either with a reciprocating saw or with a segmental circular saw disc. These latter machines will not, however, cut veneers nearly so thin as the knife machines, but are better suited to some kinds of wood. Before settling you would do well to consult an expert on the subject.
