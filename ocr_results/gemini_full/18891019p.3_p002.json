Grear\n\nACCIDENT TO A GRANTON-BOUND SHIP.—The schooner Reaper, of Peel, Isle of Man, 82 tons register, came into Peterhead on Tuesday dismasted.\nThe vessel left Swinemunde on the 4th inst. with pit props for Granton.\nShe encountered heavy gales.\nWhile lying to last Thursday, 270 miles off the Spaw, a tremendous wave struck the ship, washed overboard the deck cargo, and snapped the forestay.\nThis accident was quickly followed by the breaking of both masts four feet above deck, and the loss of the jibboom.\nThe schooner lay in a totally disabled condition for some time, but fortunately none of the crew were hurt by the crash, and Captain Bird at once prepared to erect jury masts.\nThis was effected next day by the use of the main boom for the foremast and the foreyard for the mainmast, and having set the boom foresail and the jib, they made for the land, with the exception of part of the bulwarks smashed by the falling of the foremast, no damage has been done to the ship apart from the rigging, and with a fair wind they would have been able to reach the Firth of Forth.\nThe schooner will be remasted in Peterhead.\n\nD.
