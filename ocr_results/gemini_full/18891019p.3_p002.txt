ACCIDENT TO A GRANTON-BOUND SHIP.—The schooner Reaper, of Peel, Isle of Man, 82 tons register, came into Peterhead on Tuesday dismasted.
The vessel left Swinemunde on the 4th inst. with pit props for Granton.
She encountered heavy gales.
While lying to last Thursday, 270 miles off the Spaw, a tremendous wave struck the ship, washed overboard the deck cargo, and snapped the forestay.
This accident was quickly followed by the breaking of both masts four feet above deck, and the loss of the jibboom.
The schooner lay in a totally disabled condition for some time, but fortunately none of the crew were hurt by the crash, and Captain Bird at once prepared to erect jury masts.
This was effected next day by the use of the main boom for the foremast and the foreyard for the mainmast, and having set the boom foresail and the jib, they made for the land, with the exception of part of the bulwarks smashed by the falling of the foremast, no damage has been done to the ship apart from the rigging, and with a fair wind they would have been able to reach the Firth of Forth.
The schooner will be remasted in Peterhead.

CHRISTIE & MILLER'S CABINET WORKS, FALKIRK.
WHILE it is a fact that great pains are taken and much expense is incurred in modern furnishing, the present day has lead to the systems whereby the manufacture of furniture can be carried out in a way to combine comfort, convenience, and substantial make, with a regard to economy to meet the popular wants.
The efforts that have been made of recent years, by the aid of mechanical inventions to facilitate and cheapen the manufacture of article have been successful in largely stimulating the demand for the various household commodities, and we find that the furniture and cabinet-making trade is one not only of increasing importance, but in regard to which a revolution has taken place, for instead of the small workshops, giving employment to one tradesman, and, perhaps, the members of his own family, we have now the large factory, giving employment in some instances, to hundreds of hands, and, with the aid of steam machinery, producing work not only vastly in excess of the proportion of former times, but of a more substantial kind, and each item manufactured with a greater degree of precision, and the economy effected in this increased production has correspondingly increased the demand by putting within the popular reach many articles which were hitherto by their cost denied to them.
This recent development of the cabinet making trade is a factor accounting in no little measure for the enormously increased importation and consumption of fancy hardwoods that now takes place.
Amongst the extensive factories now existent are those of Christie & Miller, of Falkirk, which were started in 1875, previous to which for some years Mr. Christie had carried on the business of retail furniture formerly established by his father, but which is now given up.
The works extend to an area of about an acre of ground, chiefly covered over by lofty and commodious stone and brick buildings divided into two sections, one of which forms the cabinet factory, where the wood is prepared and the articles of furniture manufactured, the other being used as a warehouse and the various finishing shops.
The factory is four storeys in height, the ground flat being used as a sawmill, where
