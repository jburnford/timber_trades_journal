TRADE NOTES.
A good and healthy demand for most descriptions of wood has existed during the week, and the deliveries have been very satisfactory. These, being practically drawn from yarded stocks, cannot fail to have a pleasing effect on stocks, and though not as yet extensive enough to make an impression, they are all in the right direction, and it will only require a few weeks' continuation of the same condition to reduce the position, when a firmer attitude may be maintained with confidence. The weakening effect created by the accumulation of stocks is gradually being removed by the lightness of the imports this month, and the strengthening of the belief that comparatively small imports of Baltic goods will come forward before the close of the season, and the present prospects of general trade point to a reasonable expectation that the stocks, although apparently large, will be very little more than meet the extra requirements that will be demanded by the healthy trade.

The number of arrivals for the week shows again a falling off, and this has given an opportunity of clearing up the quays at the shipping ports. The American steamers, however, continue to bring considerable consignments of deals to the Clyde, and the stocks incline to accumulate, producing a tendency on the part of buyers to hold aloof. There seems no undue anxiety on the part of importers to force a market, their firm attitude being maintained. The consignments must now shortly cease, which will be productive of a good effect; and considering that we are so near this period, and the general good trade of the country, with every prospect of its continuing, there seems no necessity for importers relaxing from their firm position.

The public sales of the week have exhibited a rather lively condition, the attendances having been unusually large, and, although at least in one case, the transactions were not so numerous, there still was a strong disposition to buy, the failure evidently resulting from the firm attitude of the disposers. The Dundee sale was productive of a large turnover. There is no doubt that importers are highly warranted, in presence of a large attendance.
