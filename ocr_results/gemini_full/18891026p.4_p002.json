Thursday 21st\nTHE SCIENCE OF FORESTRY.\nTHE opening lecture of the newly instituted course of lectures on forestry in connection with the Edinburgh University was delivered by Dr. Somerville.\nThere was a large attendance of Professors and other visitors, conspicuous among whom were the Council of the Arboricultural Society.\nSir William Muir, Principal of the University, presided, and introduced Dr. Somerville as an old University student, of whose brilliant achievements they had all good reason to feel proud.\nDr. Somerville, in opening his lecture, referred to the great attention that was paid to forestry in Germany, India, and other countries, and showed how the State forests in these countries were made an important source of revenue to the State, and had a most important bearing on the welfare of the nation.\nHe then proceeded:—It is undoubtedly true that we have lost much through the scarcity of our State forests, for had they been present in greater numbers the regrettable condition of many of our private woodlands would not now have existed.\nThis would have been a great gain to the country in general; but if the same improvements could have been brought about by other means than the extension of Government forests, the gain would have been still greater.\nThe experiences of other nations, however, tend to show that no other means have ever had very much effect.\nIt is true that we have always managed to get along with a very minimum of State interference and example, and undoubtedly the independent spirit which has thus been developed has stood us in good stead in carrying us over many difficulties.\nBut the peculiar conditions and circumstances con-\n\n5\nsequent to the ownership of forests, all being in a more favourable position to make the best use of land stocked with trees than the private individual can be.\nIt is a great question, and one whose various ramifications would lead us far beyond our limits of time.\nSuffice it to say, the experiences of political economists point to the conclusion that, although the State makes an excellent forester, it proves a bad farmer, it is altogether from the purely economic bearings of the case, many circumstances may be present to compel a State to interfere with forest management, in order to secure the public welfare.\nExtensive denudation near the head-waters of rivers has often been followed by destructive floods, affecting not only the owners of the cleared areas, but the inhabitants of districts situated, it may be, a hundred of miles away.\nThis has been strikingly exemplified in many parts of Austria, where the wholesale removal of trees from large areas in the Tyrol, without any steps being taken to re-stock them, has resulted in widespread inundation and immense loss of life and property.\nThe cause of these Austrian floods has, within recent years, been made the subject of Government inquiry, with the result that the State has purchased large areas of private land in the Tyrolese valleys, in order to preserve the existing forests and to restore those which have been spoiled.\nAmerica can also furnish many cases of flooding following denudation, and in Garden and Forest of 25th September Mr. Harrison connects the recent appalling disaster in Pennsylvania with the irrational management of the forests there.\nBesides the dangers of inundation, those arising from avalanches are also increased by denudation, and many valleys in Switzerland, the Tyrol, and the north of Italy are only comparatively safe through the preservation of large masses of wood on the mountain slopes.\nIn these cases, and many others which will readily occur to your minds, State interference in the management of forests is entirely justifiable on the grounds of public safety.\nNone of them, however, apply with much force to our own country.\nAt one time the maintenance of a supply of oak for the navy was a question of great national importance, but is now only historically interesting.\nIt would thus appear that in this country the\n\nBELL & SIME,\nTimber Merchants & Saw-millers,\nDUNDEE SAW-MILLS,\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of AMERICAN and BALTIC TIMBER of every description.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and White Floorings and Linings.\nAlso large Stocks always on hand of dry Oak and Wainscot Flooring, and Pitch Pine Floorings and Linings, Mahogany Counter-tops, Mahogany, Cypress, Teak, Wainscot, Greenheart, and all kinds of Fancy Woods.\nMOULDINGS supplied to any pattern.\nTelegraphic Address—\"BELSIM,\" DUNDEE.\n\nA. & W.
