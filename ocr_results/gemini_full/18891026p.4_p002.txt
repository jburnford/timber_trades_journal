THE SCIENCE OF FORESTRY.
THE opening lecture of the newly instituted course of lectures on forestry in connection with the Edinburgh University was delivered by Dr. Somerville.
There was a large attendance of Professors and other visitors, conspicuous among whom were the Council of the Arboricultural Society.
Sir William Muir, Principal of the University, presided, and introduced Dr. Somerville as an old University student, of whose brilliant achievements they had all good reason to feel proud.
Dr. Somerville, in opening his lecture, referred to the great attention that was paid to forestry in Germany, India, and other countries, and showed how the State forests in these countries were made an important source of revenue to the State, and had a most important bearing on the welfare of the nation.
He then proceeded:—It is undoubtedly true that we have lost much through the scarcity of our State forests, for had they been present in greater numbers the regrettable condition of many of our private woodlands would not now have existed.
This would have been a great gain to the country in general; but if the same improvements could have been brought about by other means than the extension of Government forests, the gain would have been still greater.
The experiences of other nations, however, tend to show that no other means have ever had very much effect.
It is true that we have always managed to get along with a very minimum of State interference and example, and undoubtedly the independent spirit which has thus been developed has stood us in good stead in carrying us over many difficulties.
But the peculiar conditions and circumstances con-

sequent to the ownership of forests, all being in a more favourable position to make the best use of land stocked with trees than the private individual can be.
It is a great question, and one whose various ramifications would lead us far beyond our limits of time.
Suffice it to say, the experiences of political economists point to the conclusion that, although the State makes an excellent forester, it proves a bad farmer, it is altogether from the purely economic bearings of the case, many circumstances may be present to compel a State to interfere with forest management, in order to secure the public welfare.
Extensive denudation near the head-waters of rivers has often been followed by destructive floods, affecting not only the owners of the cleared areas, but the inhabitants of districts situated, it may be, a hundred of miles away.
This has been strikingly exemplified in many parts of Austria, where the wholesale removal of trees from large areas in the Tyrol, without any steps being taken to re-stock them, has resulted in widespread inundation and immense loss of life and property.
The cause of these Austrian floods has, within recent years, been made the subject of Government inquiry, with the result that the State has purchased large areas of private land in the Tyrolese valleys, in order to preserve the existing forests and to restore those which have been spoiled.
America can also furnish many cases of flooding following denudation, and in Garden and Forest of 25th September Mr. Harrison connects the recent appalling disaster in Pennsylvania with the irrational management of the forests there.
Besides the dangers of inundation, those arising from avalanches are also increased by denudation, and many valleys in Switzerland, the Tyrol, and the north of Italy are only comparatively safe through the preservation of large masses of wood on the mountain slopes.
In these cases, and many others which will readily occur to your minds, State interference in the management of forests is entirely justifiable on the grounds of public safety.
None of them, however, apply with much force to our own country.
At one time the maintenance of a supply of oak for the navy was a question of great national importance, but is now only historically interesting.
It would thus appear that in this country the
