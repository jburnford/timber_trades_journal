It being shown that he had complied with the order made on him to furnish an amended deficiency account, he was allowed to pass, subject to filing the usual affidavit of full disclosure.\nBECK, JAMES, the younger, builder, Maxilla Gardens, North Kensington, W.—Under a receiving order made in this case on October 3rd accounts have now been furnished showing liabilities £751 8s. 1d., of which £500 is due to a building society, stated to be fully secured on two leasehold houses at Notting Hill. Assets estimated at £96 2s. The Court has made an order for summary administration, and the debtor has been adjudged bankrupt.\nBOTT, HENRY, builder, 2, Huntingdon Street, Nottingham.—This was the public examination of the above, who appeared before his Honour Judge Bristowe at the County Court, Nottingham, upon accounts showing liabilities to unsecured creditors £1,693 6s. 9d. and assets estimated at £966 8s., which shows a deficiency of £666 18s. 9d. In his examination the debtor said he commenced business in partnership with James Wright nine years\n\n369\nago under the style of Bott & Wright. The partnership was dissolved four years ago, and the debtor traded by himself. He kept a cash book up to eighteen months' ago, but had since kept only a bank book. Had not been lately engaged in business to such a large extent as previously. He commenced business with a capital of about £70, and when the dissolution took place he paid Wright £675 for the latter's share in the concern. On the 16th August a private meeting of his creditors was held at his solicitor's office, and he offered a composition of 15s. in the pound. At the first meeting under the present failure he submitted an offer of 6s. in the pound. Upon the two dates named his estate was not substantially the same. In the interval between the two meetings his mortgagees had entered into possession of his property, and had taken it out of his hands. He was unable to raise more money, but tried to do so. After being further examined, the examination was ordered to be concluded.\nBRAMHALL & BISSELL, builders, King Street, Warrington.—From the Official Receiver's report on this case it appears that the debtors stated that they commenced business in March, 1886, as builders, in King Street, Warrington. Neither of them had ever had any capital. Bramhall commenced business originally in Mill Lane, off Lovely Lane, as a builder, about 1877, in partnership with E. D. Fogg, the firm being styled Bramhall & Fogg. After two or three years, owing to the defalcations of the cashier, they failed. Bramhall then started on his own account, but six months afterwards, owing to his having no capital, he failed again. From that time to 1886 he worked as a journeyman. Bissell stated that he was never in business prior to 1886. The bankrupts further stated that although they only suspended payment of their debts shortly before the date of the receiving order they first became aware they were insolvent last Christmas, and they admitted contracting debts with a knowledge of their insolvency, adding, \"We hoped to recover our position.\" There was a deficiency of £751 1s. 10d., made up as follows:—Bad debts, £27 7s. 11d. ; difference between cost and present value of stock and plant, £90 2s. ; cost of wall, sewer, drains, and water service in Wellfield Street, estimated at £25; and the rest, £586 11s. 11d., the debtors could only account for by loss in building seventy-three houses through want of capital to buy on the best terms.\nFOAD, CEPHAS, builder, West Cliff, and High Street, Whitstable, Kent.—The following are the principal creditors under this recent failure :—\n£ s. d.\nBroadbridge & Port, Canterbury ... ... about 43 18 4\nBrooks, Phillips, & Co., London ... ... „ 62 0 8\nCollard Douglas, Canterbury ... ... „ 36 8 9\nCox W.

The debtor commenced business in 1882 with a capital of £30, afterwards entering into a partnership with Mr. F. Bowles of Putney, and trading under the style of Harling & Bowles. In December, 1882, a petition for liquidation in the London Bankruptcy Court, when an offer of one shilling in the pound was made and accepted by the creditors. The liabilities in the matter amounted to £17,544 11s. 8d., expected to rank £1,851 3s. 7d., and the deficiency £1,810 0s. 5d. The public examination was concluded.\nJAMES, T., builder, Northwold Buildings, and Amherst Park, Stamford Hill.—The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The total liabilities were put down at £88,653, of which £85,349 are fully secured, and £3,230 expected to rank, the assets being estimated at £985. The following appear as creditors :—",
