INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION, EDINBURGH, 1890.
In 1886 the third and greatest of a series of very successful international exhibitions was held at Edinburgh, and we have now received the prospectus of an exhibition on a still more extensive scale than any of its predecessors, which is to take place in 1890. The exhibition as formerly is under the patronage of Her Majesty the Queen, and the Marquis of Lothian, Secretary of State for Scotland, is the president. The vice-presidents include the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, the Lord Provost of Glasgow, the Lord Mayor (elect) of London, Mr. Edison, the great inventor, and Sir John Fowler, the engineer of the Forth Bridge. The chairman of the executive council is Sir Thomas Clark, Bart., ex-Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and of the London committee, Sir George Hayter Chubb. The executive have secured a site of about 90 acres in extent, within easy walking distance of the centre of the city, and possessing the very exceptional advantages of railway stations belonging to the two great Scotch railway lines (the Caledonian and North British), within the grounds, thus enabling passengers from all parts of the kingdom to be set down within the exhibition enclosure. Tramway lines also run to the entrances, and a canal, to be utilised for the conveyance of visitors, skirts the grounds. The extent of the ground will enable ample space to be devoted to outdoor and indoor entertainments of all kinds, and the utmost attention will be given to this essential part of the undertaking. It is anticipated that the opening of the Forth Bridge (the greatest engineering work in the world) early in 1890 will attract numerous visitors, and these, added to the great stream of tourists, &c., will no doubt ensure a success still greater than that achieved in 1886. The exhibition will include electrical engineering, general inventions, industries, and fine arts. It is proposed to close the list of applications on 1st December, 1889, the space at the disposal of the council being already very largely applied for. A great number of the most interesting exhibits now at Paris will be shown at Edinburgh, including samples of the extensive and unique collection of Mr. Edison, who also shows his interest in the exhibition as one of the vice-presidents. Exhibitors will appreciate the facilities which will be afforded them probably for the first time in the history of exhibitions of having their exhibits conveyed by rail direct within the exhibition grounds. The classification comprises twenty-two sections, and of these six belong to electrical engineering and fourteen to general inventions, and industries, with special sections for women's and artisans industries. There is also a separate section for fine arts. The general manager is Mr. Lee Bapty, whose name is a guarantee for efficient management and attention to the interests of exhibitors.

FIRE AT POLMADIE—DAMAGE, £2,500.
A fire of a most destructive nature broke out about half-past seven o'clock on Saturday evening in the saw-mills, Polmadie, occupied by Messrs. Archibald Hood & Co., Limited. The buildings, which occupy about half an acre of ground, are situated on a bye-road, running eastwards from Polmadie Road, and stand close to the main line of the Caledonian Railway, about a mile west of Rutherglen station. Flames were first seen issuing from the vicinity of the drying stove, and in a short time the saw-mill, which was about 50 ft. broad and 70 ft. long, was wholly enveloped in flames. The alarm was raised, and Crosshill Brigade was immediately on the spot, rapidly followed by Govanhill Brigade with pipe carriage, &c., while the Glasgow Brigade under Lieut. Muir, arrived about eight o'clock. As it was now useless to attempt to save the building, steps were at once taken to prevent the fire spreading to the adjoining buildings. The roof of the saw-mill soon fell in, and valuable timber, machinery, &c., were consumed up in the centre of a huge burning mass, while the piles of loose timber blazed outside. About ten o'clock it was seen that the efforts of the brigade had enabled them to get the fire under control. The Glasgow Brigade did not leave the place till nearly two o'clock on Sunday morning, while the suburban brigades remained for six hours later. Little or no damage has been done to surrounding buildings. The damage is estimated at £2,500, and is covered by insurance.
