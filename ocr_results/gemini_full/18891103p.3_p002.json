[NOVEMBER 9, 1889.\n\nTHE SCIENCE OF FORESTRY.\n(Continuation of Dr. Somerville's opening lecture at Edinburgh University.)\nA FOURTH factor that has exerted, and is still exerting, an important influence upon our system of forestry is game. There can be no doubt about this being the factor whose modifying influence is most felt at the present time; that of the others may be more powerful, but is less apparent. In the first place, the presence of ground game, to a large extent one almost always meets with in our woods and forests, precludes any great hope of success attending attempts at the natural regeneration of our woods and forests, or their artificial regeneration by sowing. Perhaps this is not universally true, but one meets with very few exceptions. One need not go the length of saying that the renewal of woodlands by natural or artificial sowing is always, or even generally, the best method to adopt; but where circumstances interpose to prevent these methods being employed in cases where they would otherwise be considered advantageous, then, of course, action is hampered, and ultimately some other system must be adopted, which, had the conditions been otherwise, would have been considered quite inferior. Where practicable, the natural regeneration system is the most rational and economical system, and gives the best results.\nI will not encroach upon your time by adducing figures to prove that timber yielded by naturally renewed forests is better than that yielded by those which have been artificially planted; but one or two reasons may be indicated to explain why it is so. When the parent trees are mature and healthy very large quantities of seeds are annually or periodically, far more indeed than are actually required for restocking the ground.

To the shading of the ground is to be attributed an increase in moisture and nitrification is hardly of less importance in forestry than in agriculture. To show the effects upon tree growth, which a more or less complete shading of the ground produces, a greater than would be considered necessary by those who had not watched the results, but which is a matter whose importance is fully appreciated on the Continent, where no system of the whole management of forests is more insisted upon than the preservation of a dense and umbrageous covering. In the management of the life of a forest this is not so difficult to accomplish, but in the earlier period before the young trees have closed in on each other, as well as in the later period, when intensive thinning has taken place, the object can only be completely, and at the same time profitably, shaded by the process of natural regeneration.\nProfessor Marshall Ward, in a recently published work, mentions a case which came under his observation two years ago in the district of Freising, in Bavaria. It was a larch plantation about seventy or eighty years old. Twenty years ago the trees of this plantation were showing unmistakeable signs of lack of vigour—that is to say, they were making little growth and were assuming a stunted appearance. Now, as is well known, the larch has a comparatively small mass of foliage, and therefore cannot shade the ground to the same degree as many other trees. In the plantation in question the plan was adopted of thickly stocking the ground with young beeches, and this succeeded so well that now all signs of premature ripeness in the trees have disappeared, and a new lease of life seems to have been granted to the plantation. Scarcely less important than the shading of the ground is the shading of the lower parts of the stems or boles of the trees, for, by this means, the undue formation of the inferior wood which is first produced in a growing season is prevented. By the ordinary methods of cultivation adopted in this country, the young trees pass the first fifteen or twenty years of their life in a semi-isolated condition—that is to say, about that number of years is necessary to enable the trees to close in on each other. During this time the influence of the sun on the lower parts of the stems and on the roots makes itself felt much sooner in each season of growth than would be the case were the stocking thicker, and a close forest or plantation earlier obtained. By this means an undue development of the so-called “spring zone” in the annual wood rings is brought about, and consequently the average specific gravity and quality of the resulting timber are much lowered. In addition to this, the trees do not possess such straight boles; the wood contains a much greater number of knots, especially those of the most undesirable ones called “loose knots”; and the annual wood-rings are very much broader towards the centre than they are towards the periphery of the stems, and this condition, for many purposes, reduces the value of the timber, besides predisposing it to ring-shake. Where practicable, the best means which can be employed to attain the desirable closeness in the early stages of the life history of a wood or forest are to be found in well-arranged systems of natural regeneration, or in artificial sowing. The much greater expense inseparable from the operation of stocking the ground as closely by planting as can be done by natural or artificial seeding, can never allow the former to be carried out with much hope of a profitable return. Of course, it need hardly be said that more careful attention must be given in its earlier stages to a naturally renewed wood, or to one renewed by sowing, than to an artificially planted one, or otherwise the closeness of the young trees, which is so desirable in many ways, may prove to part.\n\nBELL & SIME,\nTIMBER MERCHANTS,\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of AMERICAN and BALTIC TIMBER.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and White Wood Flooring, Wainscot Flooring, and Pitch Pine Flooring, Teak, Greenheart, and all kinds of Hardwood.\n\nA. & W.
