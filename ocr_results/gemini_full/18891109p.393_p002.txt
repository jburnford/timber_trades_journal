TRADE NOTES.
The trade shows no change of a special nature, the position remaining very much the same as has existed for some weeks past. It may be expected from a shorter day to be equally brisk, there is a shortening of the turnover. It is now pretty clearly seen there will be, at least, no fresh timber before next spring; this absence of abundant supply consequently actuates consumers in deferring speculation beyond immediate current wants in hopes of a weakening of the prices may ere long take place, and in adopting this attitude they have considerable justification from the action of importers in so early reducing the market to its present level; fortunately, however, general trade is good, and at present the prospects of its continuation do not favour a realisation of the weakening tendency anticipated by consumers.
The imports are this week unusually light, which will go further to mitigate the effects of any downward tendency that may be created; hopes are so far confirmed by the lightness of the later imports. Constant working on existing stocks will, however, speedily have a beneficial effect, and with a restoration of confidence that prices will be maintained orders by consumers will be more freely given for prospective as well as current wants, thereby facilitating a reduction to normal proportions. The firm stand taken by importers at the public sales induces the strong belief they hold of their view being realised, which their determination will certainly assist.
AT Yorkhill Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchell announce a very important sale for the 20th first; the catalogue is a large one, and many of the items that will attract attention. A fine parcel of birch now landing from Quebec and the cargo of 3rd pine deals ex *Quebec* are deserving of special notice. In addition to these a very varied assortment of Quebec spruce deals will also be offered, with cargoes of States walnut 1st and 2nd quality, and other hardwoods. We anticipate a very sale a large turnout of the trade.
