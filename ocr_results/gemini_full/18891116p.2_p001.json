Mr. John Jessiman announces a sale for Tuesday first, and we anticipate like satisfactory results.\n\nGLASGOW.\nThe arrivals here during the past week have been light; they comprise U.S. walnut and whitewood logs, oak planks, staves, &c., and a few small parcels of Quebec deals.\nThe steamers are making their last trip from Quebec and Montreal for the season, only one or two more being now expected, and these will then be put on the trade to the U.S. ports.\nThe Lord Lansdowne (s), from Baltimore, has just arrived, and brings a large lot of oak planks for railway waggon building, together with whitewood logs, &c., consigned to Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.; also oak planks for Messrs. James Kennedy & Co.\nThe trade in oak planks (for railway purposes chiefly) has been a rapidly increasing one, and during the current year the imports have been heavier than usual (upwards of 100,000 pieces), and the parcels as they arrive per steamships have been delivered as a regular thing into the hands of consumers ex quay in implement of contracts made with the railway companies.\nMessrs. Edmiston & Mitchells had a large and attractive catalogue to submit to the trade for the sale at Yorkhill Wharf and Queen's Dock on 14th inst., comprising Michigan, Quebec, and Miramichi pine deals, Lower Port birch, States walnut, &c., and from the outset a very numerous company was present.\nThe Pictou, N.S., birch timber ex Ashantee was afterwards exposed at Queen's Dock; also a parcel of prime States black walnut mark, recently landed. The divergence, however, between the ideas of buyers and sellers as to\n\nTimber Merchants & Teak Importers\nRailway Wagon and Carriage Oak Scantlings.\nAll dimensions from 22 to 70 ft. long, 3 to 18 in. diam., always in stock.\nvalues was a hindrance to business being done, and these goods were withdrawn.\nFor the Lower Port birch timber, which has been scarce here, offers were from 1s. 7d. to 1s. 10d. per cubic foot for pages of 15¼ in. to 16 in. average respectively, but the brokers' limits were higher.\nThe sale began at Yorkhill with the deals, but the company showed little disposition to buy, and the going over of the catalogue failed to elicit satisfactory competition except for a few lots.\nPer c. ft.\ns. d.\nQuarter 1st pine—\nQuebec 1st pine—\n12/29 x 3 2 4½\n11 x 3 2 3\n7/10 x 3 1 11\nQuebec 2nd pine ex Tropic (s)—\n12 x 9 x 3 1 5\nQuebec 3rd pine—\n10 x 3 1 1\n11 x 3 1 3½\n13ft. 11 x 3 1 3½\n12ft. 11 x 3 1 3½\n6/8ft. 7/12 x 3 1 0½\nQuebec 4th pine—\n(4 lots) 9½d. to 0 10½\n\nGREENOCK.\nOnly one timber cargo came to hand during the week, per Caledonian, from Quebec, with the usual varied assortment, consigned to Cousland, & Co.\nThe James Watt Dock presents a very busy appearance with the discharge of this and the numerous arrivals reported in our last issue, as well as the general shipping business carried on there.\nA moderate amount of business is being done, and prices remain practically steady, but we do not think, however, this is all that should be desired. In face of the large and steady advances in the values of coal, iron, &c., timber should not remain stationary; and it would not do so if a more discerning and judicious policy were pursued in the adjustment of supplies to demands.\nWe understand that Messrs. Caird & Co., shipbuilders, Greenock, have secured an order for two steamers, of 360 ft. each, for an Amsterdam firm.\nMessrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co. will hold a sale here on the 21st inst.\n\nLEITH.\nThe arrivals of wood goods this week are unimportant, comprising merely a sailer of battens from Hernosand, a cargo of firewood from Nederkalix, and some steamer parcels of deals and battens from Cronstadt, in addition to the usual oddments of staves, hoops, &c.\nWith the fine, open, dry weather building operations are not being interfered with, and a fair trade is doing from the docks and yards for the time of year. With the nearly completed, and the large outlet for wood required for the Edinburgh Exhibition of 1890 in prospect, there is better feeling among importers here, which will tend to greater firmness in prices owing to the Martinmas term falling this week there has been no public sale, but sales are already announced for the two succeeding weeks.\n\nSERIOUS FIRE AT FAIRFIELD SHIPBUILDING YARD.—A serious fire occurred at Fairfield Shipbuilding Yard, Govan, on Tuesday the 12th inst. The outbreak took place in the oakum store, a shed 78 ft. long by 24 ft. wide, which was completely destroyed, along with a portion of the plumbers' shop, in which a large quantity of goods and woodwork was seriously damaged before the Govan fire brigade succeeded in arresting the flames. The damage is estimated at fully £3,000.\n\nNOVEMBER 16, 1889.] The Timber Trades\nCitizen Buildings,\n24, St. Vincent Place, GLASGOW.\nAnd 4, Chester St., EDINBURGH.\nTelegraphic Address—\"SIAM.\"\nFLEMING & BARRY,\nCAMPERDOWN SAW-MILLS, DUNDEE.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nNov. 11 Clutha-Rotterdam-1,000 bdls. hoops-R.
