TRADE REPORTS.
DUNDEE.
A steady, active trade is still experienced, and a cheerful outlook exists for the future.
The arrivals have now almost ceased, and with the exception of some small consignments the only large cargo arrived during the week has been the Joseph with battens from Rafso for Bell & Sime.
Fleming & Barry held a public sale on Thursday last, at which a very satisfactory amount of business was transacted; the prices for the various items were practically unchanged. Mr. John Jessiman announces a sale for Tuesday first, and we anticipate like satisfactory results.

GLASGOW.
The arrivals here during the past week have been light; they comprise U.S. walnut and whitewood logs, oak planks, staves, &c., and a few small parcels of Quebec deals.
The steamers are making their last trip from Quebec and Montreal for the season, only one or two more being now expected, and these will then be put on the trade to the U.S. ports.
The Lord Lansdowne (s), from Baltimore, has just arrived, and brings a large lot of oak planks for railway waggon building, together with whitewood logs, &c., consigned to Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.; also oak planks for Messrs. James Kennedy & Co.
The trade in oak planks (for railway purposes chiefly) has been a rapidly increasing one, and during the current year the imports have been heavier than usual (upwards of 100,000 pieces), and the parcels as they arrive per steamships have been delivered as a regular thing into the hands of consumers ex quay in implement of contracts made with the railway companies.
Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells had a large and attractive catalogue to submit to the trade for the sale at Yorkhill Wharf and Queen's Dock on 14th inst., comprising Michigan, Quebec, and Miramichi pine deals, Lower Port birch, States walnut, &c., and from the outset a very numerous company was present.
The Pictou, N.S., birch timber ex Ashantee was afterwards exposed at Queen's Dock; also a parcel of prime States black walnut mark, recently landed. The divergence, however, between the ideas of buyers and sellers as to

values was a hindrance to business being done, and these goods were withdrawn.
For the Lower Port birch timber, which has been scarce here, offers were from 1s. 7d. to 1s. 10d. per cubic foot for pages of 15¼ in. to 16 in. average respectively, but the brokers' limits were higher.
The sale began at Yorkhill with the deals, but the company showed little disposition to buy, and the going over of the catalogue failed to elicit satisfactory competition except for a few lots.

GREENOCK.
Only one timber cargo came to hand during the week, per Caledonian, from Quebec, with the usual varied assortment, consigned to Cousland, & Co.
The James Watt Dock presents a very busy appearance with the discharge of this and the numerous arrivals reported in our last issue, as well as the general shipping business carried on there.
A moderate amount of business is being done, and prices remain practically steady, but we do not think, however, this is all that should be desired. In face of the large and steady advances in the values of coal, iron, &c., timber should not remain stationary; and it would not do so if a more discerning and judicious policy were pursued in the adjustment of supplies to demands.
We understand that Messrs. Caird & Co., shipbuilders, Greenock, have secured an order for two steamers, of 360 ft. each, for an Amsterdam firm.
Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co. will hold a sale here on the 21st inst.

LEITH.
The arrivals of wood goods this week are unimportant, comprising merely a sailer of battens from Hernosand, a cargo of firewood from Nederkalix, and some steamer parcels of deals and battens from Cronstadt, in addition to the usual oddments of staves, hoops, &c.
With the fine, open, dry weather building operations are not being interfered with, and a fair trade is doing from the docks and yards for the time of year. With the nearly completed, and the large outlet for wood required for the Edinburgh Exhibition of 1890 in prospect, there is better feeling among importers here, which will tend to greater firmness in prices owing to the Martinmas term falling this week there has been no public sale, but sales are already announced for the two succeeding weeks.

SERIOUS FIRE AT FAIRFIELD SHIPBUILDING YARD.—A serious fire occurred at Fairfield Shipbuilding Yard, Govan, on Tuesday the 12th inst. The outbreak took place in the oakum store, a shed 78 ft. long by 24 ft. wide, which was completely destroyed, along with a portion of the plumbers' shop, in which a large quantity of goods and woodwork was seriously damaged before the Govan fire brigade succeeded in arresting the flames. The damage is estimated at fully £3,000.
