Debts £751 8s. 1d., of which £500 is secured, and assets estimated at £96 2s. Mr. Aldridge appeared for the Official Receiver and examined the bankrupt, who said that he had been in business for six years on his own account. He was formerly associated with his father and took over some leasehold houses from him by assignment. He took the houses in order to relieve his father of his burden under the covenants. He took over the property conjointly with three brothers-in-law, and about September, 1888, he took over their shares with a view to selling the houses. He put them up for sale, but did not get a bid; they were mortgaged to the Sun Building Society. The examination was concluded.\nBRAZIER, J. H., builder and estate agent, 64, Grove Road, Bethnal Green, E.—The debtor has filed his petition, and a receiving order was made last week by Mr. Registrar Linklater. He stated that his furniture, which he valued at about £35, was covered by bill of sale. There was a small quantity of plant, &c., of the value of about £5. There were houses which were mortgaged, and the mortgagee had sold. The amount of the liabilities did not transpire.\nCLIMPSON, REUBEN, builder, Eastbourne.—This case came before Judge Martineau at the Lewes County Court, on Tuesday. Mr. Pope, solicitor, of Brighton, made an application to his Honour on behalf of Mr. Clark, accountant, for directions as to the conduct of the estate. His Honour directed that Mr. Clark, who was desirous of resigning the trusteeship, should call a meeting of creditors to consider his resignation and \"remove\" him from his office. The Judge's decision on the trustee's request to disclaim mortgaged property was adjourned until Friday next.\nFORD & KIRRAGE, builders, Ashbrook Road, Upper Holloway. — These bankrupts attended last week for their public examination before Mr. Registrar Haslitt. The unsecured debts were £601 12s., and debts fully secured £1,593, the assets showing a surplus, subject to the realisation of the mortgaged property. Ford was first examined,",
