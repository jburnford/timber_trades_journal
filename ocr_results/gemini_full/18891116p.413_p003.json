Debts £751 8s. 1d., of which £500 is secured, and assets estimated at £96 2s. Mr. Aldridge appeared for the Official Receiver and examined the bankrupt, who said that he had been in business for six years on his own account. He was formerly associated with his father and took over some leasehold houses from him by assignment. He took the houses in order to relieve his father of his burden under the covenants. He took over the property conjointly with three brothers-in-law, and about September, 1888, he took over their shares with a view to selling the houses. He put them up for sale, but did not get a bid; they were mortgaged to the Sun Building Society. The examination was concluded.\nBRAZIER, J. H., builder and estate agent, 64, Grove Road, Bethnal Green, E.—The debtor has filed his petition, and a receiving order was made last week by Mr. Registrar Linklater. He stated that his furniture, which he valued at about £95, was covered by bill of sale. There was a small quantity of plant, &c., of the value of about £5. There were houses which were mortgaged, and the mortgagee had sold. The amount of the liabilities did not transpire.\nCLIMPSON, REUBEN, builder, Eastbourne.—This case came before Judge Marineau at the Lewes County Court, on Tuesday. Mr. Pope, solicitor, of Brighton, made an application to his Honour on behalf of Mr. Clark, accountant, for directions as to the conduct of the estate. His Honour directed that Mr. Clark, who was desirous of resigning the trusteeship, should call a meeting of creditors to consider his resignation and \"remove\" him from his office. The Judge's decision on the trustee's request to disclaim mortgaged property was adjourned until Friday next.\nFORD & KIRRAGE, builders, Ashbrook Road, Upper Holloway.—These bankrupts attended last week for their public examination before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The unsecured debts were £601 12s., and debts fully secured £1,593, the assets showing a surplus, subject to the realisation of the mortgaged property. Ford was first examined,\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nand stated, in reply to the Official Solicitor, that they began to trade together in January 1889. He had a capital of £300, and Kirrage had £55. They tried about twelve months ago to sell some of the houses, but could not get a fair price for them. If the various properties could be sold at their proper value there would be quite enough to satisfy all the debts. He admitted that they had not kept a cash-book, nor accounts showing the transactions with the mortgagees and their own personal drawings. Mr. Kirrage concurred in his partner's answers, and explained that neither of them knew very much about bookkeeping. The trustee (Mr. Wild) informed the Court that the bankrupts had given him all the assistance in their power, and that he was satisfied. The examination was accordingly concluded.\nGARRETT, EDMUND, builder, West Hampstead and Eastbourne.—The receiving order in this case was made on May 31st last, and the bankrupt applied on Thursday to Mr. Registrar Hazlitt for his order of discharge. The unsecured liabilities were £1,859 0s. 5d., and debts fully secured £5,100, the assets consisting of surplus from securities, being estimated at £2,704, but they are stated to have realised £20. The bankrupt began business as a builder in December, 1883, with £50 of his own and £50 borrowed money, and built a number of houses at West Hampstead, all the wages for which and some of the material were advanced by the freeholder. He further stated that since December, 1887, he has discontinued building, and has been employed as a builder's foreman. Having regard to the small amount of capital possessed by the bankrupt when he commenced as a builder, and the fact that the houses as they were built were charged to the freeholder, the Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had brought on his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation. It was also alleged that the bankrupt had put one of his creditors to unnecessary expense by a frivolous and vexatious defence to an action. Mr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver and Mr. Ringwood on behalf of the bankrupt. Mr. Registrar Hazlitt said that the bankrupt (a working bricklayer, having £50 of his own and £50 borrowed money) entered into building speculations, getting the money from the freeholder, who knew very well that the houses would sooner or later fall into his hands. Goods were obtained from all quarters for the benefit of the freeholder, not of the creditors, and that was a sort of thing which the Court could not encourage. With reference to the defence to the action it appeared that the bankrupt had acted under the advice of his solicitor, and the charge against him of having set up a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action in question was not established; but upon the ground that he had brought on his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculations his discharge would be suspended for two years from the 8th of August, the date when he passed his public examination.\nGARRUD, JOHN, builder and contractor, Islington.—The debtor filed his petition on the 12th ult., and the first meeting of creditors was held on Friday, before Mr. Pope, acting for the Official Receiver. The accounts showed gross liabilities £6,685 5s. 5d., of which £3,795 was fully secured, and £2,808 5s. 5d. expected to rank, the assets being estimated at £22 16s. after providing for preferential payments. The following were scheduled as creditors:—\nUNSECURED.\n£ s. d.\nAllan James, sen., & Co., Upper Thames Street ... ... ... ... ... ... 122 0 0\nBracknell Brick and Tile Company ... ... 51 16 3\nBurt, Boulton, & Follett, Millbank, S.W. ... 41 15 0\nCullum & Haughton, Cannon Street ... ... 66 2 4\nCarter, Paterson & Co., Leicester ... ... ... 87 15 6\nDale, J., & Son, 34, Old Broad Street ... ... 205 0 7\nGasson, R.

In 1879 he presented a petition for liquidation (liabilities £8,256, and estimated assets £3,103), under which proceedings a composition of 7s. 6d. in the pound was accepted by the creditors. He obtained his discharge the following year, and continued building. He attributes his present failure and deficiency to his inability to sell or let or to obtain further advances on houses built and in course of building by him in Barrow Road, Streatham; to losses by bad debts, including a loss of £1,500 under a building agreement; to his expenses having been in excess of his profits, and to depreciation in the value of his houses as now estimated for realisation. Mr. Rawlings attended on behalf of the debtor, and said that he was unable to make any proposal. No resolution was passed, and the Official Receiver will, therefore, continue to act as trustee under the bankruptcy.\nGIBBS, W. H., builder, West Kensington Terrace, W.—Under a receiving order made in this case on the 19th July last, a statement of affairs has now been filed, showing gross liabilities £608,409, of which, however, not more than £13,941 are unsecured, and assets of the estimated value of £17,264. The securities consist chiefly of mortgages on property at Kensington and Fulham, which is said to have depreciated during the last few years to the extent of £150,000.\nGLOVER BROS., builders, Northam and Abbotsham.—The following are creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nDaintree & Smith, London ... ... ... 10 7 6\nFox Alfred & Co., London ... ... ... 18 13 4\nFox, Elliott, & Co., Plymouth ... ... ... 125 1 0\nJewell W.

Wilkins, Blyth, & Co., a receiving order was made last week by Mr. Registrar Linklater. The assets are of very considerable value, comprising stock, plant, and machinery, book debts, cash, and furniture. The liabilities were estimated at about £14,000. The wages were stated to amount to £250 a week. The Official Receiver subsequently appointed Mr. E. H. Collins, accountant, Coleman Street, to the office of special manager under the proceedings, with a view mainly to the supervision and completion of pending contracts.\nHARVEY, SAMUEL T., surveyor and builder, 46, Queen Victoria Street, London.—The following are creditors in this recent failure:—\n£ s. d.\nAspland & Co., London ... ... ... 89 19 6\nBritish Iron Co., London ... ... ... 36 16 10\nColes Bros., London ... ... ... ... 12 15 10\nCox & Hunt, London ... ... ... ... 16 18 2\nCramer & Co., London ... ... ... ... 10 2 0\nCull R. & Co., London ... ... ... ... 31 12 6\nCurzon J.

The unsecured debts were £735 1s. 11d., and the assets are reported to have realised £20. Mr. F. C. Willis appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Registrar Brougham suspended the discharge of the bankrupt. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had made himself liable on accommodation bills, and thereby incurred debts without having any reasonable expectation of being able to pay the same; also that his books of account were insufficient. Mr. Registrar Brougham suspended the discharge of the bankrupt for nine months from the date of passing his examination.\nSIMPSON, WILLIAM, timber merchant, St. Peter's Wharf, Amberley Road, W.—The bankrupt filed his petition in April, 1888, and should be taken.",
