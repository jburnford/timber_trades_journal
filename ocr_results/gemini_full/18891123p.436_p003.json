Ward, Perks, & M'Kay, a receiving order was made last week by Mr. Registrar Linklater. The debtor stated that in High Road, Leyton, they have a freehold timber yard, which is mortgaged. They estimate their stock of timber and building materials there at about £250. At the Great Eastern Depot there was stock of the value of about £80. There were also 18 horses and 14 carts. The book debts (good) amounted to £400 or £500; bad debts £150. The liabilities were estimated at from £4,200 to £5,000. The Sheriff of Essex was in possession.\nGIBBS, W. H., builder, West Kensington Terrace, W.—An abstract of the accounts filed under this heavy failure was given in our last issue, and according to the Official Receiver's observations (which have since been issued), in the bankrupt states that in 1876 he commenced business as a builder at the Cedars Estate, at West Kensington, and at Fulham, in partnership with J. P. Flew, as \"Gibbs & Flew,\" which was carried on successfully until 1882, when the partnership expired (the capital of the firm then amounting, it is stated, to about £100,000, consisting of plant, stock, house properties, and building estates), and the business was converted into a limited company, \"Gibbs & Flew, Limited,\" (the name being subsequently changed to the \"West Kensington Estates Company, Limited\") in consideration of the sale whereto of the business and a large portion of the properties, he and his partner each received fully paid up shares for £30,000, and were appointed managing directors of the company. The company, however, went into liquidation in 1885, after which, he states, he and his late partner were engaged jointly until June, 1887, in realising their remaining properties and completing houses for the company and mortgagees, and that for about the last two years he has carried on business principally of a professional character, as a surveyor and engineer, his building transactions having consisted mostly of finishing and repairing properties for mortgagees. Creditors appearing as \"fully secured\" are stated to be principally mortgagees (in possession) of leasehold and freehold house properties and building estates, the values whereof have been estimated by the bankrupt on the footing of forced realisations, and which he considers will yield a surplus more than sufficient to satisfy his unsecured liabilities. Of the creditors \"partly secured,\" £3,265 7s. 5d. is described as being in respect of liabilities arising out of joint transactions of himself and late partner (Flew), subsequent to the failure of the limited company in 1885, chiefly in connection with the completion of properties for the company and mortgagees, and in defending law suits arising out of such failure: the remaining £5,545 10s. being in respect of personal indebtedness, including his liability on the shares of the land corporation before referred to. The securities held are stated to consist of a charge on fees due to the bankrupt from a Belgian Brick Works Company (of which he\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. [NOVEMBER 23, 1889.\nwas directing engineer); debentures in a steam joinery works; the leases of his premises, 5, West Kensington Terrace, and two other houses, and charges on a portion of an estate, and certain agreements. His late partner, J. P. Flew, was adjudged bankrupt in August, 1888, and has obtained his discharge. An item, \"other property,\" in the assets consists of the aforesaid fully paid up shares in \"Gibbs & Flew, Limited,\" which are considered to be valueless. The bankrupt attributes his failure to losses and liabilities arising out of the failure of the companies, as above stated, and particularly to liabilities under his personal covenants in mortgages; also to his inability to realise his properties in time to satisfy mortgagees and others who were pressing.\nJAMES, THOMAS, builder and contractor, Stoke Newington, and Amhurst Park, Stamford Hill. — The meeting for public examination in this case was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The accounts showed unsecured debts £3,230 3s. 2d., and debts fully secured £85,349 12s. 9d., against assets £985 5s. 2d. Mr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver, Mr. S. Woolf for the debtor, and Mr. F. C. Willis on behalf of creditors. Upon examination by Mr. Howell, the debtor said that he had been in business seven years, and had, during the latter part of the time, traded as a speculative builder. For the last two years he had taken contracts for building upon the Tyssen-Amhurst Estate, Stamford Hill. He commenced with a capital of £2,000, and during part of the time had a partner in the business, but the partnership terminated in 1886, and he afterwards traded alone. A few months after the dissolution a Chancery action was commenced by the late partner, under which a compromise was come to, with the result that a claim was recently made against his estate, and the petition had to be filed. He sustained a loss of £2,000 by taking over an agreement to complete twenty houses upon the Darley and Anwick Roads. Two years ago he entered into an agreement to build twenty-five houses, but after raising thirteen carcases he found they were not wanted, and decided not to proceed further, as he wished to build some shops at Stamford Hill. In September last he sold the houses at Stamford Hill to Mrs. Jewell. That lady was his sister, and she paid him £3,000 for the equities. In reply to Mr. Willis, the debtor said that no advances were made by Mrs. Jewell upon the houses before the equities were purchased. The sale was made in consequence of his requiring money to pay to creditors. He had a surplus of £1,000 in September, 1888, but it was locked up in the buildings. His present unsecured debts had been contracted since the beginning of the year. By Mr. Woolf: The capital of £2,000 with which he commenced had, by 1879, been increased to £3,000. It was in consequence of an action brought by his late partner for the settlement of the partnership accounts that he was prevented from dealing with the property, and possession was taken by the freeholder, by causing his failure. His Honour allowed the debtor to pass his examination.\nMAYNARD, EDWARD, Brockley, builder. — The public examination of this debtor came on for hearing last week at the Greenwich Court. Mr. Deputy-Registrar Bristow presided, and Mr. Cecil Mercer, Official Receiver, was present. The gross liabilities amount to £2,265 2s. 6d., assets £679 11s. 9d., and the deficiency £346 10s. The debtor commenced business in 1884 as a master mason, with a capital of £95, and only commenced business as a builder this year. The freeholders have taken possession of such part of the property as has not been sold. The examination was adjourned for a fortnight.\nSMITH, W., builder, Beauchamp Road, E.—The first meeting of creditors in this case was held last week before Mr. Chapman, Assistant Receiver. The accounts showed total liabilities £10,988 3s. 3d., of which £8,118 11s. 6d. are unsecured, and no available assets.

The winter season being upon us the amount of wood going into consumption is considerably less than it would be were the full days at disposal for general work, but, notwithstanding this unfavourable time, orders are sufficiently plentiful to keep saw-mills brisk; the deliveries are unusually heavy for the month of November, and there is no lessening of the prospects for some time to come. The position of prices is unaltered, for, although the trade doing is satisfactory, there is a lack of competition to secure them, and some firms holding, perhaps, an unusually heavy stock, in their anxiety to secure business unduly prevent any opportunity beginning to consider the propriety of advancing rates to such a state as would leave, at last, some margin over the bare cost of this year's imports.\nThis week has again been marked by a light import list. This fact has further strengthened the cheerful feeling that has prevailed, and holders are now speculating as to when a stiffening of retail prices may take place. There is no doubt that the present scale is quite incommensurate with the high c.i.f. prices that have been paid for imports, and this scale has remained stationary, not for the reason of bad trade or want of consumption, but exclusively owing to the heavy imports of some of the ports. Now that the deliveries are now almost entirely taking place from the piles, the question of raising prices comes into serious consideration, and the matter lies altogether in the holders' hands, as timber is being consumed at a very",
