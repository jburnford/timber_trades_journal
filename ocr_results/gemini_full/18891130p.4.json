It was a most stirring scene, and is not confined to Baltimore, but extends to Castletownbere, Valencia, Glandore Harbour, and other places round that coast, and might, I am convinced, be extended to many parts of the Irish coast, bringing wealth into the country, and giving such profitable employment. It was a source of great gratification to me to find a large fishing fleet at present engaged in mackerel fishing consisted chiefly of Irish vessels. Thousands and thousands of barrels are at present used for this trade of mackerel; but it is with regret and shame I have to confess that there are all imported from Scotland or England, instead of being manufactured at home.\nThis mackerel fishing, both in autumn and spring, has been developing in a formidable manner. The autumn fish are all cured in barrels and exported to America. The spring fish are sent fresh, in boxes, iced, to the English markets; and while thousands and thousands of boxes are used for this purpose in spring, hardly any of them are manufactured in Ireland.\nThe trustees of the Baltimore Fishing School want the means, as pointed out in Father Davis's late letter, to import timber for boats and staves hoops for barrels, from which they might make large profits, which would be available for teaching the boys other industries while instructing them in two arts so closely connected with fishing, viz., carpentering and coopering; and from the former boatbuilding would be sure to follow. Once commenced, these industries would, I am convinced, extend to other places. It cannot, however, be done, as Father Davis explained, without sufficient money to import cargoes of timber, staves, and hoops direct. I cannot help feeling that if many who desire to see Ireland's fishing industry fully developed, only knew the great difficulty in establishing these trades they would cheerfully contribute funds for the purpose; and it is in the hope that this may meet the eyes of some of those benevolent people, I ask you to kindly give space for this letter to your Journal.\nI am, dear sir, yours truly,\nTHOMAS F. BRADY.\n11, Percy Place, Dublin,\n10th October, 1889.\n\nTHE IRISH FISHING INDUSTRY.\nWE have received the following correspondence.\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE LIMERICK CHRONICLE.\nDEAR SIR,—It is so cheering to be able to speak of any accomplished fact connected with the development of any industry in Ireland, that I cannot refrain from communicating the pleasing intelligence that on my last visit to Baltimore, co. Cork, from which I have just returned, I found fishing in full swing; and that place (Baltimore), which was a few years ago but a poor village, now a hive of industry and enterprise—English, Scotch, and Americans purchasing and curing mackerel extensively for the American markets.
