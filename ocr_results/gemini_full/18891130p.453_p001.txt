LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
A TIMBER DEALING TRANSACTION.
WILSON & CO. v. GEORGE HORSLEY & CO.
This case came on for hearing in the Gloucester County Court on the 13th inst. Mr. Tanfield was for plaintiffs, and Mr. Taynton for defendants. It was an action to recover £6 6s., £4 13s. 2d. of the amount having been paid for a quantity of birch wood and carriage of same, which plaintiffs alleged was affected with the dry rot and only fit for firewood. The balance was claimed for profit that would have been made had the wood been of good quality. His Honour gave judgment for the plaintiffs for £2, with costs.

WOOD ALLEGED TO BE INFERIOR.
LEWIS GASSON v. THOMAS COOK.
Mr. Lewis Gasson, timber merchant, of Forest Hill, brought an action in the Greenwich County Court against Thomas Cook, of Montague Place, Brockley Road, Forest Hill, to recover £34 14s. 6d. for timber supplied to defendant upon two bills of exchange. There was a counter-claim by defendant for loss of time, labour, and expenditure in making up five screens and loss of profit thereon, said to be due to the inferior nature of the wood supplied by Gasson, this amount being set down at £38 1s. 4d. The wood was got to make screens, but was so bad that 30 out of 100 of these articles had been returned. A builder said that dry pine in the trade was seasoned pine. He saw the wood which Cook had obtained for the screens, and it was not dry wood; 1st quality pine could not be bought for 7d., it cost from 9½d. to 10d. The plaintiff said the defendant never complained about the wood until the bills became due. He (plaintiff) did not sell the wood for seasoned pine. He took Cook's order for wood in January. Cook's man selected the wood and went away with it. A verdict was returned for Mr. Gasson on his own claim and on the counter-claim.

A SAWYER'S INJURIES.—ACTION FOR DAMAGES.
CHAPLIN v. THE WIRE-WOVE ROOFING COMPANY.
In the City of London Court, on Monday, the case of Chaplin v. the Patent Wire-wove Waterproof Roofing Company, Limited, was heard before Mr. Commissioner Kerr and a jury. The plaintiff, John Chaplin, sawyer, of 4, Berwick Road, South Norwood, sought to recover compensation laid at £100 for personal injuries he had sustained in consequence, as he alleged, of the negligence of the servants of the defendant company, of 108, Queen Victoria Street, E.C.
It appeared that on the 24th of April last the plaintiff was engaged as a sawyer by the defendant company, and his employment consisted of working at their steam saw-mills where timber was being cut all day by means of a circular saw. The bench, or table, at which the saw was working, was improperly fixed, a large nail being driven into the side of the table with the object of keeping it in its place. The nail was left projecting. The plaintiff was engaged in feeding the saw with timber, his fellow-workman, Dixon, receiving it at the other end. The plaintiff, on the day in question, was in the act of taking a piece of timber from the machine, when one of his feet caught in the projecting nail. The plaintiff then fell forward, his hand going on to the circular saw, which was revolving at great speed. The sinews of his wrist were cut right through, and the result of the calamity was that the plaintiff was deprived of any feeling in two of his fingers. He was removed to Guy's Hospital, where his injuries were attended to, and he remained an in-patient for some weeks, afterwards attending as an out-patient. So far as his trade as a sawyer went he was a perfect wreck, as he had lost the use of his right hand to all intents and purposes. He had succeeded in getting work as a painter's labourer, as he could do the labour with his left hand.
The jury found for the plaintiff, and awarded him £35.
Judgment was entered accordingly, and costs allowed.

BENNETT & Co. v. BASTOW & SON.
The plaintiffs in this case, which was reported last week, have withdrawn their claim, and each side will pay its own costs.

CORRESPONDENCE.
QUESTIONING AT PUBLIC SALES.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—I trust I shall have the support of the timber trade if I raise a protest against your comment as contained in the last paragraph of the middle column page 425 of your issue 23rd inst.
Apart from the particular incident that occurred at Messrs. Simson & Mason's auction on the 20th inst., it seems to me a monstrous presumption that you should even suggest the suppression of open public inquiry at time of sale respecting any goods offered at public auction. It speaks well, perhaps, for the timber trade that there should hitherto have been so little and infrequent cause to call forth any remarks, but when any such cause exists, or even appears to exist, surely the time and place for such inquiry are in the room before all present, for the benefit of all or whom it may concern. Go to other auctions, of land, of wool, &c., and what do we find? Why, that inquiry is courted, not burked; and so it must be in our trade, if the circumstances demand it.
Now let us look at the particular question raised on this occasion, that has called forth such unseemly remarks in your Journal. Note the circumstances, and reconsider whether it was not only justifiable but actually demanded. Certain Torefors (Haparanda) goods were offered, marked TMT, TTT, TFT, T*D. According to former shipments, and also according to the book of marks, issued by your publishers (1887 edition), these marks have always represented the four qualities classed respectively as 1sts and 2nds, or mixed, 3rds, and 5ths, but in the catalogue in question they were described as 1sts, 2nds, 3rds, and thus raising the description by one quality. Now this catalogue description happens to be the French classification (see aforesaid book of marks). What, then, more reasonable than that a buyer should inquire whether the goods, so classified, were out to the French measurements, more particularly as such French-cut goods have frequently appeared in our public sale catalogues? and yet, forsooth, this inquiry is suggested as prejudicial to the sale of the goods!
No, the trade must not allow itself to be put down in this way, but whenever occasion calls a voice should be heard in the saleroom in reasonable questioning, and I hope that when a buyer thinks there is need for it he will not hesitate to question, whoever the auctioneer may be, and further that he may secure from the room some expression of its approval if his remarks commend themselves.—Yours faithfully,
JOS. WILKINSON.
London, November 27th, 1889.

A CORRECTION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—We hasten to correct a misstatement which has appeared in your issue of this week concerning ourselves.
We were not the buyers of the whole of Dickson's Sandarne stock of planed boards, but we have been incorrectly informed, but we did purchase the balance of Dickson's later shipment of Sandarne deals, part of which is now discharging ex Montrose, 13 to 15, Acorn Yard. Doubtless this will account for the mistake that you have fallen into.
Kindly give this correction a place in your next week's paper, and oblige, yours truly,
FARQUHARSON BROS. & Co.
82, Bishopsgate Street Within,
London, 25th November, 1889.
