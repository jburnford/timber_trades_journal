FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that creditors whose names are published are not necessarily creditors for the full amount.]
ANGOLD, WM., builder, 23, Regent Street, Regent's Park, N.W.-The Official Receiver's observations are that the debtor, who describes himself as a timber merchant, states that he commenced business in 1886, with £1,400 capital, which he expended in purchasing the lease of and erecting business premises, Phoenix Wharf, Regent's Canal, and that in December last (the business having proved unprofitable) he disposed of the lease and the greater part of his stock for £1,000, out of which he paid the majority of his trade creditors. Further, that in 1887, in consideration of an advance of £500, he executed a bill of sale on his household furniture and trade effects, and possession was taken thereunder, and in February last the greater part of his remaining stock was sold by the Sheriff, realising a net sum of £130, which has been paid over to the Official Receiver.

BRANDON, GEORGE H., Ethel Road, Kingston, Portsmouth, timber merchant.-This debtor, who was represented by Mr. Feltham, appeared for his adjourned public examination. The Official Receiver stated that the matter was adjourned for a month to enable him to make independent inquiries into the debtor's affairs, and these having been completed, he did not now propose to ask debtor any more questions. Mr. J. F. Glanville, for a creditor, asked for an adjournment, and debtor was allowed to pass.
BUTCHER, CHARLES, 22, Barclay Road, and 12, Barclay Avenue, Fulham, S.W.-The bankrupt applied last week, to Mr. Registrar Brougham, for his order of discharge. The liabilities were returned at £355 11s. 4d., and the assets £104 10s., but nothing has been realised therefrom. It appeared that the bankrupt...
