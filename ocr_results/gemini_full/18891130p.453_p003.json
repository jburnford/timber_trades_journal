Feltham, appeared for his adjourned public examination.\nThe Official Receiver said that the matter was adjourned for the purpose of making independent inquiries of certain kinds, and these having been completed he did not propose to ask debtor any more questions.\nMr. J. F. Glanville, for a creditor, did not oppose, and debtor was allowed to pass.\nBUTCHER, CHARLES, builder, Lodge Avenue, Fulham, S.W.—The bankrupt applied, last week, to Mr. Registrar Giffard for his order of discharge.\nThe liabilities were returned at £255 11s. 4d., and the assets at £104 10s., but nothing has been realised therefrom.\nIt appeared that the bankrupt had got into difficulties about a party wall, in connection with which an action had been brought and judgment recovered against him for £55.\nJudgment had also been entered against him for £100 in an action for trespass.\nMr. Aldridge appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Linnett for the petitioning creditor.\nHis Honour, upon the ground of the insufficiency of the bankrupt's books, suspended his discharge for three months.\nFOAD, CEPHAS, builder, of West Cliff, Whitstable.—This debtor has attended for public examination at the Canterbury Court.\nIn reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor said he commenced business about twenty-five years ago without capital.\nA few years ago he lost £250 in building Nackington Vicarage.\nThe clergyman was not prepared to pay when the building was covered.\nThis crippled him, as it deprived him of his capital.\nHe was severely examined as to some property and furniture at Whitstable, which he said belonged to his wife, and which was purchased by money left her father.\nThe debtor was ordered to file particulars of the money received by his wife, and how disbursed.\nThe examination was adjourned for three weeks.\nGARRARD, JOHN, builder and contractor, John Street, Hackney, and Southgate Road, Islington, N.—The meeting for the bankrupt's public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt.\nLiabilities £6,685 5s. 5d., of which £3,795 are fully secured, and £2,808 5s. 5d. expected to rank; assets estimated at £2,216 after providing for preferential payments.\nMr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver, and examined the bankrupt, who said that he had traded as a builder since 1864.\nIn 1879 he presented a petition and paid a composition of 7s. in the pound.\nHe continued his business and had contracts on hand which the trustee helped him to carry on.\nIn December last he began building at his own risk, and his failure was caused by his inability to sell the houses.\nHis liabilities were for materials for the houses, and the freeholder went into possession in September, 1889.\nHe filed his petition because creditors were pressing him; Messrs. King & Scarborough pressed him for a debt of £200 for timber.\nHe lost £1,500 on a contract commenced in 1884.\nHe went through his affairs about once a year in order to ascertain how he stood, but had never made out a proper balance sheet.\nReplying to Mr. Rawlings (his solicitor), the bankrupt said that after payment of the composition under his former failure he had property of the value of about £600.\nThe bankrupt passed his examination.\nGARRETT, EDMUND, builder, West Hampstead and Eastbourne.—This case (recently reported) came before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt last week, upon a re-hearing of the bankrupt's application for an order of discharge.\nThe Registrar had suspended the discharge for two years, upon the ground that the bankrupt was brought on his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation; but Mr. S. Woolf now submitted that the judgment of the Court was based upon an entire misapprehension of the facts.\nHe examined the bankrupt, who stated that he had had £3,000 capital of his own, and his wife also had separate property.\nIn two years he turned over £20,000.\nAt the beginning of 1888 he was attacked by rheumatic fever, which laid him up for seven or eight months, and prevented him from attending to any business whatever.\nWhile he was ill the mortgagees served him with a writ, and they afterwards recovered judgment and levied a distress on some furniture.\nHe brought an action against them for illegal distress, and the proceedings were still pending.\nHe did not know of any one but the petitioning creditor as opposing him in his bankruptcy.\nHe\n\nGIBBS, W. H., builder, West Kensington and Fulham.—Particulars of this case appeared in our last issue, and the bankrupt's public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt.\nThe gross liabilities amounted to £608,403 11s., but of these £377,843 10s. are not expected to rank, being fully secured, the amount against which there are assets (consisting chiefly of surplus from security) of the estimated value of £312,756 7s., or a surplus over liabilities, subject to realisation, of £3,161 15s. 2d.\nMr. H. C. Barker, who appeared for the trustee, said that he was perfectly satisfied, and had no questions to ask.\nMr. Howell, on behalf of the Official Receiver, examined the bankrupt as to his various transactions, the details of which have already (in substance) been given in the Timber Trades Journal, and in the result his examination to be concluded.\nGREENWOOD, CRAPPER, cabinet-maker, Bacup Road, Rawtenstall.—This debtor's statement of affairs shows liabilities amounting to £1,069 5s. 6d., and assets estimated at £184 18s. 10d., which therefore shows a deficiency of £884 6s. 8d.\nAt the first meeting of creditors, held last week at the Official Receiver's offices, Bridge Street, Manchester, it was resolved to accept, subject to the sanction of the Court, the debtor's offer of a composition of 3s. in the pound.\nFrom the observations on the case it appears that the debtor filed his petition on the 25th October.\nHe first commenced business on his own account on November 1st, 1888, as a cabinet-maker, at Rawtenstall.\nHe had no money of his own with which to commence business, but his father lent him £400, on which he had paid interest at the rate of 5 per cent.\nThe debtor had for some time past been suffering from rheumatism, which had prevented him from properly attending to his business.\nHe attributed his insolvency to bad trade, sickness, and want of capital, and stated that he knew he was insolvent about three months since, but it was evident from his deficiency account that he must have been insolvent for two or three years.\nIt appeared on the facts that he had been carrying on business at a loss for some time.\nGREENWOOD, E. G., builder, at the Street, Walworth, S.E.—The debtor has filed his petition, and a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Giffard.\nThe assets are stated to consist of a small quantity of building plant, and the furniture belonging to the debtor's wife.\nAn adjudication of bankruptcy was also made.\nHACKETT, EDWIN, joiner and builder, 3, Osborne Road, Moston, Lancs.—The following are the principal creditors in this recent failure :—\nBuck & Wright, Manchester ... ... 13 19 3\nBarlow Aaron, Nailsworth ... ... 15 3 4\nBurke Thomas, Manchester ... ... 23 7 6\nBaxendale & Co., Manchester ... ... 17 15 6\nEvans George & Sons, Manchester ... 38 0 11\nHackett Ann, Moston ... ... ... 25 0 0\nHargreaves James, Manchester ... 19 0 4\nPayne Geo., Manchester ... ... 15 15 0\nSouthern & Wheeldon, Manchester ... 45 8 3\nHENSON, EMANUEL, cabinet-maker, 49, Maundin Street, Kingsdown.—At the Bristol Bankruptcy Court on Friday week, before Mr. Registrar Wright, this debtor came up for public examination.\nMr. E.
