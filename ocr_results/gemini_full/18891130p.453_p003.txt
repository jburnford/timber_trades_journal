FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
(It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.)
ANGOLD, WM., builder, 74, Osnaburgh Street, Regent's Park, N.W.—According to the Official Receiver's observations the debtor, who describes himself as a timber merchant, states that he commenced business in 1883 with £1,400 capital, which he expended in the purchasing the lease of and stocking his late premises, Phoenix Wharf, Redhill Street, and that in December last (the business having proved unprofitable) he disposed of the lease and the greater part of his stock for about £600, out of which he paid the majority of his then trade creditors.
Further, that in April, 1889, in consideration of an advance of £100, he executed a bill of sale on his household furniture and trade effects, and possession has been taken thereunder, and in September the greater part of his remaining stock was sold by the Sheriff, realising a net sum of £29 11s., which has been paid over to the Official Receiver.
The debtor attributes his insolvency generally to losses by the forced sales above mentioned, to law costs and expenses, and to his expenses having been in excess of his net profits, which, he states, were small, owing to depression and excessive competition in trade.
The debtor has been adjudged bankrupt and the Court has made an order for summary administration.
BRANDON, GEORGE HENRY, builder, Ethel Road, Kingston, Portsmouth.—At the Portsmouth Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, this debtor, who was represented by Mr. G. Feltham, appeared for his adjourned public examination.
The Official Receiver said that the matter was adjourned for the purpose of making independent inquiries of certain kinds, and these having been completed he did not propose to ask debtor any more questions.
Mr. J. F. Glanville, for a creditor, did not oppose, and debtor was allowed to pass.
BUTCHER, CHARLES, builder, Lodge Avenue, Fulham, S.W.—The bankrupt applied, last week, to Mr. Registrar Giffard for his order of discharge.
The liabilities were returned at £255 11s. 4d., and the assets at £104 10s., but nothing has been realised therefrom.
It appeared that the bankrupt had got into difficulties about a party wall, in connection with which an action had been brought and judgment recovered against him for £55.
Judgment had also been entered against him for £100 in an action for trespass.
Mr. Aldridge appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Linnett for the petitioning creditor.
His Honour, upon the ground of the insufficiency of the bankrupt's books, suspended his discharge for three months.
FOAD, CEPHAS, builder, of West Cliff, Whitstable.—This debtor has attended for public examination at the Canterbury Court.
In reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor said he commenced business about twenty-five years ago without capital.
A few years ago he lost £250 in building Nackington Vicarage.
The clergyman was not prepared to pay when the building was covered.
This crippled him, as it deprived him of his capital.
He was severely examined as to some property and furniture at Whitstable, which he said belonged to his wife, and which was purchased by money left her father.
The debtor was ordered to file particulars of the money received by his wife, and how disbursed.
The examination was adjourned for three weeks.
GARRARD, JOHN, builder and contractor, John Street, Hackney, and Southgate Road, Islington, N.—The meeting for the bankrupt's public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt.
Liabilities £6,685 5s. 5d., of which £3,795 are fully secured, and £2,808 5s. 5d. expected to rank; assets estimated at £2,216 after providing for preferential payments.
Mr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver, and examined the bankrupt, who said that he had traded as a builder since 1864.
In 1879 he presented a petition and paid a composition of 7s. in the pound.
He continued his business and had contracts on hand which the trustee helped him to carry on.
In December last he began building at his own risk, and his failure was caused by his inability to sell the houses.
His liabilities were for materials for the houses, and the freeholder went into possession in September, 1889.
He filed his petition because creditors were pressing him; Messrs. King & Scarborough pressed him for a debt of £200 for timber.
He lost £1,500 on a contract commenced in 1884.
He went through his affairs about once a year in order to ascertain how he stood, but had never made out a proper balance sheet.
Replying to Mr. Rawlings (his solicitor), the bankrupt said that after payment of the composition under his former failure he had property of the value of about £600.
The bankrupt passed his examination.
GARRETT, EDMUND, builder, West Hampstead and Eastbourne.—This case (recently reported) came before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt last week, upon a re-hearing of the bankrupt's application for an order of discharge.
The Registrar had suspended the discharge for two years, upon the ground that the bankrupt was brought on his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation; but Mr. S. Woolf now submitted that the judgment of the Court was based upon an entire misapprehension of the facts.
He examined the bankrupt, who stated that he had had £3,000 capital of his own, and his wife also had separate property.
In two years he turned over £20,000.
At the beginning of 1888 he was attacked by rheumatic fever, which laid him up for seven or eight months, and prevented him from attending to any business whatever.
While he was ill the mortgagees served him with a writ, and they afterwards recovered judgment and levied a distress on some furniture.
He brought an action against them for illegal distress, and the proceedings were still pending.
He did not know of any one but the petitioning creditor as opposing him in his bankruptcy.
He

GIBBS, W. H., builder, West Kensington and Fulham.—Particulars of this case appeared in our last issue, and the bankrupt's public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt.
The gross liabilities amounted to £608,403 11s., but of these £377,843 10s. are not expected to rank, being fully secured, the amount against which there are assets (consisting chiefly of surplus from security) of the estimated value of £312,756 7s., or a surplus over liabilities, subject to realisation, of £3,161 15s. 2d.
Mr. H. C. Barker, who appeared for the trustee, said that he was perfectly satisfied, and had no questions to ask.
Mr. Howell, on behalf of the Official Receiver, examined the bankrupt as to his various transactions, the details of which have already (in substance) been given in the Timber Trades Journal, and in the result his examination to be concluded.
GREENWOOD, CRAPPER, cabinet-maker, Bacup Road, Rawtenstall.—This debtor's statement of affairs shows liabilities amounting to £1,069 5s. 6d., and assets estimated at £184 18s. 10d., which therefore shows a deficiency of £884 6s. 8d.
At the first meeting of creditors, held last week at the Official Receiver's offices, Bridge Street, Manchester, it was resolved to accept, subject to the sanction of the Court, the debtor's offer of a composition of 3s. in the pound.
From the observations on the case it appears that the debtor filed his petition on the 25th October.
He first commenced business on his own account on November 1st, 1888, as a cabinet-maker, at Rawtenstall.
He had no money of his own with which to commence business, but his father lent him £400, on which he had paid interest at the rate of 5 per cent.
The debtor had for some time past been suffering from rheumatism, which had prevented him from properly attending to his business.
He attributed his insolvency to bad trade, sickness, and want of capital, and stated that he knew he was insolvent about three months since, but it was evident from his deficiency account that he must have been insolvent for two or three years.
It appeared on the facts that he had been carrying on business at a loss for some time.
GREENWOOD, E. G., builder, at the Street, Walworth, S.E.—The debtor has filed his petition, and a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Giffard.
The assets are stated to consist of a small quantity of building plant, and the furniture belonging to the debtor's wife.
An adjudication of bankruptcy was also made.

Mr. E. G. Clarke) represented the Board of Trade.
Mr. King stated that debtor had paid away £175 to creditors under a former composition, and that lod to his present failure.
The examination was adjourned until November 22nd.
At the Bristol Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, this debtor came up for public examination before the Registrar (Mr. Wright).
Mr. King appeared for the debtor, and after some further questions put to the debtor, the examination was concluded.
HEMYING, PHILIP HENRY, of 69, Beulah Road, Thornton Heath, late builder and contractor.—Particulars in this matter are just to hand.
The gross liabilities are set down at £3,424 12s. 3d.; creditors fully secured, £2,900; creditors unsecured, £524 12s. 3d.; assets nil, and the deficiency £524 12s. 3d.
The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition.
The debtor states that when he commenced business in 1886, he entered into partnership with Mr. Aaron S. Dyke, late of Thornton Heath, as builders and contractors, in January last, and since this date he has carried on a small business at 69, Beulah Road, as house and insurance agent.
He attributes his position to losses arising from the aforesaid partnership.
