There is, in addition to the import list given on another page, the cargo per Wellams, from Miramichi, consisting of spruce deals chiefly, and consigned to Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co.\nGREENOCK.\nThree cargoes of timber arrived during the week, all from Quebec, of the usual assortment brought to Greenock. These are the Curlew, for Allison, Cousland, & Co. ; the Frida, for R. Sheriff; and the Gylfe, for Allison, Cousland, & Co. Very rough weather was experienced on the passage owing to which the Curlew's deckload was washed overboard; but this vessel had a quick passage of 23 days, notwithstanding.\nThe discharge of these cargoes is in progress, after which we may look forward to a period of comparative quietness, in so far as the reception of goods is concerned. We do not anticipate that the stocks of timber in hand by the end of the year will show any great excess, unless perhaps in one or two kinds, and with the present consumption and prospective requirements there need be no fear but that timber generally will at least maintain, if it does not increase, its present value.\nShipbuilding has been characterised by great activity during November. The amount of tonnage launched and in hand is considerable, and several good orders have\n\nD. W.

Park, Dobson, & Co. There are still a few sailers afloat, which should be dropping in between this and the close of the year, unless they meet with some accident.\nThe weather continues dry, and a fair business is still being done from the yards and docks for the season of the year. The deliveries of wood required for the Edinburgh Exhibition are going on steadily, both from Leith and Granton, and those will make an appreciable difference in stocks before the end of the month.\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nNov. 29 Farder (s)—Christiania—11,138 props—T.
