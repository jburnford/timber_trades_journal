Holders of stocks are in the meantime firm in their prices and not disposed to press the goods on the market, being confident that there is a good prospect for business from the healthy state of trade generally.
Shipbuilding in particular is in a flourishing condition, the work on hand having been very largely augmented by the new contracts secured during last month, the total of which is reported to amount to 80,000 tons.
The arrivals during the past week have been light. There is, in addition to the import list given on another page, the cargo per Wellams, from Miramichi, consisting of spruce deals chiefly, and consigned to Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co.
GREENOCK.
Three cargoes of timber arrived during the week, all from Quebec, of the usual assortment brought to Greenock. These are the Curlew, for Allison, Cousland, & Co. ; the Frida, for R. Sheriff; and the Gylfe, for Allison, Cousland, & Co. Very rough weather was experienced on the passage owing to which the Curlew's deckload was washed overboard; but this vessel had a quick passage of 23 days, notwithstanding.
The discharge of these cargoes is in progress, after which we may look forward to a period of comparative quietness, in so far as the reception of goods is concerned. We do not anticipate that the stocks of timber in hand by the end of the year will show any great excess, unless perhaps in one or two kinds, and with the present consumption and prospective requirements there need be no fear but that timber generally will at least maintain, if it does not increase, its present value.
Shipbuilding has been characterised by great activity during November. The amount of tonnage launched and in hand is considerable, and several good orders have

been lately booked, Caird & Co., Scott & Co., and Russell & Co., all securing large contracts. The last auction sale of 1889 will be held here on the 12th current by Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.
LEITH.
There have been a few more arrivals of wood goods during the past week, including the Ahti, from Helsingfors, and the Neptune, from Ornskjoldsvik, both with deals and battens for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. There are still a few sailers afloat, which should be dropping in between this and the close of the year, unless they meet with some accident.
The weather continues dry, and a fair business is still being done from the yards and docks for the season of the year. The deliveries of wood required for the Edinburgh Exhibition are going on steadily, both from Leith and Granton, and those will make an appreciable difference in stocks before the end of the month.
