THE IMPROVED NAVIGATION OF THE SEVERN. —The Severn Commission met at Worcester on Friday week to consider the Severn navigation improvement scheme. It was stated that Cardiff merchants had guaranteed £6,000, Lord Bute £3,000, and Worcester and Cardiff Corporations £10,000 towards the £25,000 required for the works, and that further assistance would be obtained from Newport and Birmingham. It was agreed by a majority of four votes to proceed with the Bill in the next Session of Parliament authorising the improvement.

THE KAURI TIMBER COMPANY, LIMITED.
The first annual report and balance-sheet of this company for the year ending August 31st, 1889 have just reached us. The latter shows gross profits to the amount of £164,688 12s. 1d., and the net profits are £63,297 6s. 3d., which are appropriated as follows :—Preliminary expenses account, £10,000 ; reserve fund, £10,000 ; dividend for the year at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, £45,000 ; leaving a balance of £4,286 5s. 8d. The next year's account, result must be considered very satisfactory, taking into consideration the great labour and expense of organising so large a business, and the severe depression which has existed in the local markets in New Zealand. During the year consignments of timber have been made to London, Glasgow, and foreign markets. Cable advices report the first of these consignments selling at very satisfactory prices, and your directors are hopeful of a profitable extension of the company's business in this direction. The negotiations for floating the company's debenture issue on the London market were successfully concluded at the close of the financial year.

SUDDEN DEATH AT GLOUCESTER.—Henry Robinson, aged 54 years, by occupation a gardener, living on the Painswick Road, died in a shockingly sudden manner on Thursday week. He had for some time past complained to his wife of cough and cold, and when last under medical treatment it was for cold and gout. He was in the employ of Mr. Wibby, timber merchant, and went to work as usual at six o'clock on Thursday week. About 10.40 that morning he was engaged in the Madleaze Road moving a piece of timber. In this work he used a lever, and as the timber was moved the lever swung round and he fell. He got up on his hands and knees, however, but immediately fell down again. Mr. Wibby was present at once went to him, and others who were to him, and brandy was procured and a cab obtained, but he was found to be dead. There were no marks of injury on the body.

DOCK STRIKES.—On Saturday the men employed in unloading pitwood at the Cardiff Docks, about 150 in number, struck work for increased pay, and they remained out on strike all day on Saturday. Late on Friday night a meeting of the men was held to formulate grievances, and a delegation from them was received by the merchants on Saturday, when the conference was postponed till this morning. The interview was of a friendly character. The merchants expressed regret that they should have been put to the inconvenience of a strike without any notice whatever, and that the men should be governed in the matter from Bristol. The deputation stated that until they had orders from Bristol they were not in a position to formulate any demands. A meeting of the executive of the union would be held on Saturday in Bristol, and they hoped that by Monday morning they would be in a position to meet the committee and formally state what their grievances are. Excellent order and quiet prevails, though the trade of the port is at a standstill.
THE strike of dockers still continues at Gloucester, notwithstanding the fact that their sole reason for turning out had been to show sympathy with their fellow-workmen at Bristol. In course of time the men formulated some demands for increased wages, but, at a conference between masters and men, the latter, according to the merchants' account, distinctly undertook that they would give the merchants time to consider these demands, and the strike should not be prolonged beyond a settlement of the dispute at Bristol. This was repudiated by the men, and they did not return to work. They demand an increase of wages to all class of workmen employed at the port, the abolition of the system of piece-work now in vogue in timber yards, and that all non-union men shall be discharged. The merchants have not yet given an answer to these demands, but the men express a determination to stand out till these points are conceded. In the meantime the most urgent work has been performed by a few non-union men and clerks. Messrs. M'Carthy, of London, and J. W. White, of Bristol, addressed the men on Wednesday, assuring them that funds would be forthcoming.
