Blanc, the president, was in the chair.\nThe Secretary (Mr. Carter) read a paper by Mr. F. C. Cadell on the subject of forestry in its relation to agriculture.\nMr. Cadell pointed out that the conditions of forestry in this country were more indirect than direct, but indirectly they exercised a very powerful and very beneficial effect on the operations of agriculture.\nThere was a wide difference between the estimates of the value of the land which could be planted in this country, and also in the return to be derived from forested land.\nAt the same time he pointed out that we imported timber and forest products to an enormous value, and that about a third of the total area of the land was set down as barren, mountainland, and a great part of which, he suggested, might be profitably planted.\nReturning, however, to the more particular subject of his paper, he referred to the shelter which plantations afforded to crops against the destructive effect of the wind.\nHe argued that planting in this feature was a fertiliser of land.\nA wood, he said, had a regenerating influence, and prevented erosion of the surface soil by heavy rains.\nForestry would have a further advantage in employing a number of men.\n\nB H [?]\nDUN[?]\nImporters of [?]\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and [?]\nWainscot Flooring, and Pitch Pine\nGreenheart, and [?]\n\nA. & W.
