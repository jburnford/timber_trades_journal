REVIEW OF EDINBURGH NURSERIES.
JAMES DICKSON & SONS.
ANOTHER of the important plant producing establishments in Edinburgh is that belonging to the old firm of James Dickson & Sons, who started their business in 1801, and has maintained continuously a flourishing condition, enjoying a wide-spread reputation.
They possess two nurseries, both of which are at Inverleith, and which cover a space of 30 acres.
These nurseries are devoted to the cultivation of trees, shrubs, fruit-trees, and roses, and are beautifully laid out.
The cultivation of the forest tree is carried out on an extensive scale, and amongst the varieties is a large collection of the Douglas fir, now becoming a great favourite in the market, and of which they possess no less than 100,000 plants.
The other varieties of trees which they have it is unnecessary to enumerate, including oak, elm, beech, larch, sycamore, and, in fact, every known variety of plant both for economic and ornamental use.
The soil of Inverleith, it is quite evident from the healthy and vigorous appearance of the plants, is peculiarly adapted to their rearing.
We notice from the operations in progress at the nurseries that very great importance is attached to the rotation of crops, which experience has taught to be a very judicious course for the healthy cultivation of forest trees.
During their long career the firm have engaged in extensive planting operations throughout England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, and are known to all great timber producing landlords of the kingdom.
Mr. Milne, the principal partner, takes great interest in the affairs connected with arboriculture.
A visit to these nurseries is one affording great pleasure to the visitor, and the systematic way in which the whole business is carried on shows that much study has been devoted to the subject.
The success seen in every department of the cultivation of the forest tree shows that the highest scientific knowledge of the subject has been carried into practice.
Of course, in addition to the forest tree department, the whole business of florists, landscape gardening, and general nurserymen is carried on.
In looking at the vast number of forest plants at all stages of growth kept in stock in these nurseries, and considering the limited area of forest lands throughout the country, one cannot resist wondering where sufficient outlet is found, but it is to be hoped that those interested will become alive to the importance and necessity of lessening the area of waste land by increasing the forest area, which the capacity of firms such as this are well able to facilitate by their great energy and enterprise in supplying tree plants reared on the highest scientific principles.

[DECEMBER 14, 1889.]
ROYAL SCOTTISH SOCIETY OF ARTS.
THE third meeting of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts took place this week in the hall of the society, George Street, Edinburgh.
Mr. Hippolyte J. Blanc, the president, was in the chair.
The Secretary (Mr. Carter) read a paper by Mr. F. C. Cadell on the subject of forestry in its relation to agriculture.
Mr. Cadell pointed out that the conditions of forestry in this country were more indirect than direct, but indirectly they exercised a very powerful and very beneficial effect on the operations of agriculture.
There was a wide difference between the estimates of the value of the land which could be planted in this country, and also in the return to be derived from forested land.
At the same time he pointed out that we imported timber and forest products to an enormous value, and that about a third of the total area of the land was set down as barren, mountainland, and a great part of which, he suggested, might be profitably planted.
Returning, however, to the more particular subject of his paper, he referred to the shelter which plantations afforded to crops against the destructive effect of the wind.
He argued that planting in this feature was a fertiliser of land.
A wood, he said, had a regenerating influence, and prevented erosion of the surface soil by heavy rains.
Forestry would have a further advantage in employing a number of men.
