James Kennedy & Co., Glasgow, have secured a very fine lot of larch growing on the shores of the Clyde near Dunoon.\nThis lot is under condition to be removed in an unusually short period.\n\nAt Dundee on Tuesday first Mr. John Jessiman will have his annual Christmas sale, when he will offer a large assortment of American and Baltic timber, including a proportion of \"no reserve\" lots.\nThis yearly event usually commands a large company of his numerous friends in the north.\n\nThe engine of the saw-mills of Messrs. R. Millar & Sons, Montrose, broke down on Wednesday, which necessitates the stoppage of these important works for a week, while the repairs are being executed.\n\nTRADE REPORTS.\nDUNDEE.\n\nThe principal item to report in connection with the timber trade here this week is the public sale held by Bell & Sime on Monday last, being their annual Christmas gathering.\nThere was a very large turnout of buyers from Dundee and the adjoining counties, a few representatives being also present from the Glasgow district.\nThe goods offered included a full assortment of the usual Baltic and American imports.\nThe sale commenced at eleven o'clock and continued uninterruptedly until three.\nThe proceedings were brisk and animated, and a large volume of wood changed hands; the basis of general prices ruled very similar to previous sales and the present existing scale.\nA large business was also done in sawn and manufactured goods, and a number of balances were cleared out.\nWaney board pine fetched from 2s. 10d. to 2s. 11d., Quebec birch 1s. 10 1/2d., 9x3 red deals common 2 1/2d., 11x3 red common 3 1/2d., white battens 6x2 1/2 at 1 5/8d., white 6x2 at 1 5/8d., 5x2 at 1 5/8d., 4x2 at 1 1/2d., 1 1/2 white flooring at 12 1/2d. per yard.\nAfter the sale the company were conveyed to the Queen's Hotel, where the annual dinner took place, an account of which is given in another column.\nThe imports for the season are practically over, but the stocks are somewhat heavier than usual.\nThe trade prospects, however, are good, and it is anticipated that the demand will be equal to the supply before next season's imports can be expected.\n\nGLASGOW.\n\nDeliveries have been going on actively, the quantities recently carted from Yorkhill, &c., showing a decided increase compared with corresponding period last year.\nImports since last writing have been unimportant, the season being now over.\nA few parcels of American oak planks per steam liners are the chief items in the past week's list.\nArrivals of walnut and whitewood logs, &c., per steamships from the States usually begin to bulk more largely at this season, when the trade from Montreal comes to a stop, and there are more vessels on the States route.\nOf late the arrivals of walnut and whitewood logs have been very light, and there is a fair opening for such at present.\nOn referring to the imports at corresponding date last year we observe that upwards of 500 logs walnut, whitewood, &c., came to hand per one steamer.\nDuring the past season the imports from Quebec as regards log timber have been\n\nSCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\nTimber Merchants & Teak Importers\nRailway Wagon and Carriage Oak Scantlings.\n\nAll dimensions from 22 to 70 ft. long,\n3 to 18 in. diam., always in stock.\n\nmoderate to meet demands till next season comes round.\nThe following is an approximate note:—\n1889. 1888.\nQuebec waney boardwood Logs. 9,700 14,000\n,, square yellow pine ,, 18,000 13,300\n,, red pine ,, 4,400 3,600\n,, oak ,, 7,300 3,300\n,, elm ,, 3,700 3,000\n,, ash ,, 3,600 3,400\nThe activity that characterises all departments of trade gives a promising outlook for the disposal of the various wood goods now in stock.\nParticulars of quantities held will be furnished at the end of this month as usual.\n\nGREENOCK.\n\nThere is little or no change to report in the position of the timber trade here since our last writing.\nOrders are not very numerous, but while few in number their extent is very considerable, particularly the lines placed with a number of shipbuilders here, in Dumbarton and the upper reaches of the river.\nA steady consumption is going on, and prices remain unchanged, with a quiet confidence in the future prospects of the trade.\nLarge quantities of pitch pine have been sold.\nNone of this wood has arrived for some time, and with only two cargoes now on passage to this port we anticipate that when the quarterly statement is published this stock will show such a large reduction that a stiffening of prices will ensue.\nThere is still a considerable quantity of timber leaving the ponds, but this will now naturally fall off to a great extent till after the New Year holidays.\nWe are still without any fresh arrivals of wood goods.\n\nLEITH.\n\nThere is an almost entire absence of further arrivals of wood goods, the imports for the week being restricted to a small parcel of oak from Copenhagen and some oddments by the regular steamers.\nFrom the \"Distribution of Imports,\" published in last week's Journal, it is evident that the tide of importation of wood into this port has turned, and a continuance of the ebb may be counted upon to the close of the year.\nAll the same, the excess of importation for the year will not be less than 25 per cent. over 1888.\nFortunately the whole of that excess has not gone into stock, but that there is a substantial increase of stocks in importers' hands no one who looks round the docks and yards can pretend to doubt.\nIn view of the higher prices insisted upon by shippers for next season, there need be no anxiety on the part of holders of stock, but it would be well for importers to get a fair advance on values on this side before entering into contracts with shippers' agents at higher prices.\nThe public sale this week was held by Mr. D. W. Beattie on Tuesday, 17th inst., at the Edinburgh Dock.\nThere was not a large attendance, and the quantity of goods disposed of was correspondingly restricted.\nFor what was sold fair prices were got, the broker being firm in insisting on his limits.\nThis is the last auction of the year here, and the following are a note of prices obtained:—\nPer lin. ft.\n11x3 1st Petersburg white deals 8 1/2d.\n9x2 1/2 1st Petersburg white battens 1 3/4d.\n9x2 ,, ,, ,, 1d.\n11x3 joisting red deals ,, 7/8d.\n10x3 ,, ,, ,, 8 1/2d.\n9x3 Riga white deals ,, 2d.\n8x3 ,, ,, ,, 2 1/2d.\n7x2 1/2 Swedish white battens 1 5/8d.\n6x2 1/2 ,, ,, ,, 1 1/4d.\n4x2 1/2 Laurvig ,, ,, 1 1/2d.\n6x2 Abo red battens 1 1/4d.\n\n[DECEMBER 21, 1889.\nCitizen Buildings,\n24, St. Vincent Place, GLASGOW.\nAnd 4, Old Chester St., EDINBURGH.\nTelegraphic Address—\"SIAM.\"\n\nFLEMING & BARRY,\nCAMPERDOWN SAW-MILLS, DUNDEE.\n\nFORTHCOMING AUCTION SALES.\nDUNDEE John Jessiman DECEMBER Tuesday 24th\nLEITH Forslind & Rex JANUARY.
