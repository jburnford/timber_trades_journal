2 The Timber Trades Journal
FRANCIS BRIGGS & CO.
BALTIC SPARS

Messrs. James Kennedy & Co., Glasgow, have secured a very fine lot of larch growing on the shores of the Clyde near Dunoon.
This lot is under condition to be removed in an unusually short period.

At Dundee on Tuesday first Mr. John Jessiman will have his annual Christmas sale, when he will offer a large assortment of American and Baltic timber, including a proportion of "no reserve" lots.
This yearly event usually commands a large company of his numerous friends in the north.

The engine of the saw-mills of Messrs. R. Millar & Sons, Montrose, broke down on Wednesday, which necessitates the stoppage of these important works for a week, while the repairs are being executed.

TRADE REPORTS.
DUNDEE.

The principal item to report in connection with the timber trade here this week is the public sale held by Bell & Sime on Monday last, being their annual Christmas gathering.
There was a very large turnout of buyers from Dundee and the adjoining counties, a few representatives being also present from the Glasgow district.
The goods offered included a full assortment of the usual Baltic and American imports.
The sale commenced at eleven o'clock and continued uninterruptedly until three.
The proceedings were brisk and animated, and a large volume of wood changed hands; the basis of general prices ruled very similar to previous sales and the present existing scale.
A large business was also done in sawn and manufactured goods, and a number of balances were cleared out.
Waney board pine fetched from 2s. 10d. to 2s. 11d., Quebec birch 1s. 10 1/2d., 9x3 red deals common 2 1/2d., 11x3 red common 3 1/2d., white battens 6x2 1/2 at 1 5/8d., white 6x2 at 1 5/8d., 5x2 at 1 5/8d., 4x2 at 1 1/2d., 1 1/2 white flooring at 12 1/2d. per yard.
After the sale the company were conveyed to the Queen's Hotel, where the annual dinner took place, an account of which is given in another column.
The imports for the season are practically over, but the stocks are somewhat heavier than usual.
The trade prospects, however, are good, and it is anticipated that the demand will be equal to the supply before next season's imports can be expected.

GLASGOW.

Deliveries have been going on actively, the quantities recently carted from Yorkhill, &c., showing a decided increase compared with corresponding period last year.
Imports since last writing have been unimportant, the season being now over.
A few parcels of American oak planks per steam liners are the chief items in the past week's list.
Arrivals of walnut and whitewood logs, &c., per steamships from the States usually begin to bulk more largely at this season, when the trade from Montreal comes to a stop, and there are more vessels on the States route.
Of late the arrivals of walnut and whitewood logs have been very light, and there is a fair opening for such at present.
On referring to the imports at corresponding date last year we observe that upwards of 500 logs walnut, whitewood, &c., came to hand per one steamer.
During the past season the imports from Quebec as regards log timber have been

moderate to meet demands till next season comes round.
The following is an approximate note:—

The activity that characterises all departments of trade gives a promising outlook for the disposal of the various wood goods now in stock.
Particulars of quantities held will be furnished at the end of this month as usual.

GREENOCK.

There is little or no change to report in the position of the timber trade here since our last writing.
Orders are not very numerous, but while few in number their extent is very considerable, particularly the lines placed with a number of shipbuilders here, in Dumbarton and the upper reaches of the river.
A steady consumption is going on, and prices remain unchanged, with a quiet confidence in the future prospects of the trade.
Large quantities of pitch pine have been sold.
None of this wood has arrived for some time, and with only two cargoes now on passage to this port we anticipate that when the quarterly statement is published this stock will show such a large reduction that a stiffening of prices will ensue.
There is still a considerable quantity of timber leaving the ponds, but this will now naturally fall off to a great extent till after the New Year holidays.
We are still without any fresh arrivals of wood goods.

LEITH.

There is an almost entire absence of further arrivals of wood goods, the imports for the week being restricted to a small parcel of oak from Copenhagen and some oddments by the regular steamers.
From the "Distribution of Imports," published in last week's Journal, it is evident that the tide of importation of wood into this port has turned, and a continuance of the ebb may be counted upon to the close of the year.
All the same, the excess of importation for the year will not be less than 25 per cent. over 1888.
Fortunately the whole of that excess has not gone into stock, but that there is a substantial increase of stocks in importers' hands no one who looks round the docks and yards can pretend to doubt.
In view of the higher prices insisted upon by shippers for next season, there need be no anxiety on the part of holders of stock, but it would be well for importers to get a fair advance on values on this side before entering into contracts with shippers' agents at higher prices.
The public sale this week was held by Mr. D. W. Beattie on Tuesday, 17th inst., at the Edinburgh Dock.
There was not a large attendance, and the quantity of goods disposed of was correspondingly restricted.
For what was sold fair prices were got, the broker being firm in insisting on his limits.
This is the last auction of the year here, and the following are a note of prices obtained:—
