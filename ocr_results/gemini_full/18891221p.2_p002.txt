MESSRS. BELL & SIME'S ANNUAL CHRISTMAS DINNER.
On Monday afternoon, at the close of their sale, Messrs. Bell & Sime, Dundee, entertained their customers in the Queen's Hotel. Mr. Sime presided, and Mr. Bell officiated as croupier. Amongst the gentlemen present, who numbered about 100, were the Rev. S. Galloway, Lord Dean of Guild McGrady, Councillor Keith, Mr. Sime, junr.; Mr. Shaw, Dundee; Mr. Howe, Dundee; Mr. Pullar, Perth; Mr. Thomas Winton, Dundee; Mr. T. Harris, St. Andrews; Mr. Forgan, Perth; Mr. Suttie, Buckhaven; Mr. Williamson, Timber Trades Journal; Mr. Provost Brownlee; Mr. Bruce, Coatbridge, &c.
After a sumptuous dinner, served up in a style characteristic of Mr. Smith, the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were proposed from the chair and duly honoured.
Mr. Shaw proposed "The Lord Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council of Dundee," to which Councillor Keith responded, and in his reply referred to the subject of electric lighting. He called attention to the large amount of money being paid by the Council for gas, and obtained advice from the highest authorities, and he hoped they would arrive at a decision on the matter. He also referred to several other improvements that were at present receiving the attention of the Council.
Mr. Pullar, proposed "Continued Success to the Firm of Messrs. Bell & Sime." He said he had much pleasure in doing so. They had had the utmost success, and it was very gratifying to see that many of the gentlemen who had succeeded so well themselves, giving a warm word of encouragement to others. He felt sure that all who did business with the firm rejoiced in their success. They seemed to be getting on better and better every year. They had introduced the electric light into their works, and whenever any important invention was brought out they were among the first to secure the new appliances, so that their work might be conducted in the best, as well as in the most economical, way. He asked the company to drink a hearty bumper to the success of the firm.
The toast was enthusiastically responded to, the company joining in singing "For they are jolly good fellows."
Mr. Sime, in reply, said it had always been, and always would be, the endeavour of the firm to merit the good opinion of their customers. Like every other business, the timber trade was subject to change, and the timber trade was to business.
