(Limited) for the P. & O. Co. ; the large and beautifully moulded fleet of steamers launched by Scott & Co. for the Mala Real Portugueza of Lisbon ; the two gunboats for our own Government, &c.\nThe following figures show the total output of the various yards in Greenock and Port Glasgow during the year, just closed, viz. :—\n1889. 1888.\nTons.
