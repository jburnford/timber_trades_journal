ing up the timber they require for the resumption of work after the holidays.
A considerable quantity of yellow pine is being shipped here by steamer to Barrow.
No further timber cargoes have yet arrived.
1889 has witnessed a remarkable development of the shipbuilding industry, and, as far as Greenock and Port Glasgow district is concerned, the year has been the most prosperous on record; the total new tonnage built and launched being 124,682 tons, an increase of 38,720 tons over the previous year, and beating the record of 1883 by 9,468 tons.
The new tonnage represents 41 steamers and 25 sailing vessels—66 in all.
Included in these are many magnificent specimens of naval architecture worthily sustaining the prestige of our local shipbuilders, such as the four splendid steamers built by Caird & Co. (Limited) for the P. & O. Co. ; the large and beautifully moulded fleet of steamers launched by Scott & Co. for the Mala Real Portugueza of Lisbon ; the two gunboats for our own Government, &c.
The following figures show the total output of the various yards in Greenock and Port Glasgow during the year, just closed, viz. :—

Net increase compared with 1888, 38,720 tons.
Russell & Co. have again the largest tonnage of any shipbuilder on the Clyde.
At present there are about 70,000 tons of shipping on the stocks in yards here and Port Glasgow, and judging by the orders in hand we can confidently look forward to a continuance of the existing briskness during the ensuing year.

LEITH.
The arrivals this week have been of the most trifling description, consisting merely of a small parcel of laths by steamer from Riga, some hoops and other oddments.
Business, as might have been expected during the Christmas week, has been very quiet, the deliveries chiefly consisting of wood for the new exhibition buildings.
There has been no public sale this week and no change to report regarding prices.
Shippers' agents for having, in many cases, received their stock notes, are trying to push business for the coming season, but, so far as can be ascertained, importers in this district are abstaining, in the meantime, from making any contracts, which would seem to be the most prudent course.

The Lord Provost of Glasgow stated at a meeting of the town council on Monday last that he would subscribe £20,000 to a fund for building an art gallery in Glasgow if three other citizens each gave a similar sum.
He believed that with the surplus from the Exhibition and the subscriptions he and others there might give they might raise £200,000.
