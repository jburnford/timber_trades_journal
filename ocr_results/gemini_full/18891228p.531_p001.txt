HUDSON & KEARNS' ARCHITECT'S DIARY AND BLOTTING PADS.
Christmas has again brought us samples of the diaries and blotting pads published by Messrs. Hudson & Kearns, 83, Southwark Street, London, S.E. The fame which these publications have already achieved will be further increased by the admirable manner in which the issues for 1890 have been brought down to date in the matter of comprehensive and useful information affecting architects, civil engineers, surveyors, timber merchants, builders, and contractors. No. 13 diary is specially valuable from its fulness in other respects. It commences with an index, followed by the diary, in which two pages are devoted to each day. The left hand page is split thus :
Appointments. Details of Business
Hour. Name. transacted.
On the right page the headlines are :
Posted.
Cash. Folio. Received. Paid.
At the end pages are devoted to a monthly summary of cash transactions, notes, a rent and fire insurance register and ledger.
This diary might almost be styled a compendium of a set of office books, and in common with the other diaries of this firm, which, though containing less leaves, are arranged on similar lines, should be extremely welcome to those for whom it has been specially compiled.
The blotting pads issuing from this firm are characterised by the same useful and ingenious arrangement, combining a pad, tablet, calendar, diary interleaved with blotting, and memo slate. The price of both the diaries and pads will be found most reasonable, and we recommend all our readers to obtain copies of each publication.

ELECTRIC LIGHTING IN SAW-MILLS.—In reply to the query on page 481 we would refer our correspondent to an account of the electric lighting of J. Mitchell & Co.'s mill at Leith in a recent issue. In that instance the dynamo is driven directly from the main shafting, and the light is, therefore, only available when the mill is going. Accumulators could be arranged with such an installation, but they would require a lot of attention, more or less skilled, and would be far more troublesome and costly, both in erection and maintenance, than a separate steam engine. This arrangement of a separate engine would render the light available for use when the main shafting had stopped, or in case of a break-down to engine or mill, when its use would be specially necessary. Messrs. J. Mitchell & Co.'s installation, which has given them the utmost satisfaction, was fitted by King, Brown, & Co., Rosebank Electric Works, Edinburgh, who, we have no doubt, would be pleased to answer any inquiries.

SEVERAL ingenious machines for the various operations in the match manufacture have already been invented in Scandinavia, and more are shortly expected. Both in Sweden and Norway machines for packing the matches have recently been tried, and it is understood with very good results. The Norwegian machine is the invention of two young engineers at Gjovik, and is said to be able to pack 1,000 boxes per minute, which is equal to the work of 40 packers. The other machine is invented by a Swedish engineer of Stockholm, but can probably not compete with the former.
