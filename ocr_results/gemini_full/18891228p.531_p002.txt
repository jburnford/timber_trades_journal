CORRESPONDENCE.
REFUSING TO SHIP.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—Referring to the complaint by your correspondent of non-shipment of goods, I recommend him to take the case to the Swedish Courts, where I have already been successful under somewhat similar circumstances. In the event of claims being small I would recommend that the names of the delinquents be published in the Timber Trades Journal; and perhaps you could adorn your already splendid calendar with their portraits once a year.—I am, &c.,
JUSTICE.

[DECEMBER 28,
FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
(It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.)
BALL, A. H. W., builder, 182, Villiers Road, Willesden Lane, N.W.—The receiving order in this case was made upon the petition of Messrs. Farquharson Brothers & Co., timber merchants, Bishopsgate Street, and the bankrupt applied last week to Mr. Registrar Giffard for his order of discharge. The liabilities were £765, but proofs for £480 9s. 7d. have been admitted, and the assets were put down at £850, but £830 of the amount is represented by equities of redemption, from which nothing has been realised. The bankrupt began business as a builder in 1882, in partnership with his brother, as A. & J. Ball. In March, 1884, he was adjudged bankrupt on a petition filed by the firm, the liabilities being £1,178 and the assets £138 7s., and a dividend was paid of one penny in the pound. He began business again as a builder, by himself, in January, 1888, with £210 capital, and commenced by building two houses at Fulham, which, he states, he sold in July, 1889, at a loss of £130. In October, 1888 with a balance of £60 or £70, he started building certain houses at Kilburn under a building agreement. In consequence of these houses not being completed within the time specified, the mortgagee took possession, and the bankrupt attributes his failure to his inability through want of capital to complete the houses and the consequent seizure by the mortgagee. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had omitted to keep books, and that having regard to his previous failure and the small amount of capital at his disposal, he was not justified in again carrying on business as a speculative builder; consequently he thought that he had to some extent contributed to his own failure by rash and hazardous speculations. Mr. H. Reed appeared in support of the application, and Mr. Adams for the Official Receiver. His Honour said he did not think, under the circumstances, that the bankrupt was justified in incurring liabilities which he could only hope to have paid by the indulgence of the mortgagees, or by a stroke of luck. He did not think because a man had a slight knowledge of building, and how houses were built, that he was entitled to build on the chance of making a little money, the result to his creditors being, in the event of the speculation proving unsuccessful, that they lost their money. He thought there had been a degree of rashness on the bankrupt's part, and suspended his discharge for nine months.
DALWOOD, E. G., builder, 17, Arthur Street, Walworth.—The first meeting of creditors in this case was held on Friday before Mr. Brougham, Assistant Receiver. The debtor, who made no offer, attributes his insolvency to bad debts and a loss upon a contract for the completion of a building. Creditors :—
£ s. d.
C. Park Road, Hackney ... ... 46 18 4
S. Hill Street, Walworth ... ... 12 12 0
56, Camberwell Road, S E. ... 28 14 9
, Blucher Street, Walworth ... 32 8 6
The matter will be wound up in bankruptcy by the Official Receiver as trustee.
DEWEY, S. T., builder and surveyor, 46, Queen Victoria Street, E.C.—The receiving order in this case was made upon the petition of Mr. T. W. Forman, timber merchant, Walnut Tree Walk, Kennington, and the bankrupt's public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. Liabilities £4,584, of which £1,334 are unsecured, and assets estimated at £22. The bankrupt began his present business in October, 1886, with about £40 capital, and he attributed his insolvency to his inability to sell or obtain further advances on houses, and to law costs and depreciation in value; also to law costs and bad debts. Mr. Howell appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Broxholm for the bankrupt. On being examined by Mr. Howell, the bankrupt said that he had commenced to build houses at Barking on a building agreement, and received from £2,400 to £2,500, but he expended considerably more than that upon the houses, and was obliged to stop in consequence of the freeholder refusing to make further advances. Some years ago he filed a petition in the Bristol County Court. In answer to Mr. Broxholm, the bankrupt went on to say that he had been informed by the trustee under that failure that he obtained his discharge, or he would not have commenced to trade again. The examination was concluded.
PEARCE, URIAH HARRY TAYLOR, builder, Cutcombe.—This bankrupt was rendered at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court last week before Mr. Registrar Daw for adjourned public examination, having been ordered to furnish certain cash and goods accounts. These he had failed to do, and Mr. Thomas Andrew (Official Receiver) said he could not proceed with the examination till he had the necessary accounts before him. He must ask for another adjournment and a peremptory order on the debtor. The Registrar adjourned the matter till the January Court.
PYLE, RALPH H., builder, Heavitree.—The public examination of the debtor was held at the last sitting of the Exeter Bankruptcy Court. Mr. Campion appeared for a creditor and Mr. Thomas Andrew (Official Receiver) for the Board of Trade. Bankrupt said he had been in business about eight years, and had been in partnership with his brother, they trading as Pyno Bros. This partnership was dissolved in September last. When he commenced he had a capital of £120, and his brother nothing. He attributed his insolvency to depreciation in the value of the household property he held. At the death of his mother he was entitled to a share of a reversion of £386. The examination was closed.
RODWELL, T. H., builder, Flaxman Road and Hardess Street, Camberwell, S E.—The case was made on the receiving order in this matter on the 4th inst., and accounts have now been furnished showing unsecured debts £1,330 16s. 10d., with assets estimated to realise £389 16s. 11d. after providing for preferential payments. The debtor states that he commenced business about 1880 without capital, and he attributes his failure wholly to losses on three contracts at Streatham and Kingston-on-Thames, upon which he has been engaged since February last. A meeting of the creditors was held on the 10th inst., in order to consider a proposal for the purchase of the estate and after considerable discussion the Official Receiver was authorised to accept an offer to purchase the estate for a sum sufficient to pay a dividend of 6s. in the pound on the liabilities, together with the expenses attending these proceedings.
TEMPLEMAN, WILLIAM, builders' merchant, East Reach, Taunton.—At the last sitting of the Taunton Bankruptcy Court, held on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Meyler, this bankrupt attended for his public examination. Mr. G. Philpot, Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, Mr. G. E. Colthurst, trustee, and Mr. G. H. Kite appeared in the interest of the bankrupt, who attributes his failure through being a composition for his Taunton plumbers. The examination was adjourned to allow the trading and profit and loss accounts to be duly furnished, and after a short examination on some of the items allowed to pass, no opposition being raised by the Official Receiver or trustee.
THOMAS & CHIVERS, builders, Locksbrook, wood Road, Bristol.—At the last Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week, before his Honour Judge Caillard, Mr. A. E. Withy made an application to his Honour for the discharge of Thomas Chivers and partner. The deficiency was alleged to have been caused by losses in building, and the bankrupt continued trading after being aware of his position, and without there being any probability of his being able to pay debts so contracted. An order was made for the bankrupt's discharge, with suspension for twelve months.
WADMAN, J. C., contractor, 79, Charlotte Street, Euston Road.—The receiving order in this case was made on November 29th, the debtor being also of late of Skegness, ton, Cumberland, and of Frizing-Accounts have now been furnished showing unsecured debts £398 15s. 10d., and assets £169 17s. 6d., after providing for preferential payments. The debtor, who states that he commenced business in 1886 with £50 capital, attributes his insolvency to losses on a contract at £200) on a contract to erect an iron church at Skegness. He has been adjudged bankrupt, and the Court has made an order for summary administration.
WARD, THOMAS, builder, of 12, Mervan Road, Brixton.—Particulars of this matter have just been issued. The gross liabilities amount to £10,576 6s. 9d., creditors unsecured £541 6s. 9d., creditors fully secured £9,725, assets nil, and the deficiency £481. The receiving order was made on the petition of Messrs. T. W. Ellston & Co., of Bermondsey, timber merchants. The debtor states that he commenced business in June 1885 with a capital of about £400, and that he stopped building in June last, and had been endeavouring since then to obtain a situation, but without effect. A wages book and ledger have been produced, but contain very little information in regard to the debtor's affairs.

affairs. The securities consist of fully secured charges on leasehold property at Oxford, Fulham, Putney, and Wimbledon. The debtor executed an ante-nuptial settlement dated about June, 1885. The property settled consisting of leasehold property of the value of about £300, a mortgage on property at Putney respectively (fully secured by mortgage for £3,000), and a life policy for £1,000. The debtor states that at the time of making the settlement he had no creditors. The debtor is a life-tenant under this settlement, and is possessed of the trust estate. In May last the trustees applied to the Court of Chancery, and were appointed receivers of the estate. In July certain houses in respect of which he was indebted of £150, and that in August last he was indebted to a creditor for £700 odd. The trustees collect the rents of the several properties, and pay debts due to the trustees and other creditors out of the rents. The debtor states that in June and September last he was respectively served with bankruptcy notices at the instance of two of his creditors. The debtor states that he is aware of his insolvency, and that he now considers his position desperate. He attributes his failure through unlet properties and forced sales by creditors. The debtor has been requested to give an account of his receipts and expenditure, and of the disposition of the proceeds of property sold by and to him within the twelve months previous to his bankruptcy, but has not done so, and has been ordered to file a cash account and a deficiency.
