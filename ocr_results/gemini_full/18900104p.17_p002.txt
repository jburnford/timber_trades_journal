FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in the lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

DASH, CHARLES MITCHELL, builder, 34, Clarence Square, Gosport.—The receiving order herein was made on the 13th April last, the liabilities being returned at £1,379 7s. 11d., and assets £602 16s. 4d. At the Portsmouth Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday week, before his Honour Judge Gye, Mr. Foster Glanville, solicitor, applied on behalf of the bankrupt for his order of discharge. He said debtor commenced business in 1880, after working as a carpenter and small contractor. He had £45 capital, and after three years began to build. Previous to the receiving order debtor had shown that he was solvent, but he had over-valued his property, and it was notorious that property in the neighbourhood of the bankrupt had his had greatly depreciated. According to the Official Receiver's (Mr. C. J. Moberly) report, the debtor had kept proper books of account, and the principal item in the deficiency account was the difference between the cost and realisable value of the stock and plant. Mr. Wm. Edmonds, the trustee, did not appear in opposition, and his Honour granted the application, but suspended the discharge for six months.

ELPHICK, A., coachbuilder, St. Leonards. —At the Hastings Bankruptcy Court on Monday this failure came before his Honour Judge Martineau. It will be remembered the debtor traded as Elphick & Balkham, the finding the capital and the latter being purely a workman. Mr. S. Stembridge was appointed trustee, and as the result of his investigations he made an equity claim against Mr. Balkham for the adjustment of partnership accounts and the appointment of a receiver. Mr. Jones made the application to the judge, and explained that to the outside world Mr. Balkham appeared as a partner in the firm. His Honour doubted if he had any jurisdiction in the matter, but adjourned the case till the next Court.

FLOWER, ALFRED JOHN WILLIAM SAUNDERS, Constitution Hill, Kinson, Poole.—The receiving order herein was made on the 18th December, and the statement of affairs filed shows gross liabilities £3,042 3s. 9d., of which £573 8s. 1d. is due to creditors unsecured, £7,298 10s. to creditors fully secured, liabilities on bills other than the debtor's own acceptances being £125 (of which £25 is estimated to rank), and preferential claims £45 5s. 8d. The assets are, cash in hand, £1 11s. 1d.; property at estimated cost £195, expected to produce £65 10s.; book debts, £411 11s. 8d., estimated at £8 9s. 3d.; surplus from securities, in the hands of creditors, £1,426. After deducting preferential claims there is an estimated surplus of £857 16s. 10d. The debtor alleges that the causes of his failure are loss through fire and suspension of work, and in connection with building speculations. The Official Receiver's observations are:—"The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition. Further particulars will be required as to the alleged causes of failure. I am of the opinion that the above summary of the debtor's affairs, as stated and estimated by him, will prove to be incorrect and misleading, when compared with the actual realisation of the estate. The item £1,426 on the assets side represents the amount which the debtor estimates will be realised for a number of freehold and leasehold properties after the claims of the mortgagees have been satisfied. Many statements of a similar description in connection with builders' businesses in the neighbourhood of Bournemouth have come under my notice, but only in comparatively few instances have the unsecured debts been paid in full, and in many instances little or no dividend paid. I have already had two claims made to effects taken possession of under the receiving order. The debtor states it is his intention to make a
