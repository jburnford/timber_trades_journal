Foster Glanville, solicitor, applied on behalf of the bankrupt for his order of discharge.\nHe said debtor commenced business in 1880, chiefly working as a carpenter and small contractor.\nHe had £45 capital, and, after three years, began to build.\nPrevious to the receiving order debtor had shown that he was solvent, but he had over-valued his property, and it was notorious that property in the neighbourhood bankrupt had had greatly depreciated.\nAccording to the Official Receiver's (Mr. J. C. Moberly) report, the debtor had kept proper books of account, and the principal item in the deficiency account was the difference between the cost and realisable value of the stock and plant.\nMr. Wm. Edmonds, the trustee, did not appear in opposition, and his Honour granted the application, but suspended the discharge for six months.\n\nELPHICK, A., coachbuilder, St. Leonards.\n—At the Hastings Bankruptcy Court on Monday this failure came before his Honour Judge Martineau.\nIt will be remembered the debtor traded as Elphick & Balkham, he finding the capital and the latter being purely a workman.\nMr. S. Stembridge was appointed trustee, and, as the result of his investigations, he made an equity claim against Mr. Balkham for the adjustment of partnership accounts and to the appointment of a receiver.\nMr. Jones made the application to the judge, and explained that to the outside world Mr. Balkham appeared as a partner in the firm.\nHis Honour doubted if he had any jurisdiction in the matter, but adjourned the case till the next Court.\n\nELLIS, WILLIAM HENRY, coachbuilder, Union Street, Faversham, Kent.—The following are the creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nGorringe R. & Co., Islington — about 150 0 0\nGascige T.

C. Eaton to erect six houses for £730; being unable to complete the contract, and having drawn all that he was entitled to, he instituted these proceedings on his own petition.\nThe debtor commenced business at Norwich as a carpenter and builder in September, 1887, with a capital of about £60.\nThe debtor hardly accounts for his deficiency by an estimated loss of £150 on Mr. Eaton's contract, and a loss of £70 upon the realisation of his effects.\nNo offer will be made.\nThe debtor has been adjudged bankrupt, and an order obtained for the summary administration of the estate.\nThe following are creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBarrett J., Saw-mills, Norwich — — 11 3 5\nEaton G. H., Norwich — — 60 0 0\nLacey J. W., Norwich — — 36 4 5\nRump R., Norwich — — 12 7 0\nSexton R. E., Norwich — — 16 9 0\nWright & Turner, Norwich — — 203 4 0\n\nGREEN & LEE, builders and contractors, Amherst Road, Hackney, N.E.—The receiving order in this case was made on the 7th November, and accounts have now been furnished, showing unsecured debts £10,985 16s. 6d., and debts fully secured £2,716 10s. 8d., the assets, after providing for preferential payments, being estimated at £4,545 7s. 3d.\nThe debtors state that they entered into partnership in May, 1887.\nThe capital of the firm appears to have amounted to £6,764 9s. 1d., of which £3,554 16s. 9d. represented the value of plant, machinery, and stock-in-trade of the business (which had previously been carried on by Green in partnership with his nephew), and £3,000, cash brought in by Lee, who, in addition, paid £1,000 as premium.\nThe debtors attribute their failure to losses on contracts, particularly in respect of buildings at South Audley Street.\nThe usual and proper books of account have been kept.\nOf the unsecured indebtedness, £3,436 11s. 11d. is stated to be due to creditors who may seek to claim a right to be paid out of balances due to the firm in respect of the South Audley Street contract, amounting, as estimated, to £1,008 18s. 9d.\nThe security held by creditors (the firm's bankers) appearing as \"fully secured\" is stated to be the leases of the works at Anton Street and yard at Montague Street, the realisable value of which, for the purposes of the statement of affairs, is estimated at the amount of the debt.\nIt is stated that the creditors have given notice that they intend to exercise their power of sale.\nThe preferential claims include an amount, £400, representing an estimated balance due to the Receiver appointed under an Order of the Chancery Division, dated 30th October last.\nThe asset, \"other property\" (£2,337 5s. 9d.), represents the amount of the estimated balances due or which will be payable to the firm in respect of various contracts (including the sum of £1,008 18s. 9d. above referred to), after allowing for cost of completion.\nIt appearing to be desirable, and in the interests of the creditors, Mr. Ernest W. Collins, of 19a, Coleman Street, E.C., accountant, was appointed special manager of the estate and business of the debtors.\n\nHEATH, JOHN, builder, 169, Barnsbury Road, N.—The debtor, late of 178, Liverpool Road, had a receiving order made against his estate on November 29, and the accounts now filed show unsecured debts £1,144 7s., and a debt fully secured £161 5s.; against assets £1,229 17s. 5d.\nThe debtor states that with £100 capital he commenced business about six years ago, which he carried on until July, 1888, when he sold his stock, furniture, &c., for £70, using the proceeds in payment of debts and in living expenses, and has since been out of business.\nThe principal asset is said to be a book debt for £1,223, representing the minimum amount due to the debtor in respect of work executed between January and May, 1888, at the late Irish Exhibition, his claim thereto being the subject of a pending action under which it has been referred by the Judge to the chief clerk to certify as to the amount due, which is thereupon to be paid.\nThe debtor attributes his failure entirely to the non-payment of the said claim, in respect of which, he states, nearly the whole of his present indebtedness was contracted.\n\nKENT, THOMAS, builder, Hastings.—At the Hastings Bankruptcy Court on Monday this bankrupt applied to Judge Martineau for his order of discharge.\nMr. A. S. Cully, Assistant Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, and opposed the application on the ground that the debtor had been guilty of rash and hazardous speculation, had given undue preference to a creditor, continued trading after becoming aware of his insolvency, and other grounds, as fully explained in the Official Receiver's report.\nThe debtor commenced business with a capital of £120, and had built £26,000 worth of property; thus for every 7s. 6d. of capital the debtor's trading had been £100.\nThe bankrupt had been a hazardous speculator all through.\nHis Honour said there appeared to be some grounds for the charge of undue preference, but it was a bad case of speculation, and bankrupt must wait two years for his discharge.\n\nLAMERTON, WALTER EDMUND, wholesale cabinet manufacturer, the Steam Cabinet Works, Barton Street, and late Bull Lane, Gloucester.—This debtor's statement of affairs shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £3,575 3s. 11d., and a deficiency of £2,599 11s. 10d.\nThe alleged causes of failure are loss by fire in Bull Lane, bad debts, pressure by creditors, and want of capital.\nThe receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition.\nThe bankrupt started in business as a cabinet-maker, in Gloucester, in 1883, with about £200 capital.\nBankrupt has kept usual trade account books, but they are not balanced so as to show his financial position at any time.\nThere is one creditor (Mr. Morris) for £1,500, who is said to have agreed to waive his claim until the other creditors are paid in full.\nThe works are being continued, under the debtor's superintendence, to complete partly-executed orders only.\nThe debtor recently sold his furniture to Mr. Samuels for £50, taking the same back under a hire agreement, under which he made default in payment.\nHe recently held a private meeting of creditors, with a view to being allowed time for payment in full, but some of the creditors did not agree to this, and three executions have been issued, and several others have sued him.\nUnless someone will take to the plant and stock as a going concern it will produce much less than its fair value.\nAccording to the deficiency account, during the last year his profits amounted to £903; he has borrowed £175 10s.; and he has bor- the deficiency thus:—Excess of liabilities over assets on 10th December, 1889, £1,464; living expenses, £190; expected loss on realising estate, £1,195; costs of actions, &c., £60; discount for cash, £8; extra expenses, £30 10s.; and interest on loans, £64.\nThe following are creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nAshbee & Sons, Gloucester — — 23 1 10\nBell's Asbestos Co., London — — 18 1 10\nBartlett W., High Wycombe — — 47 19 0\nBates J., Wolverhampton — — 14 19 0\nBooth & Co., Gloucester — — 309 0 3\nClarke & Timmins, Birmingham — — 10 0 0\nColthurst & Harding, Bristol — — 16 10 0\nCox & Son, High Wycombe — — 10 0 0\nCooper & Co., Birmingham — — 16 10 0\nCrofts & Assinder, Birmingham — — 47 4 4\nDunn M., West Bromwich — — 10 0 0\nEdwards W.
