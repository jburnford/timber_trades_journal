FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

DASH, CHARLES MITCHELL, builder, 34, Clarence Square, Gosport.—The receiving order herein was made on the 19th April last, the liabilities being returned at £1,319 7s. 7d., and assets £602 16s. 4d.
At the Portsmouth Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday week, Mr. J. Foster Glanville, solicitor, applied on behalf of the bankrupt for his order of discharge.
He said debtor commenced business in 1880, chiefly working as a carpenter and small contractor.
He had £45 capital, and, after three years, began to build.
Previous to the receiving order debtor had shown that he was solvent, but he had over-valued his property, and it was notorious that property in the neighbourhood bankrupt had had greatly depreciated.
According to the Official Receiver's (Mr. J. C. Moberly) report, the debtor had kept proper books of account, and the principal item in the deficiency account was the difference between the cost and realisable value of the stock and plant.
Mr. Wm. Edmonds, the trustee, did not appear in opposition, and his Honour granted the application, but suspended the discharge for six months.

ELPHICK, A., coachbuilder, St. Leonards.
—At the Hastings Bankruptcy Court on Monday this failure came before his Honour Judge Martineau.
It will be remembered the debtor traded as Elphick & Balkham, he finding the capital and the latter being purely a workman.
Mr. S. Stembridge was appointed trustee, and, as the result of his investigations, he made an equity claim against Mr. Balkham for the adjustment of partnership accounts and to the appointment of a receiver.
Mr. Jones made the application to the judge, and explained that to the outside world Mr. Balkham appeared as a partner in the firm.
His Honour doubted if he had any jurisdiction in the matter, but adjourned the case till the next Court.

FLOWER, ALFRED JOHN WILLIAM SAUNDERS, Constitution Hill, Kinson, Poole.—The receiving order herein was made on the 18th December, and the statement of affairs filed shows gross liabilities, £8,042 3s. 9d., of which £673 8s. 1d. is due to creditors unsecured, £7,268 10s. to creditors fully secured, liabilities on bills other than the debtor's own acceptances being £125 (of which £25 is estimated to rank), and preferential claims £45 5s. 9d.
The assets are, cash in hand, £1 11s. 4d.; property at estimated cost £195, expected to produce £65 10s.; book debts, £441 11s. 6d., estimated at £9 9s. 3d.; surplus from securities in the hands of creditors, £1,426.
After deducting preferential claims there is an estimated surplus of £837 15s. 10d.
The debtor alleges that the causes of his failure are loss through fire and suspension of work, and in connection with building speculations.
The Official Receiver's observations are :—" The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition.
Further particulars will be required as to the alleged causes of failure.
I am of the opinion that the above summary of the debtor's affairs, as stated and estimated by him, will prove to be incorrect and misleading, when compared with the actual realisation of the estate.
The item £1,426 on the assets side represents the amount which the debtor estimates will be realised for a number of freehold and leasehold properties after the claims of the mortgagees have been satisfied.
Many statements of a similar description in connection with builders' businesses in the neighbourhood of Bournemouth have come under my notice, but only in comparatively few instances have the unsecured debts been paid in full, and in many instances little or no dividend paid.
I have already had two claims made to effects taken possession of under the receiving order.
The debtor states it is his intention to make a proposal to his creditors, but does not give the nature of the proposal.
The creditors are:—

FOX, GEORGE, the elder, builder, Allen's Lane, Newmarket Road, Heigham, Norwich.—This debtor's statement of affairs shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £972 8s. 9d., and assets £62 8s. 11d., from which £5 13s. is deducted for preferential claims payable in full, which leaves £56 15s. 11d., and shows a deficiency of £915 12s. 10d.
The debtor recently entered into a contract with Mr. G. C. Eaton to erect six houses for £730; being unable to complete the contract, and having drawn all that he was entitled to, he instituted these proceedings on his own petition.
The debtor commenced business at Norwich as a carpenter and builder in September, 1887, with a capital of about £60.
The debtor hardly accounts for his deficiency by an estimated loss of £150 on Mr. Eaton's contract, and a loss of £70 upon the realisation of his effects.
No offer will be made.
The debtor has been adjudged bankrupt, and an order obtained for the summary administration of the estate.
The following are creditors:—
£ s. d.
Barrett J., Saw-mills, Norwich — — 11 3 5
Eaton G. H., Norwich — — 60 0 0
Lacey J. W., Norwich — — 36 4 5

GREEN & LEE, builders and contractors, Amherst Road, Hackney, N.E.—The receiving order in this case was made on the 7th November, and accounts have now been furnished, showing unsecured debts £10,985 16s. 6d., and debts fully secured £2,716 10s. 8d., the assets, after providing for preferential payments, being estimated at £4,545 7s. 3d.
The debtors state that they entered into partnership in May, 1887.
The capital of the firm appears to have amounted to £6,764 9s. 1d., of which £3,554 16s. 9d. represented the value of plant, machinery, and stock-in-trade of the business (which had previously been carried on by Green in partnership with his nephew), and £3,000, cash brought in by Lee, who, in addition, paid £1,000 as premium.
The debtors attribute their failure to losses on contracts, particularly in respect of buildings at South Audley Street.
The usual and proper books of account have been kept.
Of the unsecured indebtedness, £3,436 11s. 11d. is stated to be due to creditors who may seek to claim a right to be paid out of balances due to the firm in respect of the South Audley Street contract, amounting, as estimated, to £1,008 18s. 9d.
The security held by creditors (the firm's bankers) appearing as "fully secured" is stated to be the leases of the works at Anton Street and yard at Montague Street, the realisable value of which, for the purposes of the statement of affairs, is estimated at the amount of the debt.
It is stated that the creditors have given notice that they intend to exercise their power of sale.
The preferential claims include an amount, £400, representing an estimated balance due to the Receiver appointed under an Order of the Chancery Division, dated 30th October last.
The asset, "other property" (£2,337 5s. 9d.), represents the amount of the estimated balances due or which will be payable to the firm in respect of various contracts (including the sum of £1,008 18s. 9d. above referred to), after allowing for cost of completion.
It appearing to be desirable, and in the interests of the creditors, Mr. Ernest W. Collins, of 19a, Coleman Street, E.C., accountant, was appointed special manager of the estate and business of the debtors.

HEATH, JOHN, builder, 169, Barnsbury Road, N.—The debtor, late of 178, Liverpool Road, had a receiving order made against his estate on November 29, and the accounts now filed show unsecured debts £1,144 7s., and a debt fully secured £161 5s.; against assets £1,229 17s. 5d.
The debtor states that with £100 capital he commenced business about six years ago, which he carried on until July, 1888, when he sold his stock, furniture, &c., for £70, using the proceeds in payment of debts and in living expenses, and has since been out of business.
The principal asset is said to be a book debt for £1,223, representing the minimum amount due to the debtor in respect of work executed between January and May, 1888, at the late Irish Exhibition, his claim thereto being the subject of a pending action under which it has been referred by the Judge to the chief clerk to certify as to the amount due, which is thereupon to be paid.
The debtor attributes his failure entirely to the non-payment of the said claim, in respect of which, he states, nearly the whole of his present indebtedness was contracted.

KENT, THOMAS, builder, Hastings.—At the Hastings Bankruptcy Court on Monday this bankrupt applied to Judge Martineau for his order of discharge.
Mr. A. S. Cully, Assistant Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, and opposed the application on the ground that the debtor had been guilty of rash and hazardous speculation, had given undue preference to a creditor, continued trading after becoming aware of his insolvency, and other grounds, as fully explained in the Official Receiver's report.
The debtor commenced business with a capital of £120, and had built £26,000 worth of property; thus for every 7s. 6d. of capital the debtor's trading had been £100.
The bankrupt had been a hazardous speculator all through.
His Honour said there appeared to be some grounds for the charge of undue preference, but it was a bad case of speculation, and bankrupt must wait two years for his discharge.

LAMERTON, WALTER EDMUND, wholesale cabinet manufacturer, the Steam Cabinet Works, Barton Street, and late Bull Lane, Gloucester.—This debtor's statement of affairs shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £3,575 3s. 11d., and a deficiency of £2,599 11s. 10d.
The alleged causes of failure are loss by fire in Bull Lane, bad debts, pressure by creditors, and want of capital.
The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition.
The bankrupt started in business as a cabinet-maker, in Gloucester, in 1883, with about £200 capital.
Bankrupt has kept usual trade account books, but they are not balanced so as to show his financial position at any time.
There is one creditor (Mr. Morris) for £1,500, who is said to have agreed to waive his claim until the other creditors are paid in full.
The works are being continued, under the debtor's superintendence, to complete partly-executed orders only.
The debtor recently sold his furniture to Mr. Samuels for £50, taking the same back under a hire agreement, under which he made default in payment.
He recently held a private meeting of creditors, with a view to being allowed time for payment in full, but some of the creditors did not agree to this, and three executions have been issued, and several others have sued him.
Unless someone will take to the plant and stock as a going concern it will produce much less than its fair value.
According to the deficiency account, during the last year his profits amounted to £903; he has borrowed £175 10s.; and he has bor- the deficiency thus:—Excess of liabilities over assets on 10th December, 1889, £1,464; living expenses, £190; expected loss on realising estate, £1,195; costs of actions, &c., £60; discount for cash, £8; extra expenses, £30 10s.; and interest on loans, £64.
