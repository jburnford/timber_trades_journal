TRADE REPORTS.
GREENOCK.
We are in the midst of the New Year holidays, and as a consequence business is entirely suspended, the shipyards, saw-mills &c. all being idle till next week, when work will be, at least partially, resumed. It is not known when most of the shipyards will recommence, as the usual notices have been withheld on account, we believe, of a demand on the part of the riveters for a further advance of wages, which the employers are not ready to concede. It is regrettable again to see these indications of labour disputes in this industry, upon which the Clyde timber trade so very largely depends.
There have been no timber arrivals during the week, but one or two cargoes of pitch pine are now due to arrive. We append the statement of timber stocks here for quarter ending 31st December, 1889, in which a comparison is made, as usual, with stocks held at same date in the year preceding. We reserve for your annual special issue detailed comments on this statement, and the Greenock timber trade of 1889. In the meantime we need hardly remind your readers that the stocks at the end of 1888 were very moderate, and a fairer comparison would therefore be made with earlier years. As it is, however, the figures generally should be quite satisfactory to those interested. In a number of items there is a reduction, and only in pitch pine, teakwood, and oak do the figures show a large increase. With regard to the two former the prospects are quite good and the stocks not at all excessive considering the requirements and the large proportions of those woods shown to be in consumers' hands. Oak is mostly in first hands, and as the large imports of oak scantlings to Glasgow has greatly curtailed the outlets for log timber we would not so confidently predict a happy future. At the same time parcels of superior quality will always command a full price from the railway companies, who are the principal consumers.

GLASGOW.
Business has come to a pause here for a few days, being the New Year holiday season, but most of the public works, shipyards, &c., will have resumed by the beginning of next week; the interval is utilised generally by timber merchants for stocktaking, and when trade again starts with the position as to stocks ascertained, transactions are likely to go forward more freely, especially as trade is brisk and prospective requirements large. Subjoined is a statement of the Glasgow, Greenock, and Port Glasgow stocks, which in general exhibit an ample supply.
More than half of the teak shown as in stock is, however, in consumers' hands, also about one-third of the pitch pine. A large proportion of the Quebec timber is also held by consumers (in particular fully one-third of the waney boardwood and deckwood).

The arrivals of the past week are of small amount, not comprising any full cargo; there have been some miscellaneous parcels per steamships from the States, including several lots of walnut, oak, and whitewood boards, imports of which have been on the increase of late.

The only arrivals during the past week have been a cargo of staves per Agathe (s), from Memel, and two lots of staves from Baltimore and New York respectively, the former of which was shipped per Mareca (s). This steamer had also 81 logs wood. The holidays have brought deliveries from the various yards during the past week almost to a standstill; so there is really nothing to report. Some of the mills closed on Saturday, the 28th Dec., for a week.
