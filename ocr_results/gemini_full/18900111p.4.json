Mitchell, fishcurer, Fraserburgh.\nThe cooperage is situated in the fishcuring yard, and adjoined a long range of wooden houses, offices, oil stores, &c.\nMost of the attention was centred on preventing the fire spreading to these buildings, and, with the aid of the coastguard and drill instructors from Fort Charlotte, this was accomplished.\nIn spite of all efforts the cooperage, a wooden erection, was burned to the ground with all its contents.\nThese included 200 boxes of cutch, 20,000 feet of barrel staves, 200 rousing tubs, coopers' tools, and a large quantity of other fishcuring plant.\nThe loss is estimated at £1,000, and is covered by insurance.\nNothing is known as to the origin of the fire.\n\nWILLIAM WATSON,\nWOOD MERCHANT,\nSaw-mills—SHETTLESTON,\nNear GLASGOW.\nA large and varied stock of home-grown timber in the round and converted to all sizes.\n\nROBERT SIMPSON & CO.\nJOHNSTONE SAW-MILLS,\nJOHNSTONE.\nHOME AND FOREIGN TIMBER MERCHANTS.\nStock of all kinds of home-grown Timber, seasoned Spokes and Naves always on hand; also Baltic and American Timber.\n— Packing-case Makers. —\n\nTenth Edition, price 4d., post free.\nTimber Merchant's Companion.\nShowing price per foot run By CHARLES GANE.\nper Petersburg Standard, &c.\nWILLIAM RIDER & SON, 14, Bartholomew Close, EC.\n\nJANUARY 11, 1890.\nBUCKIE.\nALBERT QUAY.\nLarge Stock of Manufactured Wood Goods.\nTO PLANTERS,\nFOREST TREES,\nWe beg to draw the attention of intending Planters and others who intend Planting this Season to our immense Stock of\nSEEDLING AND TRANSPLANTED FOREST TREES.\nFor Hardiness, Health, and Suitability for any Situation they are not to be surpassed.\nBuyers will find it to their advantage to ask for our Samples and Special Quotations before buying elsewhere.\n\nDICKSONS & CO.,\nNURSERYMEN,\n1, WATERLOO PLACE, EDINBURGH.\n\nJOHN BAIRD & CO.,\nTimber Merchants & Saw-millers,\nSpringfield Saw-mills,\nGRAHAMSTONE, FALKIRK.\n\nJAMES POTTER & CO.,\nTIMBER MERCHANTS,\nGrahamstone Saw-mills,\nFALKIRK.\nESTABLISHED 1861.\n\nJ.
