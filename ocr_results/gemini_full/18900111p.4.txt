JANUARY 11, 1890.
COOPERAGE DESTROYED BY FIRE.—Late on Wednesday night fire broke out in the cooperage at Northness, Lerwick, belonging to Mr. Jas. Mitchell, fishcurer, Fraserburgh.
The cooperage is situated in the fishcuring yard, and adjoined a long range of wooden houses, offices, oil stores, &c.
Most of the attention was centred on preventing the fire spreading to these buildings, and, with the aid of the coastguard and drill instructors from Fort Charlotte, this was accomplished.
In spite of all efforts the cooperage, a wooden erection, was burned to the ground with all its contents.
These included 200 boxes of cutch, 20,000 feet of barrel staves, 200 rousing tubs, coopers' tools, and a large quantity of other fishcuring plant.
The loss is estimated at £1,000, and is covered by insurance.
Nothing is known as to the origin of the fire.
