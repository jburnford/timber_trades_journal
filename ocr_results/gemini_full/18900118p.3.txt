tion, even were their direct aims merely confined to the adjustment of general trade terms and discussion of freight and such-like matters, might have a very beneficial influence even on matters of prices, and afford direct opportunities for discussion and interchange of views on the current condition of trade and prices.
The port has been almost overrun by representatives of shippers from the south during the past week or two, but, so far as we can glean, the amount of business actually done has been exceedingly limited, the desire to enter into contracts this year being in very marked contrast with last, when, by this time, a very large volume of wood had been contracted for. The freight market is still practically unopened, importers preferring to wait in hopes of securing easier terms than present quotations. We hear of one vessel being fixed Archangel to Firth of Forth at 50s., but this rate is not likely to be repeated at least for some time.
There have been no public sales this week, which was a source of disappointment to many of the fixed attendants at this popular market. Next week they are, however, resumed, when Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. take up Tuesday with their usual new year's sale, and their catalogue being an unusually attractive one, an important gathering of the trade may be anticipated, and the course of business there will be watched with considerable interest as a guide to the feeling of the trade.

COOPERS' PROTECTIVE SOCIETY.
FORMATION OF A BRANCH AT PETERHEAD.
A BRANCH of the North-East of Scotland Journeymen Coopers' Protective Society was formed at Peterhead on Tuesday evening, the meeting for the purpose, which was held in the U.P. Hall in Thistle Street, being attended by about a hundred coopers. Mr. Mackintosh, delegate from Montrose; Mr. Robertson, secretary of the Aberdeen Branch; Mr. Mundie, Fraserburgh; and Mr. Johnston, of the Aberdeen Trades Union, addressed the meeting on the benefits of combination among the objects of the society. Mr. Johnston, who presided, said they did not come there as agitators to seek to force anything down the throats of the coopers, but to try and convince them that it was not only better for themselves to have a union, but that it was better for the curers also, because if every man was put on an equal footing no employer could undersell his neighbour through cheap labour. He had heard the coopers were working for anything they could get. No man in trade ought to be in that position, and it was only by combination that they could improve their position.
Mr. Mackintosh said the cooper trade was reduced to a very low ebb. In Montrose he knew labourers were getting 20s. a week, while coopers were earning 17s. 5d., out of which they had their tools to keep up, leaving about 16s. 5d. on which to maintain their families. Other tradesmen had from 25s. to 32s. a week, and coopers, who worked as hard as any men, ought to have the same wages. Every other trade was forming a union, and
