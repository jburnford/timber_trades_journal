course, timber freights are very much ruled by the events of the grain and other markets.
A public sale was held on Tuesday by Park, Dobson, & Co., at which there was a fairly large attendance ; there was a good representation of country buyers. The broker on this occasion was Mr. N. R. Calder. The proceedings were commenced with sawn goods, for the most of the varieties of which there was considerable competition, and some good lines changed hands, but, as will be noted from the price list following, there was no change of values. The waney pine timber lately imported was then offered, and for this there seemed to be a number of buyers, the competition for some of the lots being spirited. The top price reached was 3s. 4d., for the heavier wood. Hardwoods did not appear to be in great demand ; buyers were quickly filled up. Altogether the result of the sale was fairly satisfactory.
The following are some of the prices, viz. :—
s. d. s. d.
Waney pine timber (wide) 2 10½ to 3 4
„ „ „ (smaller) 2 6 to 2 8
Square yellow pine 2 5½
