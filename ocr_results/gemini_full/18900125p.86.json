[JANUARY 25, 1890.\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nASHFOLD & GIBBS, builders, Perham Road, West Kensington.—This failure occurred in June last, the bankrupts trading as W. H. Ashfold & Co., and they applied on Wednesday for their discharge. The liabilities expected to rank were returned at £5,107 17s. 10d., and proofs have been made for £3 660 9s. 1d. The assets were returned at £7,948 14s., of which an estimated surplus from security, and the amount actually realised is stated to be £58 4s. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupts began business in partnership in May, 1887, with a joint capital of about £400. The business, with the exception of some small contracts, entirely i.e., the bankrupts took land under building agreements from freeholders, and agreed to build thereon, obtaining advances from the freeholders, and being entitled to take up the leases upon the completion of their contracts. They had built houses in Barton Road and Comeragh Road, West Kensington, under a building agreement dated 25th May, 1888, and the value put upon those houses was £18,400, subject to charges of £12,270 ; but it appeared that there would be no surplus coming to the estate therefrom. The bankrupts attributed their failure to insufficiency of capital and inability to realise their houses. Mr. Aldridge appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Macaskie for the bankrupts. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupts had traded after knowing themselves to be insolvent, and that they had brought on their bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation. Upon the latter ground Mr. Registrar Giffard ordered the discharge to be suspended for fifteen months.\nBUNSILL, C. J., builder and contractor, West Hampstead, N.W.—The debtor has filed his petition, and a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Giffard. The liabilities are estimated at about £29,500, of which £4,500 are unsecured and £25,000 secured. The assets are stated to comprise stock and plant of the value of about £300, in addition to moneys due under contracts, and equities of redemption in mortgaged property.\nCROMACK, JOHN, late deal furniture maker, 6, Hayes Street, Meanwood Road, Leeds, and late of Oatlands Mills, Meanwood Road, Leeds.—The statement of affairs in this case shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £345 14s. 1d., and assets consisting of cash in hand £11 16s. 10d., furniture £14 4s. 9d., book debts, bad, £11 8s., estimated to produce 7s. 6d., total £26 9s. 1d., less preferential claims payable in full, which leaves £22 5s. 6d., and shows a deficiency of £327 12s. 2d. The following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nBlood F. & Co., Birmingham ... ... 14 7 8\nCuthbert Robert, Leeds ... ... ... 47 6 0\nCromack W. H., Bradford ... ... 55 0 0\nHudson & Co., Leeds ... ... ... 108 6 0\nIliffe Yerke G., Birmingham ... ... 10 16 6\nJackson W. H., Leeds ... ... ... 24 0 0\nSempham & Son, Leeds ... ... ... 26 10 6\nStephenson, Scarborough ... ... ... 39 10 8\nDEWELL, WILLIAM, builder, of No. 1, Florence Road, Bromley, Kent.—Particulars in this matter have just been filed. The statement of affairs filed discloses gross liabilities £3,211 8s. 8d., creditors unsecured £2,704 18s. 6d., estimated to rank against the estate for dividend £2,795 1s. 6d., fully secured £496 3s. 7d., book debts £13 12s. 1d., stock £10 1s. 6d., amounting together to £2,436 9s. 6d., from which the sum of £10 1s. 6d., for preferential creditors has to be deducted. The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition. The debtor commenced business in 1888 with a capital of £50 borrowed money. Previous to that time he was a journeyman builder. With the exception of a sum of £98 19s for money lent the whole of his unsecured liabilities were contracted in building.\n\nJANUARY 25, 1890.\n5s. in the pound. The only books kept were small pocket books of receipts and payments. The debts are consolidated.\nHENSON, H., travelling in the timber trade, 55, Oldfield Road, Stoke Newington, N.E.—The receiving order was made on December 6th upon the petition of Messrs. Messer & Co., timber merchants, London and Reading, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday before Mr. Brougham, Assistant Receiver. The failure was described in the proceedings as a private one, but he states that he has been engaged in building either for others or on his own account. He is at present out of business, but has for many years been connected with various firms in the timber trade.\nHis liabilities amount to about £1,000. He attributes his insolvency to his having backed bills, amounting in all to about £800, for a friend. There was no proposal. The Official Receiver will continue to act as trustee of the bankruptcy.\nMAYNARD, EDWARD, of 1, Charlotte Villas, Brockley, builder.—The adjourned public examination of this bankrupt has just been held, before Mr. Registrar Taylor. The gross liabilities were returned at £3,055 0s. 6d. ; net available assets £246 10s. 9d. The bankruptcy commenced business in 1884 with a capital of £95. The debtor attributes his failure to his inability to realise his property arising from want of capital. No further questions were put, and the debtor was allowed to pass.\nMINEARD, HARRY, builder, Barton Road, W.—The bankrupt filed his petition in October last, and he applied on Tuesday for an order of discharge. The liabilities expected to rank amounted to £2,156, and the assets had realised £333 18s. 2d. It appeared that the bankrupt began business as a builder at South Kensington in April, 1888, with a capital of £200, and in April, 1889, he called a meeting of his creditors, at which it was arranged that he should have six months’ extension of time to enable him to realise certain houses he had built at Earl’s Court. The failure was attributed by the bankrupt to his inability to dispose of those houses and to loss arising from them. Mr. Howell represented the Official Receiver, but it was not alleged that the bankrupt had committed any statutory offence, and Mr Brougham granted him his immediate discharge.\nPEEKE, AMOS, builder, Torquay.—At the Exeter Bankruptcy Court, last week, before his Honour Judge Edge, Mr. C. T. J. Andrew made an application for the discharge of this bankrupt. The Official Receiver (Mr. T. Andrew) reported the payment of a final dividend of 3d. in the pound, which would probably be increased by 1d. Discharge granted, but suspended for two months, the debtor having failed to keep books of account.\nRICHARD, G. T. (the younger), Ashley Road, Bristol.—At the Bristol Bankruptcy Court on Friday week, before his Honour Judge Metcalfe, Q.C., this case came up for public examination. Mr. King appeared for debtor. Mr. Gold (a creditor) complained that the debtor had ordered some goods, and on the morning he promised to pay the bill he (Mr. Goldman) received the bankruptcy papers. The public examination was concluded.\nROSSITER, THOMAS, sawdust contractor, Walworth, S.E.—The first meeting in this case was held on Tuesday before Mr. Lamb, acting for the Official Receiver. Liabilities £386 6s. 6d., of which £289 10s. are unsecured, and assets 2s. 11d. The creditors appeared to include :—\n£ s. d.\nBartrum & Co, Belvedere Road, S.E. ... 36 17 4\nJob Albert, Cambria Road, Camberwell ... 17 12 0\nMartin & Son, Lewisham... ... ... ... 33 14 0\nStafford (Trustee of), 61, Cheapside ... 14 10 0\nTaylor A. C., 385, Walworth Road, S.E. 61 10 0\nThe debtor was questioned respecting the sale of his business in October last, and stated that he received a little over £200 in cash, which he paid away to certain of the creditors. It was not true that he had on a previous occasion refused an offer of £500 for the business. The purchaser had taken up a bill of sale on the effects, so that the price amounted to nearly £300. The creditors expressed their dissatisfaction and the hope that the facts would be fully investigated. In the absence of any resolution, the matter remained in the hands of the Official Receiver.\nTHORNTON, HARRY, trading as the Stonebridge Saw Mills Co., 48, Ippleden Road, and Seven Sisters Road, late of Stonebridge Road, Tottenham, saw-mill proprietor.—The first meeting of the creditors herein was held at 28 and 29, St. Swithin’s Lane, E.C., on Wednesday morning, before Mr. Allen H. Stonenam.",
