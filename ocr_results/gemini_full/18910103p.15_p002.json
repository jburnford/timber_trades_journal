The statement of affairs showed unsecured debts £3,573 16s. 10d., and debts fully secured £28,867, with assets nil. The debtor attributed his failure to his inability to let or sell the various properties in which he was interested, and to the action of the mortgagees in foreclosing thereon. The principal trade creditors were Messrs. Norton & Sons, Wharf Road, for £1,361 13s. 7d. Mr. S. Ward attended on behalf of the debtor, and offered a composition of 2s. in the pound. He said that the circumstances were somewhat peculiar, as the debts were in respect of materials supplied for the purposes of a building which was being erected by the debtor's son under a building agreement. Some difficulty appeared to have been experienced by the son in obtaining credit, and the father came forward and ordered the goods. It was found that the building could not be completed by the son, and an arrangement had been made that any surplus which might arise from the building after payment of the mortgagees should be applied in part payment of the debts which had been contracted in connection with it. Some of the creditors had assented to that arrangement, and consequently did not prove under these proceedings. The creditors who did prove had still the option of coming in under that arrangement, or they might accept the 2s. in the pound now offered. Some discussion ensued as to the debtor's interest in properties built by him, which were valued at the same amount suggested that there was a surplus value in such properties more than sufficient to pay 2s. in the pound. One of the secured creditors expressed his willingness to release his securities on payment of the debtor's estimated value in the value of the property. Ward made a proposal, and the case went into bankruptcy, the Official Receiver acting as trustee under the proceedings.\n\nBOON, JOHN, late timber merchant, 86, High Street, Battersea, late of 2, Abbey Garden Road, S.W.—The first meeting of the creditors under this failure took place on Monday last, at the Street, before the Official Receiver, 34, Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, but as there was not a quorum of creditors present, the matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.\n\nLEAR R. B., Terrace Mews, Hamilton Terrace, N.W.—This case was noticed in our last issue. The first meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday before Mr. Hough, Official Receiver. The accounts disclose a deficiency of £270 14s. 10d., the principal trade creditors being:—\nKing C., 70, Lisson Grove, N.W. ... £ s. d. 9 7 0\nSimpson Messrs., 354, Edgware Road ... 14 10 9\nUnwin W., Carlisle Street, Edgware Road ... 84 0 0\nSECURED.\nUnderwood O., Buckhurst Hill ... 65 0 0\nThe debtor attended and said that he was unable to make any proposal. Two creditors in attendance said they had dealt with him for a great many years, and they sympathised with him in his present unfortunate position. The Official Receiver stated that he would continue to act as trustee, and wind up the estate in the usual course of bankruptcy.\n\nPARKINSON, J. & CO., builders, 9, Weightman Road, Harringay Park, N.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Giffard last week, and upon the application of Mr. A. M. Bradley a receiving order was made under a creditor's petition. Mr. Parkinson subsequently attended, and stated that he and his partners in the business. They had built four houses in Weightman Road, three of which were completed, and the whole were mortgaged. They had also been building in Burgoyne Road, under an agreement with the Freehold and Leasehold Investment Company. Some plant and materials were sold under an execution in June last. The amount of the liabilities was not given.\n\nRICE, M. R., builder, 2, Shepherd's Bush Road, W.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Giffard, on Wednesday, and upon the application of Messrs. Boulton & Sons, & Sandeman, a receiving order was made. The proceedings were upon the petition of Messrs. George Farmiloe & Sons, St. John Street, the act of bankruptcy alleged being the non-compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice. The debtor states that his assets consist of a small quantity of plant and furniture and some books. The amount of the liabilities did not transpire.\n\nWEYMOUTH, HENRY, builder, 44, Lancefield Street, Queen's Park.—The receiving order in this case was made on December 11th, upon the petition of Messrs. Joseph Sandell & Co., of Waterloo Bridge Road (creditors for £69 3s.), and the first meeting under the failure was held on Tuesday, before Mr.Wildy, Official Receiver. The accounts were not filed in sufficient time to enable the Official Receiver to prepare his usual observations, but the chairman now stated that the gross liabilities amounted to £2,133 9s. 3d., of which £452 15s. 10d. were expected to rank, and the assets were estimated at £159 2s. 2d. The debtor commenced business in 1880, with about £300 capital, and built nine houses at Hamilton Gardens, St. John's Wood, at a net profit of £250. He lent this money to a brother, who subsequently died without having repaid the loan, and the debtor, being then without capital, ceased building, and worked as a journeyman. About eighteen months ago, having then £70 of his own, and £340 which he had borrowed, he resumed building, but the operations were not altogether successful, and £250 of the borrowed money is still outstanding. He recently called a private meeting of creditors, and, with the assistance of his friends, offered a composition of 5s. in the pound, but the terms were not accepted, and the present proceedings were instituted. The\n\nTeak Timber and Rock Elm, first-class Yellow and Waney Pine Timber, and every description of Shipbuilding Wood.—Hoar & Brown.\n\nJANUARY 3, 1891.\n\nfailure was attributed to the theft of materials, interest upon money, and to want of capital. In reply to the chairman, the debtor said he wished to make an offer, but was not then in a position to state its terms. The Chairman said it was still open to the debtor to apply for the appointment of a new first meeting for the consideration of an offer, but the proceedings would come under the new Act, the provisions of which were much more stringent than the old Act. The case was left to be wound up in bankruptcy, and the Official trustee, will wind up the estate.\n\nWILLIAMS, R., & S., timber merchants, &c., Shirehall, Hereford.—At a sitting held specially for the hearing of cases under the Bankruptcy Act, and held at the Shirehall, Hereford, on the 19th ult., before Honour Judge Melville, the debtors attended and underwent a searching examination, which were conducted by the Official Receiver, Mr. M. J. G. Scobie. Mr. J. M. Jennings (Messrs. Jennings & Son, timber merchants, Cardiff) was present; Mr. J. H. Jacob (representing the trustees of the Birmingham District Bank) and other creditors were present; while Mr. Corner, solicitor (Messrs. Corner & Corner) appeared on behalf of the debtors. The statement shows that the liabilities are estimated at £38,878 16s. 9d., leaving a deficiency of £38,832 2s. 3d. The debtors attribute the failure to \"a series of losses extending over a period of about ten years, bad trade generally, and a loss of £27,000, by the failure of our brother, William Williams, of Hay, to us.\"\nMr. James Williams, one of the partners in the firm, said they commenced business at Hay about ten years ago. The business was carried on previous to that by their father, Robert Williams. They had been interested in the business all their lives. Their father died he (James) and his brother were partners.\nThe Official Receiver.—And share alike?—Th time my brother took one-third, and I took two-thirds.\nHow much capital had you in the business?—I believe it was £1,400.\nContinuing, the debtor said that after their affairs were wound up they had £1,400, and the respective amounts due to them were paid.\nWere those interests paid?—No. All of them were not paid yet. There were three brothers.\nIs your mother dead?—Yes.\nAnd the money has been paid?—The money was not due until twelve months after the death we gave a mortgage for the amount due on the property.\nWho gave the mortgage?—My brother and myself.\nI gave them under the style of \"R. Williams & Son,\" but we assigned personally.\nWas the £4,500 a mortgage at that time?—Yes, about that time.\nRobert Williams appears to have shown him owing you £12,000.\nHave you taken proceedings?—Yes.\nWhat was the result of the proceedings?—That he paid £1,000 a year.\nWhat shares were you to have in the works.\nWhat has become of the amount due to Mr. T. W. Evans?—We paid him.\nWe owed that amount.\nNow we will go to the business at Hay; how long have you been in business there?—About three years—from 1887.\nWe had it from our brother, Robert Williams & Son. We had guaranteed him before, and at the time he took the business he owed us a balance of something like £12,000. The amount due to us varied from about the year 1882. We received £1,000 each year on account.\nWere there any books kept?—Yes.\nWere there recommended to you?—No.\nDid you and your brother ever come to a settlement of accounts?—Yes. We agreed upon a certain sum which we were to take over the business.\nWhat about the liabilities and assets?—When we took it over we found there were a number of liabilities which were not in the calculation. There were also debts owing which were not.",
