The pulpit is the work of Mr. D. Beveridge, sculptor, Perth. The body is of Sicilian marble, is Gothic in design, and octagonal in form. It is supported by eight columns of coloured marble, while the lower base is formed of polished Peterhead granite. The front panel bears a figure in relief representing the Saviour delivering the Sermon on the Mount, and is from the chisel of Mr. Stevenson, Edinburgh.\n\nANNUAL RE-UNION OF THE EMPLOYES AND FRIENDS OF LOVE, STEWART, & CO., AT BO'NESS.\nThis annual event took place in the Masonic Hall, Bo'ness, on Friday last. There were about 200 present. The chair was occupied by Mr. Robert Love, and on the platform, amongst others, were Rev. W. Dundas, Rev. J. Hunter, Messrs. John Balfour, G. C. Stewart, Eadie, McNair, R. Murray, Gladstone, J. Tweedie, Penman Hogg, Wright, Andrew, Easson, Dott, &c.\nAfter tea the chairman, Mr. R. Love, made some suitable remarks, in the course of which he referred to the connection between employers and employes. He had always made it his aim to secure that the best relations should exist in the whole of the firm's establishment, and he felt sure that in this he had been successful. (Applause.) The interests of master and servant were one and the same and could not be divided. What was good for the one was good for the other, and what was bad for the one could not by any possibility be good for the other. He looked back on the past year, and they must all look back, with much gratitude. There had been constant employment all through, and amidst all their activity and bustle no accident had taken place. He thought there was nothing in the present prospects to mar the hope that we had entered on another year of activity in the pitwood trade, and, concluding, he hoped that they would all thoroughly enjoy themselves to-night, and that he might rely on their assistance in making to each other the evening as pleasant as it was possible to do.\nA programme of vocal and instrumental music was gone through, interspersed with readings by Mr. Harrower, of Glasgow, which elicited much applause, and, after a vote of thanks to the chairman, proposed in felicitous terms by Rev. W. Dundas, the meeting was appropriately brought to a close by an assembly which was taken part in by a large number of the company.\n\nDUNDEE INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTURE, SCIENCE, AND ART.—The second ordinary meeting of the institute for the session will be held in the hall of Young Men's Christian Association, on Thursday evening, the 15th instant, at eight o'clock, when a lecture will be delivered on \"Some Architectural and other Notes on Portugal and Spain,\" by Campbell Douglas, Esq., F.R.I.B.A., Glasgow.
