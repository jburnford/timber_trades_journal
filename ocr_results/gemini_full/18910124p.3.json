Tuesday 10th\nGLASGOW Lamb & Crawford Wednesday 11th\n\nDUNDEE.—Three schemes are now before the Dundee Harbour Trustees for providing increased jetty and shed accommodation at the harbour.\nAt a recent meeting of the local Chamber of Commerce it was generally agreed that there was no necessity for further jetty extension, and that all that was required was more shed accommodation, which could be provided on the ground at present occupied by Messrs. Bell & Sime, timber merchants.\n\nJANUARY 24, 1891.\nwhich took place here on the 15th inst., at Glasgow, Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co., brokers:—\nThe transactions publicly are noted below, and it was some further business at the same bargain.\nThe present condition of the stocks of the various qualities of wood, excepting 4ths, which are reduced in amount to last year's, lead to the firm as to prices, and the lots of 1st quality deals went off well, with stocks in ordinary yards, and would probably been very acceptable.\nThe lots were disposed of publicly.\n4ths are looked for, owing to the scarcity of pine deals in this market.\n1st quality red 15 ft. 11x3 3rd quality pine deals, 11d. per cubic foot.\nThe attendance was good, but the buying was restricted to immediate requirements, and a small portion of the goods are left in hanging hands.\nAUCTION SALE.\nYellow pine deals—\nInches Price per C. ft.\n11x3 1s. to 1s. 1d.\nYellow pine deals—\n12/21x3 11 1/2d. & 11 3/4d.\n11/25x3 10d.\n11x3 10d.\n7/10x3 10d.\n1st spruce deals—\n6/10x3 9 1/2d. to 11 1/2d.\n2nd spruce deals—\n8x4 9d.\n6x4 8 1/2d.\n6x4 8d.\n2nd & 3rd spruce deals—\n9x3 9 1/4d. & 9 1/2d.\n7x3 8 1/4d. & 8 1/2d.\n3rd spruce deals—\n11x3 10d.\n9x3 8d.\nUnsorted spruce deals—\n6x3 9d.\nIt has just been received that the vessel Eliza, a vessel which has been expected for some little time past, is now coming up river.\nHer cargo consigned, to Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co., is reported to consist of sizeable logs (Honduras mahogany), and from the recent indications of this market a strong demand exists for wood of this description.\nThe railway strike is still telling adversely on trade, retarding delivery of goods, though the normal condition of things is gradually being brought about; the N.B. line, however, according to latest reports, continues in a disorganised state.\nAt the public sale of timber held at Greenock on 22nd inst, by Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells, only a moderate amount of business was done.\nThe weather was unfavourable.\nA note of transactions is appended:—\nQuebec waney boardwood—\nPer ft. cube.\n15/17in. avg. sq., poor quality 1s. 1d.\n18 in. 1s. 2d.\n20 in. 1s. 3d.\nQuebec 1st yellow pine—\n18 in. 1s. 2d.\n(2s. 2d. was offered, but declined, for a parcel 15/17in. avg. waney boardwood.)\nQuebec 4th pine ends—\n4/10 ft. 6/11x3 8 1/2d.\nQuebec 3rd spruce deals—\n12 ft. 8x3 8 1/2d.\nQuebec 4th spruce deals—\n9/14 ft. 7/11x3 8d.\n\nLEITH.\nThere are no arrivals of wood-laden tonnage to report this week, and the only transactions are some staves by the New York and Hamburg steamers and a few oak logs from Copenhagen.\nWith the exception of the difficulty of getting country orders executed owing to the derangement of traffic on the N.B. railway no can trade is moving away very briskly as can be expected at this season of the year.\nThe weather has been so severe this year.\n\nThe Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\nIMPORTS.\nBORROWSTOUNNESS.\nJan. 13 Lindholmen (s)—Gothenburg—59,274 pcs. pitwood—J.
