whole much less severe than further south, and the interruption to outside work has not been prolonged.
If a return of ordinary railway facilities could only be got, deliveries of wood would be greatly stimulated, and in the absence of fresh imports, stocks would be proportionately reduced.
Next week will see a resumption of public sales, of which several are announced, and it is to be sincerely hoped that the railway strike will have finally collapsed ere then.

DUNDEE.—Three schemes are now before the Dundee Harbour Trustees for providing increased jetty and shed accommodation at the harbour.
At a recent meeting of the local Chamber of Commerce it was generally agreed that there was no necessity for further jetty extension, and that all that was required was more shed accommodation, which could be provided on the ground at present occupied by Messrs. Bell & Sime, timber merchants.

which took place here on the 15th inst., at Glasgow, Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co., brokers:—
The transactions publicly are noted below, and it was some further business at the same bargain.
The present condition of the stocks of the various qualities of wood, excepting 4ths, which are reduced in amount to last year's, lead to the firm as to prices, and the lots of 1st quality deals went off well, with stocks in ordinary yards, and would probably been very acceptable.
The lots were disposed of publicly.
4ths are looked for, owing to the scarcity of pine deals in this market.
1st quality red 15 ft. 11x3 3rd quality pine deals, 11d. per cubic foot.
The attendance was good, but the buying was restricted to immediate requirements, and a small portion of the goods are left in hanging hands.

It has just been received that the vessel Eliza, a vessel which has been expected for some little time past, is now coming up river.
Her cargo consigned, to Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co., is reported to consist of sizeable logs (Honduras mahogany), and from the recent indications of this market a strong demand exists for wood of this description.
The railway strike is still telling adversely on trade, retarding delivery of goods, though the normal condition of things is gradually being brought about; the N.B. line, however, according to latest reports, continues in a disorganised state.
At the public sale of timber held at Greenock on 22nd inst, by Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells, only a moderate amount of business was done.
The weather was unfavourable.

LEITH.
There are no arrivals of wood-laden tonnage to report this week, and the only transactions are some staves by the New York and Hamburg steamers and a few oak logs from Copenhagen.
With the exception of the difficulty of getting country orders executed owing to the derangement of traffic on the N.B. railway no can trade is moving away very briskly as can be expected at this season of the year.
The weather has been so severe this year.
