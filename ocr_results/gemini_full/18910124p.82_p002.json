Mr. John G. Gibson, Assistant Official Receiver, said he did not purpose reopening the examination, and had no objection to its closing. Having made the usual declaration of full disclosure, and signed the notes of the previous examinations, the learned Registrar directed the public examination of both bankrupts to be closed.\nBROWN, ELIZA, wood and timber dealer and turner, Sandy Lane, Calne.—This bankrupt attended at the Swindon Bankruptcy Court last week before Mr. Registrar Kinnear, for public examination, having been adjourned to enable her to give further accounts. Nothing of an important nature transpired, and the Official Receiver (Mr. H. J. Tombs) offering no objection, the bankrupt was allowed to pass her public examination.\nCHIRM, J. R. & CO. (Joseph Chirm), timber and slate merchant, and a solicitor, 91, Hagley Road, Bridge Street, Worcester Wharf, and 42, Temple Street, Birmingham. In this deed of arrangement case the principal creditors are :—\n£ s. d.\nAdams, Thomas, & Co., Ltd., Birmingham ... 69 9 9\nAlexanders & Co., Cardiff .. ... ... 576 5 4\nBatchelor T.

A. Willoughby) for adjourned examination. Mr. A. Mackintosh (Senior Official Receiver) said the examination had been formally adjourned, but he wished to examine the debtor with reference to some evidence which was elicited at a private sitting and also as to the bill of sale. The Registrar said the examination not having been closed, it could proceed. Upon being called, bankrupt failed to answer, and upon the application of the Official Receiver the examination was adjourned till the 29th inst., notice to be given of the intention to reopen the examination. Subsequently bankrupt entered the Court, and was informed of the decision of the Court.\nCROWTHER, CHARLES, plumber and builder, late of 13, Portland Street, Leeds, and now of 6, Woodville Grove, Bagby Fields.—A meeting has been held at the offices of the Leeds Official Receiver. The liabilities were stated to be £600 2s, with an estimated surplus of £130 9s. 11d. No resolutions were passed. The following is a list of the creditors above £10 :—\n£ s. d.\nBrown, Jonas, & Son, Leeds ... ... 22 10 6\nBrown C., West Hartlepool ... ... 27 0 0\nCalvert A.

The liabilities were returned at £976 5s. 5d., with assets which have realised £151 3s. 6d. and yielded a first and final dividend of 1s. 6 1/4d. in the pound. It appeared from the Official Receiver's report (read by Mr. Brougham) that the bankrupt commenced business in 1883 with a capital of £10 in partnership, and in August, 1888, he paid out the partner with £100, borrowed for the purpose. The failure was attributed to a loss of £300 upon a Government contract, also to loss by a fire, to expenses of alterations, repairs and improvements, and other causes. The offences alleged were imperfect bookkeeping, trading with knowledge of insolvency, and the giving of an undue preference to creditors. His Honour dealt with the case by suspending the discharge for six months.\nKNIGHT, THOMAS, late builder, Crelake, Tavistock, now traveller, 37, Montague Road, Dalston, London. In this deed of arrangement case the principal creditors are :—\n£ s. d.\nBayly R. & R., Plymouth .. ... ... 52 0 0\nEde & Son, Plymouth ... ... ... 55 0 0\nFox, Elliott, & Co., Plymouth ... ... 192 0 0\nJewson Bros, Plymouth ... ... ... 10 0 0\nKYNOCK, G., builder, 59, High Street, Clapham, S.W.—This heavy failure has been previously reported (May 3rd and 17th, 1890), and the sitting for the adjourned public examination was appointed to be held at the Wandsworth Bankruptcy Court on the 15th. The Registrar (Mr. W. A. Willoughby) reported that he had received a letter from the bankrupt\n\nstating he was suffering from inflammation of the lungs, and applying for an adjournment. Mr. A. Mackintosh, senior Official Receiver, offered no opposition, and the application was granted, the adjournment being till the 29th inst.\nNORRIS, J. W., builder, 91, Caistro Park Road, West Ham, E.—This bankrupt failed in August last, and he applied to Mr. Registrar Giffard, on the 16th inst., for his order of discharge. The unsecured liabilities were returned at £412 15s. 4d., and the assets were estimated at £483 18s. 4d., but by the trustee at only £50. It appeared from the report of the Official Receiver that the bankrupt was formerly a carpenter and builder, and about six years ago he built ten houses on a plot of land at Leytonstone, under an agreement with his father. He also, in the years 1887, 1888, and 1889, built houses at Leyton in respect to the materials for which the present indebtedness was incurred. The bankrupt attributed his failure to his inability to recover from his father his share of the sale proceeds at Leytonstone, and to other causes. It appeared that he had kept no books of account whatever, and his Honour, upon that ground, suspended the bankrupt's discharge for two years.\nREES J. & F., builders, Aberavon.—At the Bankruptcy Court last week, before Mr. Registrar Charles, the debtors explained that their present position was the result of loss on contracts, depreciation of the value of stock, bad debts, &c. The examination was adjourned. A list of the creditors in this case was given in our last issue.\nRICE, M. R., builder and contractor, 13, Shepherd's Bush Road, W.—A receiving order was recently made in this case on a creditor's petition, and the accounts now furnished show unsecured debts £367 10s., and preferential claims £40 8s. 10d., with assets which are valued at £41 1s. 10d. The debtor states that he commenced business as a builder in 1880, at the above address, and he attributes his insolvency to loss on a building contract, and his expenses having exceeded his profits. The creditors include :—\n£ s. d.\nFarminoe George & Sons, St. John Street, W.C. ... ... ... ... 88 8 9\nJervis W. N., Hammersmith ... ... 30 16 3\nFroy W. & Son, Uxbridge Road, W. ... 68 10 8\nMenneer G., Shepherd's Bush Road ... 45 0 0\nPutney S., Baltic Wharf, Paddington ... 31 5 10\nWilliams, Son, & Wallington, Shepherd's Bush ... ... ... ... 30 0 0\nThe first meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday, and the matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver as trustee.\nSMITH, RALPH.—In our report of this case last week we stated Messrs. A. J. Philcox & Co. to be creditors to the extent of £51. We are informed that the debt is fully secured to the firm.\nSTONE, WM. JOHN, builder, Balsall Heath.—This failure has been previously reported, and bankrupt again surrendered at the Wandsworth Bankruptcy Court on the 15th for his adjourned examination, having been ordered to furnish a goods and cash account. He was supported by Mr. Wotton, solicitor, and Mr. A. Mackintosh (senior Official Receiver) was also present. The accounts ordered had been filed, and bankrupt was examined at length thereon. He said he had kept no books, and the account had been made up from the bank-book, invoices, and particulars of advances obtained from the mortgagee. He closed his banking account in June, 1890, and the bank-book showed receipts £2,420, expenditure, £3,419. The Official Receiver said the cash account up to the date of closing the banking account showed receipts £5,682, and the expenditure £6,147. Bankrupt could give no explanation of his ability to make this excess over expenditure. He had not paid all his receipts into the bank, and he would account for the discrepancy between certain items in the cash account and the bank account. The amounts of the mortgages he had inserted in the statement did not represent the amounts he had received. He had signed the mortgages for the full amount, but had only received a part. He had all advances from Mr. Goole, and had received from him particulars of the advances he received. He was now in the employ of the mortgagee. After a brief examination by Mr. Wotton, the examination was adjourned.\nWALL, GEORGE, builder and contractor, carrying on business at Kentish Town, under the style of Wall Brothers.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Linklater on Wednesday. An application for an order of discharge was opposed by the London School Board.",
