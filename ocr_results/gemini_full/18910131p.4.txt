LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
NON-DELIVERY OF A VESSEL.
STORM v. GEDDIE.
At the Court of Session, Lord Stormonth Darling has closed the record in an action by John Storm, 59, Belgrave Street, Glasgow, against James Geddie, shipbuilder, Buckiemouth, for payment of £158. In October, 1889, the pursuer entered into negotiations with the defender, with a view to the construction of a vessel suitable for the Baltic trade, and it was part of the contract that the vessel should be delivered complete by July, 1890, but this the defender failed to do, and in consequence the pursuer says he has suffered loss to the amount concluded for. In particular he has lost the freight which the vessel would have earned during the last two months of the season in the Baltic trade, amounting at least to £120. Further, he has had to pay wages and other expenses amounting to £38. The defender replies that no time was fixed for the completion of the vessel, and that accounts have been finally adjusted between the parties.
