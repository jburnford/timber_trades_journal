Cooley sold a quantity of oak posts and scantlings, oak spokes, boards, and planking by auction in the Market Place, Boston.\nA CHANCEL screen of carved oak has been placed in Padstow parish church.—carried out the firm—Messrs. Stribley & Son, of Truro, did the work.\nA FIRE broke out on Monday night in the premises occupied by Mr. Porter's timber yard, and on which the remainder stands a boot and shoe warehouse. The fire was happily not of serious extent.\nTHE protracted litigation in the case of the Australia has come to an end, judgment having been entered in the Admiralty Court for the appellant, Mr. W. Watkins. The action was originally brought in the City of London Court by Messrs. Burt, Boulton & Haywood, the owners of the barge Elizabeth, against Mr. W. Watkins, the owner of the steam tug Australia, for damage by collision in the River Thames on December 9th, 1889.\nTRANSFER OF BUSINESS.—The patterns and drawings of the machines made by Messrs. Furness & Co., of Liverpool, have been acquired by Messrs. F. W. Reynolds & Co., Acorn Works, Edward Street, Blackfriars Road, London, S.E., to whom the business of the firm has just been transferred. Mr. Gardner, who for eighteen years has had the practical management of Messrs. Furness & Co.'s works, will give his personal attention to inquiries for the machines hitherto made by that firm.\nCHAIR MANUFACTURERS' BANQUET TO LORD CARRINGTON.—A banquet, given by the Wycombe Chair Manufacturers' Association to celebrate the return home of Lord Carrington, has taken place at the Wellington Room of the Red Lion Hotel, Wycombe. The Mayor (Mr. T. Glenister), who is also chairman of the Association, presided, and he was supported by Lord Carrington, Mr. W. Howland, Secretary; Mr. S. Webb, treasurer; and others. In responding to the toast of his health, his Lordship made an interesting speech, giving graphic sketches of New South Wales, and also expressing the delight of Lady Carrington and himself to find themselves once more at home in Wycombe, and to learn the progress they had made there during their absence, and how thriving the present condition of the town was. Towards the close of the proceedings a handsome silver tea service, suitably inscribed, was presented to Mr. Walter Howland from the Association, in recognition of his valuable services as honorary secretary.\nLOCK-OUT OF PACKING-CASE MAKERS.—A lock-out, in which 1,500 men are involved, has taken place in the firewood-cutting and box and packing-case making trades. Disputes have been going on between Messrs. Duffy, of Bermondsey, and Mr. Louis Duke, of Haggerston, and their employes, they, it is said, having refused to concede the advance in wages made by other firms in January, 1890. The secretary of the National Union of Firewood Cutters, Mill Sawyers, and Box and Packing-case Makers received the following communication from the secretary of the Masters' Association on Saturday last:— \"Dear Sir,—I beg to give you notice that to-day all employes of members of this association will receive a week's notice to leave work. The notice will be strictly enforced only in the event of the employes of Mr. Louis Duke, and Messrs. Duffy not returning to their work on Monday, February 2nd, as usual.—Yours, &c., George Harrup, Secretary.\" On Saturday afternoon the employes of the following firms left work:—Messrs. Duffy, Haggerston; Messrs. Steele, Deptford; Messrs. Bridgeman and Messrs. Lymes, Haggerston; Messrs. Booth, Hoxton; Messrs. West, Cambridge Heath; and Messrs. Duralles, Cambridge Road. The union is about 3,000 strong.\n\nLEGAL INTELLIGENCE.\nA SINGULAR ACT.\nGIBBS & SON v. FITZPATRICK.\nAt the Halifax County Court, on Tuesday before his Honour Judge Cadman, the case of Gibbs & Son v Fitzpatrick was heard. The plaintiffs sued the defendant, who carries on business as a cabinet-maker at the Atlas Cabinet Works, Miles Platting, Manchester, for £6 15s. 8d., moneys alleged to be due as the balance of certain trade transactions. The defendant put in a counter-claim for £24 19s. 4d. It appeared that Messrs. Gibbs & Son had on several occasions received consignments of furniture from the defendant and advanced money upon them. The last consignment consisted of a quantity of veneering, upon which an advance was made. It was found, as alleged by the plaintiffs, that the consignment was not according to previous quality and was unsaleable in the Halifax district. Plaintiffs therefore had them sold in another town at the best prices they would\n\n107\nfetch, but the defendant refused to accept the proceeds of the sale, contending that he fixed the lowest prices at which the goods were to be sold. Mr. George Gibbs denied that the prices were absolutely fixed. It was understood that his firm had a discretionary power. They had to do the best they could. His Honour gave a verdict in favour of Messrs. Gibbs & Son, on both the claim and the counter-claim.\n\nRESULT OF A CRANE ACCIDENT.\nCREASY v. ELLIS.\nThis action came on for hearing on Wednesday last week before Mr. Justice Stephen and a special jury. The plaintiff, a carter in the employ of a contractor at Silverhill, Hastings, sought to recover from defendant, a timber merchant, damages for personal injuries. It appeared that the plaintiff's employer had a contract to cart timber belonging to the defendant. The plaintiff was for unloading a load of timber at defendant's yard when the crane that was being used for the purpose broke and fell upon him, injuring him severely. His case was that the crane was negligently kept in a rotten and improper condition. The defendant denied the allegation, and said the defect in the crane was not patent, but latent, also that the crane was used by the plaintiff for his own convenience; also that he gave plaintiff no order or permission to use it. Eventually the jury gave a verdict in favour of the plaintiff, assessing the damages at £225. Judgment accordingly.\n\nIMPORTS.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
