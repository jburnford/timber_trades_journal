Angus Kennedy, one of the partners of the firm, said he was a joiner on his own account before he went into partnership with Mr. Ingram. He had been in business at 110, Stirling Road, for about ten years. The business was not altogether successful, and he had a private meeting of his creditors, when he agreed to pay 6s. 8d. in the pound, and that arrangement was carried through. He joined Mr. Ingram in July, 1888. The previous composition had been paid by them. He put £180 into the business, and had about £55 worth of stock and tools. The first property that he had in Stirling Road was built was at a cost of £828 9s. 11d. The bankrupts considered the tenements at Mount Florida had been undervalued to the extent of £400, and £50 had been paid for factorages and other services. William George Ingram, on being called, corroborated the evidence given by his partner. He stated that he had put £270 into the business. The debtors were finally allowed to pass.\n\nPROCEEDINGS UNDER SEQUESTRATION.\nSEQUESTRATED.\nBELL WALTER, writer, 81, Cecil Street, Hillhead, and 81, Bath Street, Glasgow. January 31.
