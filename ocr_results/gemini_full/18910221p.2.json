CAMPBELL, Esq., of Kilberry, Argyllshire.\n\nBUSINESS FOR SALE.\nLADYBURN SAW-MILL, PORT-GLASGOW ROAD, GREENOCK.—To LET or for SALE.—The Greenock Harbour Trustees are prepared to LET or SELL LADYBURN SAW-MILL, together with the PLANT and MACHINERY therein, capable of carrying on an extensive trade. Additional Storage Ground can be had adjoining the Mill. The Mill is in close proximity to the James Watt Dock and the Garvel Harbour; and the connections of the Caledonian and Glasgow and South-Western Railways to the James Watt Dock run alongside the Mill.\nFor further particulars apply to Mr. Wilson, General Manager, with whom Offers may be lodged on or before 2nd March, 1891.\nThe Trustees do not bind themselves to accept the highest or any offer.\n\nScotch fir near the same district. Mr. Geo. Halliday, Rothesay, has secured a heavy lot including of hardwoods and mixed firs, and in addition an extensive oak coppice sufficient to produce an excellent supply of bark at Dunmore, in Argyleshire.\n\nHONOUR TO A PERTH CONTRACTOR.—We observe from the Dundee papers that the Work Committee of the Dundee Police Trustees have agreed to accept the offer of Mr. William Philip, Dundee, to do the whole work of the extension of the Cattle Depot for the sum of £3,999, with this proviso, that Mr. John Peebles, Perth, who did the granolithic work of the Cattle Depot, should also do the granolithic work for Mr. Philip. This is a very high testimonial to the excellence of the workmanship of Mr. Peebles.\n\nTRADE REPORTS.\nDUNDEE.\nWe have no new feature of consequence to report on here.\nThere has been no new arrival since our last, and the mills continue to be moderately busy without pressure.\nThe rather serious outbreak of fever in certain quarters of the city is expected to give an impetus to the present agitation for new dwelling-houses with improved sanitary arrangements, and the clearing out of old and notoriously unhealthy houses.\nThe prospects in the building trade are decidedly good, already many plans for tenement dwellings have appeared, and others are being prepared for sanction of the commissioners.\nAt Messrs. Donaldson's sale, at Tayport, on Wednesday last week, a considerable quantity of their varied stock was disposed of at moderate but generally satisfactory prices.\nWe observe Messrs. Bell & Sime advertise a sale for Monday first, when they will offer the usual large and varied assortment.\n\nGLASGOW.\nDeliveries from the storage depots here have been going on at a fair rate, and as there are no imports to speak of being yarded, stocks are getting rapidly reduced.\nThe Yorkhill deliveries of deals, planks, &c., for January were, to a considerable extent, in excess of those for the same time last year, and the current month is also showing a decided increase so far as it has gone.\nPrices reported for deals show values to be well maintained, especially 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pine.\nAt Queen's Dock during the past week or two there have been discharged ex several liners a number of parcels of wood goods, comprising walnut and whitewood logs, planks, and lumber of various kinds.\n\nFEBRUARY 21, 1891.\nFLEMING & BARRY,\nCAMPERDOWN SAW-MILLS, DUNDEE.\nAll dimensions from 22 to 70 ft. long.\n3 to 18 in. diam., always in stock.\nstored at Queen's Dock, but of the goods above referred to the bulk went into consumers' hands ex quay.\nPrices obtainable for walnut continue satisfactory.\nThe recent arrivals, however, have pretty well met present requirements for small-sized logs, but large and medium of prime quality are wanted.\nNo auction sales to report have taken place here since last writing.\nMessrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.'s timber sale at Greenock on 12th inst. referred to more particularly below, gave a favourable indication of the market prices generally remaining firm.\nThere were no pitch pine imports to record during January, as against 5,579 logs in that month of 1890.\nA restricting of importations would of course conduce to a more healthy and sound tone and a needed hardening of prices.\nMessrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co. are to hold a public sale of deals on Wednesday, the 25th inst., at Yorkhill Wharf.\n\nGREENOCK.\nThe extent of passing business is very considerable, especially in shipbuilding woods.\nLarge deliveries continue to be made from the ponds, these finding their way chiefly to shipbuilding yards both on the upper and lower reaches of the river.\nThe rate of recent deliveries will probably not be maintained, but, after allowing for a large falling off, the stocks of square timber will, at the end of the current quarter, show an extremely satisfactory reduction.\nIn addition to local deliveries the steamer Rowena has just loaded a large cargo of timber for Bilbao, consisting mainly of teak and yellow pine deckwood.\nWe have three cargoes of pitch pine presently discharging, viz., the Sirene, from Brunswick, for James Hunter; the Bothnia and the Primus, from Pensacola, both for McDowall & Nielson.\nAt Allison, Cousland, & Co.'s recent auction sale a fair amount of business was done publicly, and, we understand, some large lines were privately done in boardwood after the public proceedings had terminated.\nAmong the chief transactions were the following:—\nFt. avg. Per. c. ft.\n2nd waney pine 1,100 16½d.\n1,300 17½d.\n500 17d.\nSquare boardwood 520 18d.\n600 19d.\n1st square yellow pine 18d. & 21½d.\nCommon yellow pine 800 13½d. & 15d.\nQuebec red pine 800 15d. & 14d.\n700 13½d.\n600 13d.\nElm, small 19d.\nOak 2s. 2½d.\nSawn pitch pine 700 1s. 0½d.\n1st yellow pine deals 12x6 to 10x3 2s.\n1st yellow pine deal ends 16x11x3 2s. 8½d.\n2nd yellow pine deals 1s. 7d. to 1s. 11d.\n14 to 16x10x3 upx3\n3rd yellow pine deals—\n9 to 16x7 & upx3 13½d.\n10 to 16x10 to 18x3 13½d.\n4th yellow pine deals—\n14 to 16x7 & upx3 9½d.\n3rd spruce deals 8½d. & 8¾d.\n4th spruce deals 8d.\nShipbuilding orders are not now so plentiful, but two of our local firms, viz, Scott & Co. and Murdoch & Murray, have booked several steamers of small tonnage during the past week.\n\nLEITH.\nThe only arrivals during the past week are some parcels of oak staves from Fiume, New York, and Libau, also a parcel of American whitewood logs by steamer from New York.\nThere is a continuance of fine dry weather, which is favourable for all outside work, and business, although not very brisk, is fairly steady, an average consumption of wood goods being experienced.\nThere has been no public sale here this week, and there is no change in prices to report, values remaining steady at late quotations.\nOf some special descriptions and sizes there seems likely to be a shortage before the fresh arrivals from the Baltic ports can reach here, but generally speaking stocks will be ample for all probable requirements.\n\nIMPORTS.\nFeb. 10 Queen of the Dart—Laurvig-25,462 props—Kirkwood & Co.\nFeb. 14 Colibri (s)—Gothenburg-1,374 bdls. props—G.
