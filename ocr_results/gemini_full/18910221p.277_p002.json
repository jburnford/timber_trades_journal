L., timber merchant, lately trading with Richard George Guy as George Guy & Co., at London, and Grey, Bevan, & Co., at New Brunswick.—An application was made to Mr. Registrar Giffard, on Thursday, for an order of discharge from the bankruptcy proceedings of the debtor, who failed in March, 1887, and whose proceedings were the following month consolidated with those of his partner, Mr. Guy. Mr. Egerton Grey, Assistant Receiver, attended for his department with the report of the Official Receiver. Mr. Maples (Maples, Teasdale & Co.) appeared for the trustee under the proceedings, and Mr. Herbert Reed (with him Mr. Mellor) appeared for the bankrupt, in support of the application. The report of the Official Receiver set forth that the debtor filed his own petition on the 19th March, 1887, and on the same day a receiving order was also made against Mr. R. G. Guy, the partner. By order of the Court, the two proceedings were consolidated on the 1st April, 1887. The joint statement of affairs showed liabilities £105,229 17s. 3d., expected to rank against assets valued by the firm at £25,423 10s. 1d. Proofs were made by thirty-four creditors for sums amounting in the aggregate to £94,818 19s. 6d., and the trustee had reported that the assets had only realised £1,047 13s. 3d., so that no dividend whatever had been paid to the creditors. The first meeting was held on the 10th June, 1887, when Mr. C. T. Kemp was appointed to the post of trustee, with a committee of inspection. An order of adjudication was made on the 30th March, 1887, and the public examination was concluded on the 2nd November following. The bankrupt's separate estate account showed liabilities £2 and assets £994. Proofs, however, to the amount of £3,139 14s. 4d. were made by five creditors, but £3,075 of that sum is still in dispute, and a dividend of 20s. in the pound has been paid on the balance, the separate assets having already realised £1,930 7s. 1d., and a further sum of £50 being anticipated by the trustee. The bankrupt, who is a retired officer of H.M. navy, states that he entered into partnership with Mr. Richard George Guy in 1878, and they traded together as timber merchants under the style of George Guy & Co., in London, and Guy, Bevan, & Co., in New Brunswick. The bankrupt brought £20,000 into the business as his capital, one-half of which was lent to him by his father. The partners' share of the capital amounted to £30,000. Owing to the mismanagement of the business by himself and his partner, the firm got into difficulties, and on the 21st March, 1882, the bankrupt entered into an agreement with Messrs. Stewart Bros. (who had effected a like arrangement with Mr. G. Guy) to sell to them his interest in the business for £3,000 (of which he only received £1,500), the purchasers agreeing to take over all the assets and liabilities of the firm, with a stipulation that the sale should be kept secret, and that the partners should not be gazetted out of the firm, which was to be carried on under the same style as before, but under the control and direction of the purchasers. After the execution of that agreement, the bankrupt went out to America, and for a short time assisted in the management of the New Brunswick business, but returned to England in March or April, 1883, since which time, he states, he has taken no part whatever in the management of either of the businesses. On the failure of Messrs. Stewart Bros. early in 1887, and the liability of the bankrupt and his partner for the debts incurred by Stewart Bros. in London in the bankrupts' names, they (Bevan & Guy) were compelled to file their petitions, and, by an order of the Court, the proceedings were subsequently consolidated. The bankrupt states that he has all along been under the impression that notwithstanding the agreement with Stewart Brothers above referred to, he nevertheless (jointly with his partner) continued his liability for the debts contracted in the firm's name subsequent to the execution of such agreement, by reason of the secrecy observed with regard to the sale of the business and the failure to gazette the dissolution of the partnership. In effect the bankrupt in allowing his name to be put forward as a member of the firm after he had parted with his interest and control thereof, and permitting liabilities of upwards of £100,000 to be incurred in the firm's name after the said firm had divested itself of all means of meeting such liabilities has been a party to practising a deception on the creditors, and the Official Receiver therefore reported “that in this respect the bankrupt has been guilty of misconduct in relation to his affairs.” It further appeared from the bankrupt's evidence that he was the registered proprietor of £1,000 in stock in the business of Henry Pound & Son. The shares were held by the brokers, Messrs. Birch & Co., as security for payment of the purchase money which they had advanced to the bankrupt, Messrs. Birch & Co. also holding other shares as collateral security. The bankrupt states that learning that Messrs. Stewart Brothers were in difficulties, and fearing that he would be involved in their failure, he executed a voluntary transfer of these shares to Messrs. Birch & Co. a few days prior to the filing of his petition. Further, that, by a verbal agreement between them, Messrs. Birch & Co. would have been entitled to sell the shares on the 31st March, 1887, in the event of his (the bankrupt's) failure to redeem them by that day. Nevertheless, by interfering in the matter, with the evident intention of benefiting one creditor to the possible detriment of the others, the Official Receiver had further to report “that the bankrupt has within three months of the receiving order when unable to pay his debts as they became due given an undue preference to Messrs. Birch & Co.” The report having been read, Mr. Grey stated that the Official Receiver placed very little importance upon the charge of undue preference, as the circumstances in connection with it tended to show that no harm had been sustained by the creditors. The Registrar thought the serious charge in the report was the secret arrangement between the firms Guy, Bevan, & Co. and Stewart Brothers, and that the charge of undue preference was only a technical one. No opposition was preferred, either by creditors or by Messrs. Maples on behalf of the trustee. In making the application, Mr. Reed said in 1877 his client went into business, having no knowledge of business matters; the bankrupt was, unfortunately induced to go into the business of a lumberman. He was introduced to Mr. R. G. Guy, and at the time Mr. Guy had a very large business as a lumberman in Canada and England, and believed himself to be worth some £30,000, or upwards. It was believed at the time that it was an admirable undertaking for Bevan to join, and his father accordingly contributed £20,000, and Bevan became a partner in the business. A special clause was introduced in the articles of partnership, which provided that the decision of Mr. Guy should be binding and conclusive upon all business matters. Before finally deciding to join in the business as a partner, the bankrupt went into it as a trial in order to obtain a knowledge of the business into which he was to enter. That trial, unfortunately, only lasted a few months, and the bankrupt only had a brief experience of the transactions of the firm. He however satisfied himself that the business was one which would produce large sums of money if properly managed, and he got some sort of idea what the operations of the firm were. He found the firm were engaged in timber undertakings in New Brunswick. They acquired right to cut timber in the country, engaged gangs of men in certain seasons of the year to cut the timber, and had it conveyed to the brooks and rivers, so that when the spring came the logs were floated down to the mills, sawn, and consigned to customers. The only risk of the business was that each year's crop\n\nImported Teak Planks, in all thicknesses and widths, are sold by Hoar & Brown, East Wood Wharf, West India Docks, E.

The business was carried on by means of advances from banks. Soon after the bankrupt joined good times and the lumbering trade, and in 1880 and 1881 considerable profits were made. In spite of that, however, the bankrupt could not help seeing that a great portion of the assets of the firm, which existed on paper, and which might under different management have been very valuable, had ceased to be assets available to them. In 1882 he was approached by Messrs. Stewart Bros., with a view of taking over his interest in the business of Guy, Bevan, & Co., in Canada, and gradually wind up the affairs of that business. The Stewarts were supposed to be worth £60,000 or more. The bankrupt accordingly, after looking into matters, found that his nominal interest was only worth £7,000, and from what he had seen, he would be fortunate in realising even that sum, considering his imperfect knowledge of the business.\nThe Registrar: How was it that the £20,000 invested by the bankrupt had been reduced to £7,000?\nMr. Reed explained that the assets consists of logs in a rough state, and it entailed very great risk and expense to reduce them to liquid assets. The bankrupt declined to keep in a business of which he knew so little, and knew that Guy had also determined to retire from it as soon as he could. He did not feel justified in incurring further liabilities, and accordingly entered into an arrangement with Messrs. Stewart, the terms of which provided for a further sum of £10,000 to be advanced by Mr. Bevan, sen., to assist in the liquidation of Guy, Bevan, & Co.'s assets, and for the bankrupt to retire from the business, receiving £3,000 as his share of the interest.\nThe Registrar: But what was to become of the £10,000 advanced by the bankrupt's father?\nMr. Reed replied that the liquidation of the business had been done it was continued by Bevan, sen. Continuing, the learned counsel said that his client had been left in the lurch, and had handed every penny he possessed for the benefit of the creditors. In his opinion the bankrupt was really a victim to misfortune, inasmuch as he had lost £40,000 in the business from first to last he had never had a penny from the business. Taking into consideration all the facts (he contended) come to no other conclusion than that it was a case of extreme misfortune.\nMr. Maples, in a few words, also bore testimony to the bona fides of the bankrupt. Dealing with the undue preference charged in the report, he was instructed that the estate had not suffered in any way on that account.\nIn giving judgment, the learned Registrar said he at first thought it was a case where the name of one person who had built up a reputable business was allowed to stop over the doorway long after such person had dropped out. As the hearing had progressed, however, he found that such was not the case, and was most decidedly of opinion that there was no intention whatever on the part of the bankrupt to deceive anybody. It appeared to him that the business was really in the hands of Messrs. Stewart the name of the bankrupt's name was to be wiped out, and the fact made public to the business so long as such business was in existence, and when the appeal in that of Messrs. Guy, Bevan, & Co. was to be heard, that fact made public to the world. He, therefore, came to the conclusion that the bankrupt had no not been guilty of any effort to deceive anybody, and the charge of misconduct must, therefore, fall to the ground inasmuch as he had not benefited in any way apart from the fact that his name had been mentioned, and from which he had never received a single sixpence. When the Court came to consider all the facts of the case they would come to no other conclusion than that it was a case of extreme misfortune. In the matter of the shares purchased from Messrs. Birch & Co., it was clear that the brokers had had an equitable claim to the shares, which it was impossible for the trustee to resist. The bankrupt simply entered into the transaction. There were no stances there had been no undue preference whatever in the transaction. There were no other charges against the bankrupt, and as it was alleged by the Official Receiver had both been dispelled there was no reason why the discharge should be suspended, and an immediate order would be granted. Unconditional order of discharge was accordingly entered.\n\nCANTLE, JAMES A., builder, Newtown, Gosport.—The first meeting herein was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Cambridge Junction, Portsmouth, on Tuesday.\n\nHUNT, W. F. J., builder, Stalbridge. W. F. J. Hunt, Assistant Receiver. The statement showed gross liabilities £1788 7s. 10d., expected to rank £923 11s. 6d., net assets £288 11s. 9d. The deficiency amounts to £635. The debtor commenced business seven years ago as a builder. He has undoubtedly been in a state of insolvency for a very considerable time. Pressure was applied he had to place under an execution a short time before the receiving order, and the Sheriff's officer requested to hand over the balance of £300 in his hands. The Official Receiver applied for an order to enable him to examine the Sheriff's officer. The examination was adjourned until the 5th March.\n\nCLAUDE, WILLIAM T., builder.—This debtor attended the London Bankruptcy Court last week for his public examination before Mr. Registrar Linklater. The deficiency amounts to £522. The debtor states he has lost since March, 1889. At the commencement of 1890 he considered that he was perfectly solvent. The examination was allowed to pass his examination.\n\nCOHEN, SAMUEL, cabinet maker, Portsmouth.—This case came before the Court at Plymouth, last week, when the debtor attended for examination. Mr. J. Greenway applied on their behalf, and Mr. Shelley for the Official Receiver. Mr. Jacob Marks, a brother-in-law of the bankrupt, who purchased the business, said Cohen, he advanced £100. Cohen bought a bill of sale, and he purchased the stock and the book debts for £103. He was a stranger. He continued the business for a few weeks; he sold the stock to an auctioneer for £150, and the book debts for £300. He considered that he had made more than £100 out of the transaction. He denied having any notice of the debt due to Wineberg, the petitioning partner. He believed every creditor had been paid 20s. in the pound. Mr. Wineberg, another brother-in-law, said Cohen went to Africa in October, 1889, and he and Mrs. Cohen there, who shipped goods to him in April last, the consignments being made twice a month, and varying in value from £50 or £400. He disposed of the goods for Mrs. Cohen drafts. The bankrupt went to Johannesburg in May last, and at his request witness went to Durban to dispose of his property, of value of £1,800. He did not know that an auctioneer advanced £1,200 on the goods, and not told to take this home with him. He and after paying Cohen some £200 for his charges there was a balance of £1,000 left, of which £200 was due to him for money lent, and £100 for his expenses. £100 was cabled home to a brother-in-law. The money home was £60, £45 was spent on jewellery, £25 was paid to Mr. Marks, and £69 to Mrs. Cohen. He did not know till August that Cohen was bankrupt, and when he understood he was in England. The examination then closed.\n\nFRANKS, W. R., builder, of Glenside Road, Highbury, N.—The bankrupt appeared at of Glenside Road, Plumstead, on Tuesday week for his public examination before Mr. Registrar Brougham. The statement showed liabilities £2,536 7s. 1d., and assets £936 7s. 1d. Under examination by the Official Receiver, the bankrupt stated that he had carried on business as a speculative builder, having commenced in 1881 with a capital of £100, the proceeds of which he savings as a piece-work carpenter. He had started as a builder he had no capital, and the other branches of the trade. No proper account had been kept. The failure was principally due to the losses on his Highbury and Plumstead operations. In 1889 he became aware of his insolvency, and a petition was served upon him in respect of a debt that he was sued in 1889 in respect of which he was jointly liable. The bankrupt admitted that creditors began to press him, and that in the early part of 1890 considerable pressure was applied he had to pay some of his debts to a somewhat large extent. The examination ensued as to some property obtained from the petitioning creditor by the bankrupt, and ultimately the examination was adjourned until the 5th March.\n\nPARSONS, SAMUEL LI., builder and contractor, Stalbridge. W. F. J. Hunt. The summary of debtor's state of affairs shows liabilities £1788 7s. 10d., expected to rank £923 11s. 6d., net assets £288 11s. 9d. The deficiency £988 11s. 9d. The receiving order was made on the petition of the debtor. The debtor commenced business about seven years ago as a builder. The debtor has undoubtedly been in a state of insolvency for a very considerable time. Pressure was applied he had to place under an execution a short time before the receiving order, and the Sheriff's officer requested to hand over the balance of £300 in his hands. The Official Receiver applied for an order to enable him to examine the Sheriff's officer.\n\nMahogany and Wainscot Logs, Planks and Boards, Whitewood, Oak, and every description of Hardwood and Lumber.
