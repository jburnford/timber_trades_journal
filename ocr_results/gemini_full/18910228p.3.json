The\nstatement of affairs shows liabilities £19,066,\nof which £11,666 is unsecured, and no assets nil.\nThe Chairman said that the debtor was not\npresent, but from information he had received\nit would appear that, having a capital of\nbetween £2,000 and £3,000, the debtor com-\nmenced business as a railway and harbour\ncontractor. He further states that he had\nacquired 1,400 shares in the West Workington\nHematite Iron and Steel Company, Limited,\nand in 1887 he became managing director of\nthe company at a salary of £800 a year. In\n1889 he became an ordinary director, his\nremuneration being £175 per annum only;\nbut he subsequently lost his qualification, the\nshares having been taken over by Mr. Penton,\nto whom he had mortgaged them. He\nattributes his failure to the sudden and\nunprecedented fall in iron in January and\nFebruary, 1890, and to losses made in con-\nnection with certain harbour works in Ire-\nland. There was no offer, and the proceedings\nwill be wound up in bankruptcy by the\nOfficial Receiver.\nPROCEEDINGS UNDER SEQUESTRATION.\nTRUSTEES AND COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED.\nEXAMINATIONS AND MEETINGS.\nBRUCE DAVID ANDERSON, Stobswell livery stables,\nDundee.
