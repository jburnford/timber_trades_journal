GAZETTE.
MACDONALD, KENNETH.—On Tues-
day the first meeting of creditors was held in
the London Bankruptcy Court, before Mr.
Hough (Official Receiver), under the failure
of Kenneth Macdonald, described as of Belle
Vue, Arrochar, Dumbarton, late of White-
haven, railway and harbour contractor. The
statement of affairs shows liabilities £19,066,
of which £11,666 is unsecured, and no assets nil.
The Chairman said that the debtor was not
present, but from information he had received
it would appear that, having a capital of
between £2,000 and £3,000, the debtor com-
menced business as a railway and harbour
contractor. He further states that he had
acquired 1,400 shares in the West Workington
Hematite Iron and Steel Company, Limited,
and in 1887 he became managing director of
the company at a salary of £800 a year. In
1889 he became an ordinary director, his
remuneration being £175 per annum only;
but he subsequently lost his qualification, the
shares having been taken over by Mr. Penton,
to whom he had mortgaged them. He
attributes his failure to the sudden and
unprecedented fall in iron in January and
February, 1890, and to losses made in con-
nection with certain harbour works in Ire-
land. There was no offer, and the proceedings
will be wound up in bankruptcy by the
Official Receiver.
