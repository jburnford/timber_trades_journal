BETWEEN 30 and 40 acres of young wood have been burned on the Seafield estate by a fire which broke out on the Morayshire side of Cromdale Hill. It is supposed that some sparks from a recent heather burning had set fire to a moss bank.

FIRE AT PAISLEY.—A slight fire broke out at the Ferguslie Fire Clay Works, Paisley, yesterday week. The outbreak was caused by a boy entering the store with a lamp.
