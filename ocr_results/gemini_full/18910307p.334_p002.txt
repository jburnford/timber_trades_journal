FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BETTS WILLIAM MITCHELL, formerly of Distillery Street and Magdalen Street, and now of Troy Street, Heigham, late builder and fruiterer, and now a builder.—Liabilities, £357 17s. 11d.; deficiency, £253 14s. 3d. Mr. J. Sadd appeared for the debtor. This case was heard at the Norwich Bankruptcy Court.—The debtor said he commenced business as a speculative builder in Norwich twelve years ago.—In reply to further questions, Betts said he was not a sporting man, though he had carried a borrowed gun. He had not done any betting for the last two years, and his highest bet was never more than 5s.—Mr. Sadd having examined the debtor, the examination was closed. A list of creditors appeared in the Journal on January 31st.

BLAZEY, BENJAMIN, of Wymondham, bricklayer and builder.—Liabilities, £196 1s. 9½d.; deficiency, £112 4s. 1d.—Debtor, in reply to the Official Receiver on the 23rd ult., said that when he started he had but very little capital. He only kept a day-book and

actually put in. Then he pulled up. His deficiency had not arisen during the last few years, but had been gradually growing. The examination was closed.
BROOKS, WILLIAM, of Hopton, near Thetford, cabinet-maker and upholsterer.—Liabilities £781 8s. 7d., deficiency £635 4s. 1d. Debtor, in reply to the Official Receiver at Norwich, said he commenced business in January, 1880. Prior to that he was employed by his father, and on the latter's death succeeded to the business. The arrangement was that he should take all the assets of the concern, and become responsible for all the liabilities. Debtor and his uncle, went through the stock, but it did not come up to the amount of the liabilities. He then took the amount of insolvency should be £150 or £160. His insolvency increased at first, but within the last two years he had reduced his indebtedness. He had parted with goods as security for payment of accounts, and he had not been able to redeem them. A great portion of his present liability was due to connections of his. The examination was closed.
CANTLE, J. A., builder, 57, Joseph Street, Lowtown.—This bankrupt attended at the Portsmouth Bankruptcy Court on Monday, for his public examination, before Mr. W. Renny. Mr. C. Moberley, Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade. Mr. J. F. Glanville appeared for the debtor, who said he commenced business twelve years ago with a capital of £100. He continued that for five years, when he failed. Could not say what dividend was paid, but he believed 1s. 6d. was paid. He obtained his discharge, and again commenced without any capital. He had to borrow money at the start. He hoped to make the business pay by selling his property. All his assets were in the properties he had built, so that there was no money of his own risked in the speculations but his creditors'. He had kept a day-book and wages-book, but no cash-book and bought ledger or profit and loss account. He lost £100 a twelvemonth ago, but he was then insolvent, and had been practically so since the liquidation. In November last he gave a charge to secure several bills he had given Mr. J. H. Cooper, a builders' merchant. He did not believe his property would produce the surplus he had estimated in his statement, though it ought to. The examination was closed.
CUBITT, THOMAS, builder, Fakenham. —On Wednesday week Judge Price gave judgment on a motion made at a previous sitting of the Norwich Court for an order that building materials, property, and effects on the land of Mr. Utting, which at the commencement of the bankruptcy were the property of the creditors, be disposed of amongst the creditors; and secondly, as the alternative, a finding that the said building materials were in the order and disposition of the bankrupt. Mr. Blofeld appeared for the Official Receiver, the trustee in the bankruptcy, and Mr. Chittock, for Mr. Utting, against whom the order was asked, the materials being on his land. As Mr. Utting agreed to pay Cubitt £480 by instalments, and had paid more in instalments than the debtor was entitled to, his Honour was of opinion the creditors had received the benefit. After reviewing all the circumstances, his Honour dismissed the motion with costs. The costs of the trustee were allowed out of the estate.
ECCARDT, ARTHUR J., builder, of Bromley.—This debtor attended at the Croydon Bankruptcy Court for public examination, before Mr. Registrar Fox. Mr. A. Mackintosh attended, and the debtor was represented by Mr. F. C. Slater, solicitor. The Official Receiver's report stated that the debtor estimated his liabilities at about £1,400, and assets nil. He commenced business in 1882 with a capital of £150, and he first became aware that he had not sufficient property to pay his creditors in full in September, 1890. He alleged that his insolvency was due to the foreclosure by the mortgagees, and to the pressure of creditors, compelling him to realise at a loss. In answer to the Official Receiver, the debtor said that on the 16th of July last his furniture

trar: In other words, you pocketed your brother's rent Debtor: Exactly. The debtor stated that he did not keep a cash book, and upon being pressed by the Receiver, acknowledged that he was unable to point out any entry in either of his books relating to the money which his brother had advanced him. His brother had no security at all. He did not tell his brother that he was insolvent. His brother first pressed him for the money in May, and other creditors were not pressing before that date. The furniture was sold privately to his father by the sheriff, and £88 was given for it. It was warehoused in Croydon for a fortnight, and then removed to Brighton. The furniture was removed to 11, Gloucester Terrace, Brighton, a house rented by his wife. The rent of the house was £90 a year, and he lived there with his wife. He had not made out a statement of his affairs, although he attended at the office of the Official Receiver the previous day for the purpose of doing so. The requirements were so stiff that he was not able to comply with the order, and should like some assistance. He thought he should be able to pay his debts, as he had prospective profits and contracts. The result of the proceedings was that he was unable to complete the contracts, and the equities he then had in his properties did not now exist. By that a number of bankruptcy notices had been sent to him during the past year. He went away from Bromley because everybody was jumping on him. He was not aware of there being any County Court summonses against him before May. The Registrar: I have very grave doubts in my mind, but you know better than I do. The debtor: I should like to-day to absolutely swear, but my impression is that there were not. The debtor further stated that when the execution was put in by his brother he thought he should be able to pull round, and that was the reason why he did not then file his petition. Mr. Slater, the debtor's solicitor, said that he would reserve his examination, and the case was adjourned for a month. A list of creditors appeared last week.
FINN, FREDERICK (trading as Evershed & Co.), timber merchant, 40, Arundel Road, and Custom House Wharf, Littlehampton, Sussex.—A meeting of creditors in this case was held on Wednesday at the office of the Chief Official Receiver, Railway Approach, London Bridge. There was a large attendance of creditors, and Mr. Paul A. Boulton, chartered accountant, of Cannon Street, was appointed trustee. The committee of inspection will consist of representatives of the following firms:—The National Discount Co. (Mr. Wolsey), Messrs. Churchill & Sim, Messrs. Bryant, Powis & Bryant, Messrs. Dolton, Limited; Messrs Dolton, and Messrs. Prescott & Co., and Messrs. Goodman, Hughes & Co. The remuneration of the trustee was left to be fixed by the committee of inspection.
Under receiving order dated 7th ult. accounts have been filed showing gross liabilities £13,064 14s. 3d., of which £15 258 5s. 9d., of which is expected to rank for dividend, and assets, after deducting £26 1s. 7d. for preferential creditors, £4,436 7s. 1d., thus showing a deficiency of £8,628 7s. 2d. The Official Receiver's observations are that the receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition, and he was adjudicated bankrupt on the 25th February, 1891. He states that during the years 1884 and 1885 he acted as manager for a Mr. Wotton, trading as Evershed & Co. at Littlehampton; that in 1886 Mr. Wotton suggested that the debtor should take over the business, which appears from the balance-sheets at that time to be insolvent. The debtor had no capital, but he agreed to take over the whole of the assets and liabilities. The lease appears to have remained in the name of Mr. Wotton, but is deposited at the bank as security for an overdraft by the debtor. The debtor further states that Mr. Wotton agreed to put the business on a firm basis, but no settlement appears to have ever been made, and the
