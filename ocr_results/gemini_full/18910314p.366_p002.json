Wreford, Senior Official Receiver, on Wednesday issued a summary of the accounts filed in this matter, from which it appears the gross liabilities amount to £1,236 8s. 8d., of which £1,034 2s. 8d. is expected to rank, and assets, after deducting preferential claims, £655 8s. 7d., or a deficiency of £400 14s. 1d. It appears from the observations of Mr. Wreford that the debtor was adjudged a bankrupt in April, 1885, with unsecured liabilities then amounting to £6,222, and assets estimated at £4,427, under which proceedings dividends amounting to 3s. 6d. in the pound were paid, and the debtor obtained his discharge. The debtor states he recommenced business as a timber merchant a few months after his previous failure, and was lent him by his brother-in-law. He attributes his present failure and deficiency entirely to losses by bad debts. He has not kept proper accounts of his expenditure, and no sheets and profit and loss accounts have been made out. The unsecured debts appear to have been contracted chiefly for goods purchased from June to December, 1890. The stock and office furniture were sold a few weeks prior to the receiving order under a distress for rent, and the household furniture is stated by the debtor to be the property of his brother-in-law, who purchased it under the former failure.\n\nBLAMEY, W. G., builder, Veryan.—A list of creditors under this failure was given in last week's JOURNAL. The bankrupt appeared at Truro on Saturday, before Mr. Registrar Chilcott, to undergo his public examination at the hands of the Official Receiver (Mr. G. Appleby Jenkins). Bankrupt said he had been in business for eighteen years, and when he filed his petition he had several contracts on hand. He received in respect of one of these £46 three days before he filed his petition and he sent £34 to the Eagle Steam Joinery Works, Plymouth, to meet an acceptance that was due the preceding day. He had other bills running then, and was fully aware he could not pay all his liabilities in full. The examination was closed.\n\nCOUSENS, H. J., & CO., Limited, dealers in lime, cement, builders' materials, &c., Bangor Wharf, 23, Lower Mall, Hammersmith. —The first meeting of creditors under the winding-up order of this company was held on Tuesday before Mr. C.

After a short discussion the creditors resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the chairman as liquidator.

In reply to Mr. H. K. Moseley, who appeared on behalf of Messrs. Rosher & Co., the debtor stated that he had kept no books, and therefore prepared the accounts partly from receipts and partly from memory. Pressed by Mr. Moseley as to his association with Messrs. Rosher, the bankrupt said he never put any cash into the business, but his interest in it was worth £1,000. Two cheques were produced which had been endorsed \"for large saw-bench\" and \"timber drag,\" respectively. The bankrupt asserted that the endorsements had since been made on the cheques, that the plant was transferred to the firm, and that the cheques he drew were on account of his interest in the business. Mr. J. F. P. Rawlinson, who appeared for the debtor, elicited the fact that on the 30th of June, 1887, there was a balance standing to Mr. Crannis's credit on the books of the firm of £400 odd. Mr. Moseley said the difficulty had arisen from the fictitious and visionary value placed by Mr. Crannis upon his interest in the business. After some conversation, the examination was closed.\n\nDYER, HARRY WILLIAM, knife-board manufacturer, Deptford.—The summary of debtor's statement of affairs shows gross liabilities £3,121 0s. 9d., assets £10,986 0s. 10d., surplus from fully-secured creditors £7,865 0s. 1d. The debtor is a knife-board manufacturer, and has carried on business since 1868. In 1879 he paid a composition of 6s. 6d. in the pound on unsecured liabilities of £6,000, and his discharge obtained. In July, 1880, the bankrupt gave a bill of sale to Mr. J. Oakey for £15,000 over the whole of his stock, fittings, &c. The debtor further agreed to keep up the premiums on the life policies and £10,000 as collateral security for the bill of sale. The premiums on the life policies and the interest on the bill of sale have proved a heavy drain on his business, but the debtor asserts that if his business realises its actual worth he should have a large surplus; he does not consider himself insolvent.

Hough, Official Receiver. The accounts showed liabilities £1,217 11s. 2d., and debts fully secured £13,610, with assets consisting of an estimated surplus of £1,590 from property held as security. The creditors include :—\n... ... ... ... ... £ s. d.\nArthur & Co., Penge ... ... ... 60 0 0\nBavis & Co., Leadenhall Street, E.C. ... 22 0 0\nGossling —, Union Court, E.C. ... ... 60 0 0\nGrover & Grover, Kentish Town Road ... 34 0 0\nGoodman & Co., Bishopsgate Street, E.C. ... 25 10 0\nJohnson —, Fulham ... ... ... 38 0 0\nMontgomrey & Co., Brentford ... ... 11 10 0\nPryor —, High Road, Kilburn ... ... 33 0 0\nIt appeared that the debtor commenced as a speculative builder the second time in 1887, having failed on a previous occasion. In the interval between the first and the second business he worked as a foreman at a salary. He had disclosed all his property, and was now doing no work whatever. The Chairman asked whether there was any value in the equities of redemption shown in the statement of affairs? The debtor said there ought to be, as all the materials had gone into the property. He had tried unsuccessfully to sell the properties, but still thought sufficient might be realised to pay off the mortgages and provide a surplus. No offer was made, and the proceedings will be wound up in bankruptcy by the Official Receiver acting as trustee.\n\nGERRARD, ARTHUR, builder, 439, Liverpool Road, N.—The receiving order in this case was made on a creditor's petition, the furnished showing unsecured liabilities £339 9s. 1d., and debts fully secured £475 13s. 6d., with no available assets. The debtor states that about twelve years ago he commenced business as a builder and decorator, with £5 capital, at Crossley Street, Liverpool Road, which, owing to disputes, was then dissolved, and he is under no liability in respect thereof. He further states that in 1886 (after working at his trade as a carpenter for about twelve months) he recommenced business at the last mentioned address and continued the same down to the date of the receiving order. He attributes his failure to loss (since March, 1890), occasioned, as he alleges, by the petitioning creditor, and to the costs and expenses (about £300) of an unsuccessful action brought by him against the petitioning creditor for trespass and breach of contract. The debtor makes no proposal, and has been adjudged bankrupt.\n\nGRAY & CO., builders, Chingford.—The statutory meeting of the creditors interested in the failure of Andrew Inglis Gray, trading as Gray & Co., builder and contractor, High Street, Chingford, took place on Tuesday at the offices of the Official Receiver, Temple Chambers, E.C., under the presidency of Mr. Cecil Mercer, the district Official Receiver. The debtor's statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £4,844 16s. 10d., of which £2,424 17s. 11d. was due to unsecured creditors, to fully-secured creditors £2,200 15s. 7d., the value of the securities being estimated at £3,235, thus leaving a surplus of £1,034 4s. 5d., which is carried to liabilities on bills other than debtor's own acceptances £200, which, however, are not expected to rank, to preferential creditors £19 3s. 4d., which is deducted per contra; to total assets amount to £1,520 11s. 9d., from which £19 3s. 4d. has to be deducted for the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaving net assets at £1,501 8s. 5d., showing a deficiency amounting to £923 9s. 6d. The report and observations of the Official Receiver are as follows:—The receiving order was made on February 7th, on the debtor's own petition. The debtor commenced to carry on business at Forest Gate in April, 1886, with a borrowed capital of £165 (still due). In September, 1886, he entered into a verbal agreement of partnership with a Mr. Frederick Nicholls, builder, of Chingford, the latter bringing £70 into the business, under the style of \"Gray & Nicholls.\" In the spring of the following year the partnership became dissolved. A house and premises built by the firm in Endlebury Road, Chingford, represent the entire property of the firm. The debtor states he is under no liability as regards this partnership, and that since the dissolution he has carried on business by himself.\n\nMahogany and Walnut Logs, Planks and Boards, Whitewood, Oak, and every description of Hardwood Lumber.
