Summers & Co. of very good quality, consisting of 7 to 11x3 and 6½x2½. The bright appearance of these early cargoes makes them attractive in the market.\n\nWe are now having a little movement in pitwood imports, quite a number of small fleet being reported in the Firth of Forth this week. The lengthened absence of these early cargoes makes them attractive in the market.\n\nThere is now rather a quietness in the deliveries taking place; colleries do not seem to be quite so busy at the moment.\n\nWe are glad to hear that some definite steps are to be taken towards effecting a change of meeting place from St. Enoch's Square; we feel sure the timber trade will generally heartily assist in bringing about the change.\n\nThere is no change in the condition of the home wood trade; a number of further extensive transactions have taken place during the week in lots of standing wood. Mr. H. Morgan, Crieff, has secured a large mixed lot at Glenshee, and Mr. Peter McGregor, Kintilloch, an extensive mixed lot at Persey, in Blairgowrie.\n\nThe Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society held their usual meeting of council on Wednesday. It was announced that the Board of Agriculture had renewed their grant of £100 for the current year, in aid of the lectures on forestry conducted by Dr. Somerville, Edinburgh University. The Transactions of the Society are expected to be\n\nAll dimensions from 22 to 70 ft. long.\n3 to 18 in. diam., always in stock.\nready for distribution in a few days, and we understand they contain a large amount of matter interesting and instructive on the subjects of forestry and the home timber trade.\n\nTRADE REPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nBusiness here moves in a quiet way, but still of sufficient quantity to keep the mills fairly well employed. There is not much new work coming out in the town, and forward orders are not plentiful, but the usual spring demand from the country districts should now shortly be making its appearance, and help to enliven matters a little. What business is being is being keenly competed for and prices in consequence show no improvement, but rather the reverse.\nShipbuilders have still a fair amount of work on hand, but we hear of very few new orders, and these mostly for small vessels, such as trawlers.\nAt Messrs. Fleming's sale on the 18th ult. there was a large turnout; indeed, it was generally remarked that the attendance beat the record here by a good way. The bidding was pretty brisk, and a considerable quantity of goods (principally Baltic) was disposed of at about current rates.\n\nDUNDEE.\nThere is practically nothing of interest to report in connection with the timber trade, no arrivals and no public sales. The saw-mills are all in fairly good work, but no approach to activity. Deliveries are being made in a fairly satisfactory manner. The stocks are appreciably declining, but they are still ample to withstand a greater amount of activity than is being experienced before the season is reached when general imports may be expected.\n\nGLASGOW.\nThere has been no material change to note as to the trade here during the past week. Imports are almost nil, and stocks are being steadily worked down, the deliveries from the public storage depôts in the harbour continuing to go on at an active rate. As pointed out recently, the quantities of deals delivered in January and February this year were considerably more than those of corresponding period last year, and the current month, so far, is also showing a decided increase in this respect. Next stocktaking, which takes place at the end of this month, will no doubt show a heavy consumption, both of log timber and deals, as gauged by the deliveries for the past quarter and consequent reduction of stocks.\nTransactions have been done to a great extent privately, the public sales, especially the more recent ones, having had rather small results.\nPrivate purchases made by shipbuilders contribute largely to lighten stocks of log timber.\nMessrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co. held a public sale here on 18th inst., the catalogue comprising black walnut logs, planks, and boards, also various other planks and boards, as satin walnut, whitewood (canary), quartered oak, &c. The transactions, so far as took place publicly, were restricted to the few noted below, difference of view as to prices (between exposers and buyers) being what hindered goods changing hands to a large extent:—\nU.S. black walnut, prime, 23¾ in. avg. sq., 8 logs, at 5s. 10d. to 6s. 5d. per cubic foot, averaging 6s. 2½d. per cubic foot.\nU.S. black walnut, medium quality, 19 in. avg. sq., 18 logs, at 3s. 7d. to 6s. per cubic foot, averaging 4s. 9½d. per cubic foot.\nQuebec 1st pine deals— Per c. ft.\n14 & 15 ft. 11x3 2s. 7d.\n\nMARCH 2[?]\n19 State of Ne[?] blocks-Benn[?] wood-Singer maple sheat[?] hhd. staves-\n16 Hibernian—I[?] 10,500 stave[?]\nMar. 9 Speranz[?] props-J.

The volume of business is fairly satisfactory, but not brisk. Deliveries from stock are in keeping with the extent of fresh orders, and the pond stocks are steadily showing a greater amount of bare water space. There have been no fresh arrivals since last report, although a number of pitch pine cargoes are fully due; indeed, one or two vessels are now over fifty days at sea. A cargo of greenheart has left Queenstown for discharge here. Singleton, Dunn & Co.'s public sale, which was to have been held on the 19th inst., has been again postponed. Allison, Cousland, & Co. will hold on sale here on the 26th inst.\nAt present there are only two vessels—Norwegians—fitting out in our harbour for Quebec, a great contrast to what was customary a few years ago, when quite a numerous fleet would be actively engaged at this time in making ready for the spring voyage to the St. Lawrence. These two vessels are said to have been fixed for the return passage at 17s. and 17s. 6d. per load. The two vessels referred to are all that are likely to leave here, unless some of the ships from the pitch pine ports are picked up for the Quebec market.\n\nLEITH.\nDuring the past week there have been a few arrivals of wood cargoes, viz, the Snafrid, and the Veranda, from Christiana with firewood, for Messrs. Ch. Salvesen, and the Otra steamer, from Hommelvik, with a full cargo of deals and battens divided between Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. and D. W. Beattie. A small sailer from Gothenburg with deals and battens, is also reported for Messrs. T. M. Summers & Co.\nThe public sale on Saturday, 14th inst., by Messrs. A. Garland & Roger was not exactly of their usual assortment, the catalogue being largely made up of oddments and broke-wood, and to suit the buyers of such goods the sale was held on the Saturday. The weather was fine and dry, although cold, and the principal object of the exposers was attained in an entire clearance being made of the unreserved lots, which in many cases were sold at a lump sum. Of the other goods there was not a great deal sold, but for what was placed prices were fairly good, and the exposers would have gladly seen a larger demand at the rates current. With the beginning of the week a change to stormy weather was experienced, and on Tuesday the rainfall was so excessive as to necessitate the postponement until the 24th inst. of the public sale announced by Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. The exposers were willing to have gone on with the sale, had the company present desired them to do so, but on the broker (Mr. Calder) putting it to the company it was resolved to postpone the sale for a week, when it is to be hoped better weather will prevail.\n\nCRAIG'S CASK HEADING COMPANY.\nMr. James Craig, stave and heading merchant, 39, Baker Street, Greenock, informs us that the capital of this company is £10,000, not £1,000 as stated in last week's issue.\n\nIMPORTS.\nALLOA.\nMar. 11 Signe—Halmstad—11,530 pit props—J.
