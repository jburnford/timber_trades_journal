In the early\npart of his time the business of slater was\nvery different from what it has since become.\nThe supply of roofing slates, in so far as not\nobtained from the local quarries at Foudland,\ncame from Ballachulish, the lighter Welsh\nslates being then unknown in Aberdeen. The\nintroduction of these, in which Mr. Keith\nled the way, made a material difference in\nthe strength of the roofing timbers, which up\nto that date had been deemed necessary to\ncarry the heavier kinds previously in use.\nEDINBURGH.—Plans by Mr. R. M. Cameron\nof 24, George-street, Edinburgh, have been\napproved for a new church and hall for the\ncongregation of the Warrender Park Free\nChurch.\nEDINBURGH.—Application has been made,\non behalf of the Caledonian Railway Com-\npany, in the Edinburgh Dean of Guild\nCourt, for warrant to proceed with the\nerection of the new Caledonian Station at\nthe west end of Princes Street, Edinburgh.",
