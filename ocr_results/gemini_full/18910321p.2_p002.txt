BUILDING NEWS.
ABERDEEN.—The death of Mr. William
Keith, senior, late slate merchant, at the age
of eighty-seven, is announced. Mr. Keith
went to Aberdeen in 1826. In the early
part of his time the business of slater was
very different from what it has since become.
The supply of roofing slates, in so far as not
obtained from the local quarries at Foudland,
came from Ballachulish, the lighter Welsh
slates being then unknown in Aberdeen. The
introduction of these, in which Mr. Keith
led the way, made a material difference in
the strength of the roofing timbers, which up
to that date had been deemed necessary to
carry the heavier kinds previously in use.
EDINBURGH.—Plans by Mr. R. M. Cameron
of 24, George-street, Edinburgh, have been
approved for a new church and hall for the
congregation of the Warrender Park Free
Church.
EDINBURGH.—Application has been made,
on behalf of the Caledonian Railway Com-
pany, in the Edinburgh Dean of Guild
Court, for warrant to proceed with the
erection of the new Caledonian Station at
the west end of Princes Street, Edinburgh.
