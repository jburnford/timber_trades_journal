TRADE REPORTS.

DUNDEE.
Business continues moderately good and with prospect of further early improvement, as considerable work is being estimated for, and a number of large jobs, principally tenements, have been already arranged.
There are no imports except a few small steamer cargoes of battens, which we hear of a number of small parcels of hardwoods, &c., coastwise.
A small steamer cargo of whitewood is now due from Drontheim.
The event of next week will be Messrs. Bell & Sime's periodical sale at the Dundee Sawmills, when the usual large assortment of Baltic and American goods will be exposed.

GREENOCK.
Business moves along in almost identical fashion with the past few weeks.
A fair number of sales are taking place, but at very keenly competed figures.
Deliveries have been proceeding steadily, if moderately, from the ponds, unless during a few stormy days' when log operations had to be suspended.
We are still without any fresh arrivals.
Some pitch pine cargoes have been a long time afloat—as long as sixty days in one case at least—and some anxiety is beginning to be felt as to their safety.
Owing to the Easter holidays we reserve our report of proceedings at Allison, Cousland, & Co.'s auction sale here on the 26th inst. until next week.
New works are immediately to be erected near the Albert Harbour for the manufacture of preserves by a new company here called the Scottish Fish Preserves Company, Limited.
The capital has all been subscribed locally.
We understand the joiner work has been given to Austin & Kinnaird.
The Glasgow and South Western Company have (subject to their Steam Vessels Bill passing the House of Commons) purchased the well-known river steamers Viceroy, Sultana, and Sultan to run the coast traffic of their line of railway.
These are inadequate for a full service, but orders are expected to be given out for the construction of three or four new boats whenever their Bill passes.
Scott & Co. launched from their Cartsdyke yard on Friday a splendid passenger steamer of 2,500 tons gross, called the Tatung, for the China Navigation Company, Limited.
She is intended for river traffic in China.

GLASGOW.
The only full cargo to note in the Glasgow timber imports of the past week is one of Honduras mahogany, per Meissel, from Belize, consigned to Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.
This cargo is presently discharging at Queen's Dock, and, as announced by the brokers, is to be brought to auction on Tuesday, 7th April next.
Other arrivals for the week consist of parcels per steam liners, from Baltimore and New York, chiefly oak planks and staves, walnut, hickory, and whitewood logs, considerable portions of which are going into consumers' hands ex quay, the rest being yarded for sale; there is also one parcel Austrian oak planks, which we understand has been sold at ship's side.
The ss. Alcides, another of the Baltimore steamers, has just arrived, and, along with general cargo, brings sundry parcels of wood goods.
Particulars will be fully noted in next week's import list.
They are said to comprise 75 logs poplar or whitewood, 49 logs walnut, 38 logs hickory, and about 3,700 pieces whitewood and oak lumber, also parcels of staves.
There is generally rather a quiet feeling, though among hardwood buyers some briskness of demand is experienced, and prospects for the sale of mahogany referred to above are good, as the wood is much wanted.
The freight market has no sign of improvement, and this, of course, does not tend to advance prices meantime.
Vessels now fitting out for the spring voyage to the St. Lawrence have been fixed for the return trip at 17s. to 17s. 6d. per load.
Very few are fitting out compared with the fleet of vessels that used to be seen in former years about this season.

LEITH.
Since last report the only arrival is a small cargo of battens per Haabet, from Laurvig, for Mr. D. W. Beattie.
As usual towards the close of the quarter orders fall off, and there is less activity in the deliveries from yards, but on the whole there is nothing special to complain of.
Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. held their postponed sale on Tuesday, 24th inst., and there was a large turnout of buyers both from town and country, as usual at this firm's sales.
The competition, however, was not active, and the broker did not get over the lots as smartly as could have been wished, but the waney board pine was practically cleared out at prices varying from 2s. 6d. to 2s. 10d. for the large timber and 2s. to 2s. 5d. for the smaller logs.
There was very little inquiry for oak, elm, or ash logs, but birch was sold freely at 1s. 10d. to 2s. 1d. and canary-coloured white wood at 2s. to 2s. 5d., all per cubic foot.
Unfortunately it came on very wet in the afternoon, and this interfered considerably with the sale of the deals and battens, floorings, linings, &c., but for what was sold of those goods fair prices were got.
A number of lots of Austrian wainscot logs were placed at 4s. 6d. per cubic foot, but the parcel was not cleared out.

METALLIC LATH MAKING.—Several American firms are doing a large business in metallic lath-making, which, it is reported, will supersede the old fir lath in the United States.
The cost is about 9d. per yard above the rough fir lathing.

FIRING A WOOD.—James Pyper, jun., farm-servant, residing at Greenheads, parish of Glenbervie, has been charged before Sheriff Hamilton-Grierson, at Stonehaven, with having on the 9th inst. set fire to a quantity of whins near Troup Hill, whereby about 60 acres of valuable growing timber—the property of Mr. James Nicolson, of Glenbervie—was destroyed.
Pyper pleaded guilty, and said that owing to the wind the fire got the better of him.
The Sheriff said it had been a serious matter, and he could not see any excuse for the deed.
A fine of 30s. was imposed, with the option of 14 days' imprisonment.
