The shipbuilding yards are not so brisk as formerly, but prospects are still considered good, and are showing a tendency to improve. We have two arrivals to report, viz., the F. W. Greenheart, for James Kennedy & Co., and the Zeenymph, from Demerara, also for James Kennedy & Co.\nAt Messrs. Edmiston's public sale on the 26th ult. there was a moderate attendance of the trade. There was a good demand for fresh goods, but only a small business was done publicly. Yellow pine deals, 1st quality, sold at 6d. per string of 64 cub. ft. per page; 2nd quality, at 5d. per page, at 22½d. per cub. ft.; 3rd quality, at 4d. per page, at 18d. per cub. ft., whilst several other parcels were reached.

The only imported are some parcels w York and Libau. Trade xtremely quiet, and this eflected in the public sale Beattie at the Edinburgh 31st. ult. No doubt this accounted for by Dobson, & Messrs. Park, following on of the previous week, opening of the new quarter.\n\nAPRIL 4, 1891.\nHowever that may be, the attendance was small, and the quantity of goods disposed of correspondingly restricted. The catalogue included some fresh shipments of deals and battens just landed from Drontheim and Laurvig, besides a variety of Baltic goods of last season's importation. For the fresh cargoes cheap prices were accepted for what was sold from quay, but for the better class seasoned goods higher rates were paid. The undernoted are the principal prices going at the sale :— Per lin. ft.\n11x3 red deals 2½d. to 3d.\n9x3 ,, 2¼d. to 2¾d.\n7x2½ red battens 1¾d. to 1 15/16d.\n6½x2½ ,, 1½d. to 1 11/16d.\n6x2 ,, 1¼d.\n11x3 white deals 2d. to 2¼d.\n9x3 ,, 1¾d. to 2d.\n8x3 ,, 1½d. to 1¾d.\n6½x2½ white battens 1¼d. to 1 7/16d.\n6x2 ,, 1⅛d. to 1¼d.\nSOUTH ALLOA.\nTrade in March has been considerably quieter than in the previous month, which may be accounted for by the extra demand for pitwood after the long railway strike. Deliveries from stock have, however, been going on, and the bulk is appreciably decreased.\nThe easterly wind has brought over a few small sailers with short props, but it is expected a month more will elapse before the import trade becomes general.\nThe Caledonian Railway Company's engineer has now been here and surveyed the ground lately acquired for the storage of wood goods, and it is expected that the necessary siding accommodation will be proceeded with at once.\nThe Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\nIMPORTS.\nALLOA.\nMar. 24 Poseidon-Skien-586 pcs. mining timber, 5,685 pit props-The Lochgelly Iron & Coal Co., Ltd.\nOrnau-Christiansand-10,075 pit props-Love & Co.\nBORROWSTOUNNESS.\nMar. 24 Familien-Warberg-23,978 pit props-Love & Stewart\n25 Starkodder-Drobak-25,894 pcs. pitwood-Jno.
