mewhat delayed for some weeks, and at present a brisk demand prevails. The shipbuilding yards are not so brisk as formerly, but prospects are still considered good, and are showing a tendency to improve. We have two arrivals to report, viz., the F. W. Greenheart, for James Kennedy & Co., and the Zeenymph, from Demerara, also for James Kennedy & Co.
At Messrs. Edmiston's public sale on the 26th ult. there was a moderate attendance of the trade. There was a good demand for fresh goods, but only a small business was done publicly.

Trade xtremely quiet, and this eflected in the public sale Beattie at the Edinburgh 31st. ult. No doubt this accounted for by Dobson, & Messrs. Park, following on of the previous week, opening of the new quarter.

However that may be, the attendance was small, and the quantity of goods disposed of correspondingly restricted. The catalogue included some fresh shipments of deals and battens just landed from Drontheim and Laurvig, besides a variety of Baltic goods of last season's importation. For the fresh cargoes cheap prices were accepted for what was sold from quay, but for the better class seasoned goods higher rates were paid. The undernoted are the principal prices going at the sale :— Per lin. ft.

SOUTH ALLOA.
Trade in March has been considerably quieter than in the previous month, which may be accounted for by the extra demand for pitwood after the long railway strike. Deliveries from stock have, however, been going on, and the bulk is appreciably decreased.
The easterly wind has brought over a few small sailers with short props, but it is expected a month more will elapse before the import trade becomes general.
The Caledonian Railway Company's engineer has now been here and surveyed the ground lately acquired for the storage of wood goods, and it is expected that the necessary siding accommodation will be proceeded with at once.
