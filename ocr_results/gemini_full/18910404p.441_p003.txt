FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BAILEY, JOSEPH G., builder, Green, West Bromwich.—This matter came for hearing at the Birmingham Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Parry. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £1,561, and assets estimated to produce £1,312. It appears that the bankruptcy took place under the Act of 1861, and the Assignee, who was trustee, relinquished his duties to the Official Receiver, when the Bankruptcy Act was passed in 1883. The Official Receiver stated that a composition of 10s. in the pound had been already paid, and he was of opinion that there would be another 7s. or 8s. in the pound. He produced the accounts and asked the Registrar to audit them. After the Registrar had complied with this request, he remarked that he was pleased to see so large a dividend paid, as he wished similar dividends were paid in more recent bankruptcies.

BINNIAN, THOMAS W., builder and contractor, Kidderminster.—The public examination of Thomas W. Binnian, trading as James Binnian & Son, as a builder and contractor, was held on Wednesday week, before Mr. Registrar Talbot, at Kidderminster. The examination was conducted by the Official Receiver. Mr. F. Burcher represented the debtor, and Mr. Collis, of Stourbridge, appeared for Mr. Mobberley, the trustee, appointed by the creditors. The liabilities were £4,862 8s. 9d., expected to rank £3,273 4s. 4d., assets £1,418 16s. 1d., deficiency £1,854 8s. 3d. The debtor was examined at considerable length by the Official Receiver as to his trading transactions. He attributed his position in some measure to having retained in his service old servants after the trade had fallen off, and to the loss on contracts, including the restoration of Areley Kings Church, the erection of some Board Schools, and of Milton Hall, in Lorne Street, Kidderminster. He admitted that his

payments in wages had averaged 46 per cent. of his total receipts, which was due to the fact that the firm had the reputation of first-class workmanship, which necessitated the payment of higher wages to the workmen. The examination was adjourned till April 28th.

CRAMPTON, JAMES, cabinet maker and upholsterer, 26, 28, and 30, Princess Street, Bury, Lancs.—The accounts filed in this case show gross liabilities £1,427 0s. 10d., of which £1,189 10s. 1d. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend, and assets estimated at £579 5s., from which £22 10s. 9d. is deducted for preferential claims, which leaves £556 14s. 3d., and shows a deficiency of £632 15s. 10d.

GEORGE E. & F. F. A., timber merchants, Hereford.—This case has again been brought up for hearing. The debtor did not appear, but a letter had been received stating that he left England at a few hours' notice, and did not purpose entering into any details or defence of his action in doing so. Mr. Bayfield, the accountant who went through the books, had given him to understand that there was a surplus after paying all just debts, and he trusted that his sister had been provided for out of the surplus fund. He took £55 with him, and gave a detailed list of his private property to Mr. Beddoe. He should return at some future date to allow himself the satisfaction of "evening up" matters, and would let them know when he was prepared to do so. The letter was dated from Minneapolis, U.S. The Official Receiver stated that he had taken upon himself to allow Miss George £3 per week. The trustees were then authorised to make such allowance.

GROVER, GEORGE THOMAS, carriage, cart, and van builder and contractor, Blenheim Grove, Peckham, and 21, Whittington Road, Asylum Road, Peckham.—The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held on Tuesday before Mr. H. Howell, Official Receiver. A quorum of creditors not being present, no resolution was submitted, and the estate will be wound up in bankruptcy, with the Official Receiver as trustee. The public examination is fixed for April 16th, 1891, at the London Bankruptcy Court.

HILL, LEWIS C., cabinet-maker, Paignton. —The first meeting of the creditors was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Plymouth, on Monday week, before Mr. J. Greenway, Official Receiver, at his offices since the seizure of his effects. The bankrupt afterwards attended at the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court before the Registrar, Mr. C. V. Bridgman, and in the course of his examination said that he had had illness until August, 1889, when the whole of his effects were seized and sold by the Sheriff. His present position was attributable to ill-health and pressure by creditors. Since August, 1889, he had been a journeyman only. The only book of accounts he had kept was a rough day book. In March, 1890, his liabilities exceeded his assets by £177, the deficiency being largely brought about by the payments he had had to make on judgment summonses. The furniture at his house was his wife's, it having been given her by friends since the seizure of his effects. The Official Receiver offered no objection, upon the application of Mr. J. P. Dobell, solicitor, the bankrupt was allowed to pass.

HORSFALL, JOHN, wheelwright and joiner, Burcott, in the parish of Bierton, near Aylesbury.—A summary of debtor's statement of affairs shows gross liabilities amounting to £430 12s. 0½d., of which £126 3s. 8d. is expected to rank for dividend, assets £89 1s. 9½d., leaving a deficiency of £37 1s. 10½d. The debtor alleges the cause of his failure to be bad trade.
