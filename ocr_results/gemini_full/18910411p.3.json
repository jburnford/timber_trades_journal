Mr. James Brown, manager,\npresided, and was supported on the platform\nby Mr. James Bell and Mr. Peter Sime, the\npartners of the firm; Councillor Stuart; Mr.\nGeorge Sime, Mr. Francis East, Mr. William Boigt, Mr. William Low,\nmanager, and others. After an excellent\naddress, in the course of which he congratulated the employes of Messrs. Bell &\nSime on the large turn-out that evening. He\ntook it that the large attendance on that\noccasion was one more proof—although none\nwas necessary—of the cordial relations which\nalways existed, between the firm and their\nemployes. The Dundee Harbour Trustees had recently\nmade proposals, the acceptance of which meant\nthe eviction of the firm. He, however,\nhoped that wiser counsels would prevail, and\nthat the scheme proposed by Messrs. Bell &\nSime would meet with the approval of the\nTrustees, as he thought it really deserved.\nEven with these temporary drawbacks, Mr.\nBrown had no doubt that the firm would\nmaintain its pre-eminent position in the timber trade of the district. The business, large\nas it was, was rapidly extending, and he knew\nfrom personal experience that what was\nwanted was not a curtailment, but an increase\nof their accommodation.\nMr. Sime, Mr. Bell, and Councillor Stuart\nafterwards addressed the meeting. A long\nand varied programme was sustained by a\nlarge company of ladies and gentlemen. The\nproceedings, which were of the most harmonious description, were terminated by the\ncompany singing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" A\nlargely-attended assembly followed, dancing\nbeing kept up with spirit till an early\nhour to the strains of Kinnear's quadrille\nband, Mr. James Coutts proving a most\nefficient M.C.",
