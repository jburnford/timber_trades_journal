A DUNDEE SAW-MILL MEETING.
The sixth annual festival and assembly of
the Dundee Saw-Mills employes was held in
the Thistle Hall, Dundee, yesterday week.
There was a large attendance of ladies and
gentlemen. Mr. James Brown, manager,
presided, and was supported on the platform
by Mr. James Bell and Mr. Peter Sime, the
partners of the firm; Councillor Stuart; Mr.
George Sime, Mr. Francis East, Mr. William Boigt, Mr. William Low,
manager, and others. After an excellent
address, in the course of which he congratulated the employes of Messrs. Bell &
Sime on the large turn-out that evening. He
took it that the large attendance on that
occasion was one more proof—although none
was necessary—of the cordial relations which
always existed, between the firm and their
employes. The Dundee Harbour Trustees had recently
made proposals, the acceptance of which meant
the eviction of the firm. He, however,
hoped that wiser counsels would prevail, and
that the scheme proposed by Messrs. Bell &
Sime would meet with the approval of the
Trustees, as he thought it really deserved.
Even with these temporary drawbacks, Mr.
Brown had no doubt that the firm would
maintain its pre-eminent position in the timber trade of the district. The business, large
as it was, was rapidly extending, and he knew
from personal experience that what was
wanted was not a curtailment, but an increase
of their accommodation.
Mr. Sime, Mr. Bell, and Councillor Stuart
afterwards addressed the meeting. A long
and varied programme was sustained by a
large company of ladies and gentlemen. The
proceedings, which were of the most harmonious description, were terminated by the
company singing "Auld Lang Syne." A
largely-attended assembly followed, dancing
being kept up with spirit till an early
hour to the strains of Kinnear's quadrille
band, Mr. James Coutts proving a most
efficient M.C.
