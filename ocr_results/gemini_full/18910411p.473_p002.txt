FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ANDREWS GEORGE, builder and wheel wright, Knightwick.—At the Official Receiver's office, Worcester, the first meeting of creditors in this debtor was held, the Official Receiver, Mr. Luke J. Sharp, presiding. The Official Receiver, in his report, stated that the bankrupt commenced business as a builder at Bishop's Cleeve, near Cheltenham, in 1879, with a capital of £100. He carried on business there till Christmas, 1888, when he removed to his present premises at Knightwick, where he has traded as a builder, wheelwright, and blacksmith. Whilst at Bishop's Cleeve the bankrupt had considerable building speculations. It would seem that when the bankrupt came to Knightwick he was insolvent to the extent of £400. The business which the bankrupt took over at Knigh wick was valued to him at £455 ; £200 of this he borrowed, and the balance has been paid out of his business by instalments. The gross liabilities amounted to £1,707 2s. 6d., of which £1,638 16s. 3d. are expected to rank for dividend. After deducting preferential creditors the assets amount to £447 5s. 11d., thus leaving a deficiency of £1,191 10s. 4d. After the debtor's examination has been concluded, the Official Receiver said it was a summary case, and he would act as trustee. The following are scheduled as creditors in this case :—

CASTELL, WILLIAM, builder, late of 10, Gloucester Terrace, Beckenham, now 20, St. George's Road, Beckenham.—The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this bankruptcy took p ace on Thursday week at the offices of the Official Receiver, 24, Railway approach, London Bridge, S.E., under the presidency of Mr. A. Mackintosh, Official Receiver. After reading through the proofs the Official Receiver stated that the debtor had made out a statement of affairs showing liabilities amounting to £564, and assets consisting of book debts estimated to produce £200, and other property £70, total £270. In answer to the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that most of the liabilities had been incurred in respect of materials for jobbing work. There was one secured creditor for £200, the security of which consisted of two cottages. Mr. Cooper, the trustee, had collected about £30 in book debts, and he had also some materials, which had been left on the land. One reason the contract for building the cottages had not been carried out by Mr. Cooper, was because the petitioning creditor did not allow sufficient time. If time had been allowed, the creditors would have received a composition of 10s. in the pound. The Official Receiver pointed out that the trustee had acted illegally in collecting the book debts, and using materials belonging to the estate, inasmuch, as the receiving order was made within three months after his appointment, and that Mr. Cooper would have to account for all moneys received and paid away. The meeting would not appoint Mr. Cooper, as trustee under the bankruptcy, as the Board of Trade would not allow it, but any other creditor could be appointed trustee, or they could appoint an accountant. A lengthy discussion followed as to who should be appointed trustee, and it was finally decided to appoint Mr. George Nathan Cocknell, as trustee, to act with a committee of inspection, consisting of the following gentlemen, Mr. Simmonds, Mr. Wright, and Mr. Gibson. It was also resolved that the trustee should receive no remuneration beyond out of pocket expenses, and the payment o premium on the guarantee bond.
