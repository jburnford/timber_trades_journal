W., timber dealer, 83 and 85, Curtain Road, E.C.—The receiving order in this case was made upon the petition of J. W. Jones & Co., Limited, of the Saw-mills, Cambridge Heath, and a sitting for the bankrupt's public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The liabilities were returned at £1,236 8s. 8d., of which £1,034 2s. 8d. are unsecured, and assets £633 8s. 7d., after providing for preferential payments. Upon examination by Mr. Gray (Assistant Official Receiver), the bankrupt said that he acquired his business premises about twelve years ago, and the lease had nine years to run. Since taking the premises he had put up some timber staging at a cost of about £500. In April, 1885, he was adjudged bankrupt, his liabilities being returned at £8,647, and assets £1,427, and he obtained his discharge. After that failure he continued to trade, first in his brother's name, and when\n\nTeak Timber and Rock Elm, first-class Yellow and Waney Pine Timber, and every description of Shipbuilding Wood.—Hoar & Brown\n\nMAY 2, 1891.\nhe obtained his discharge in his own name, and he borrowed money to enable him to do so. He attributed his present failure mainly to losses by bad debts. No creditor opposed, and the bankrupt passed his examination.\nBETTS, WM. MITCHELL, builder, Tringy Street, Heigham, Norfolk.—Before Mr. Registrar Cooke, at the Norwich Bankruptcy Court last week, the debtor appeared for adjourned examination. The liabilities are returned at £407 17s. 11d., and so small are the assets that the deficiency is £253 14s. 3d. In reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor denied having done any betting during the past ten years in amounts exceeding 5s. The examination was concluded.\nBUDD, J., builder, 86, York Street, Westminster.—The first meeting in this case was held on Friday, before Mr. Wreford, the Official Receiver. The debtor attended, and said that he was unable to make any proposal. Against unsecured debts amounting to £1,093 3s. 6d. he had returned his assets at £1,198 2s. 6d., but he did not anticipate that they would realise a substantial amount. The freeholders had taken possession of the various properties. Mr. Wreford said the statement of affairs was manifestly inaccurate, and must be amended. The creditors include:—\nBudd L., London ... ... ... £4 4 0\nCarter A., Cambridge Heath ... ... 875 10 0\nDell & Co., Lon on ... ... ... 12 13 8\nH skins J. & S n, London ... ... 97 0 0\nSmi h G. W. & Co., Clapham Ju ction ... 84 4 0\nShaifo d H., Holloway ... ... ... 84 0 0\nWeller W., Putney Bridge ... ... 40 0 0\nNo resolution was passed, and the Official Receiver will continue to act as trustee under the bankruptcy.\nCRAVEN, CHIPPENDALE, Sackville Street and Guildford Street, Brierfield, joiner and builder.—This is a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors. Unsecured liabilities £1,080 0s. 2d., estimated net assets £237 5s. 3d., creditors fully secured £336 14s. 10d. The following are among the creditors:—\nBrown C., West Hartlepool ... ... £ 4 4 0\nGray Jonathan, Liverpool ... ... 33 0 0\nHarrison & Singleton, Bradford ... ... 45 0 0\n... ... ... ... ... 85 0 0\nCRICKLEY, MATTHEW WILLIAM, Sidmouth, builder.—This is a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors. Mr. Albert L. Honey, 25, Catherine Street, Exeter, accountant, is trustee. Unsecured liabilities £516 12s., estimated net assets £430. The following are some of the creditors:—\nDevon & Cornwall Bank, Sidmouth ... £44 0 0\nFox, Elliot, & Co., Plymouth ... ... 100 0 0\nGabriel T. & Sons, Exeter... ... ... 14 3 6\nPutbury J., Sidmouth ... ... ... 166 15 10\nScannell W. & Son, Exeter ... ... 27 4 0\nWilson T. & Son, Exeter ... ... ... 16 11 6\n... ... ... ... ... 81 13 11\nCROAKER, W. H. & F.—The receiving order under this failure was made on November 25th last, and the debtors on Wednesday applied for the approval of composition resolutions passed by the creditors. They had traded as builders and contractors in Great Dover Street, and their statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £52,694, of which £13,998 will probably rank, with an estimated surplus in assets of £3,142. When the case was called on, it appeared that the assignment of the debtors' property referred to in the proposed scheme had not been executed by all the necessary parties, and it was also submitted that a draft deed which had been prepared was not in accordance with the terms of the scheme. After some discussion, Mr. Registrar Giffard intimated that he could not approve the scheme in its present form, but gave leave to apply within three weeks for the appointment of a new first meeting of creditors.\nDOWRELL, H B., builder, 18, Endell Street, W.C., and Forest Hill, S.E.—The debtor traded as Bowden & Dorrell, and Dorrell Brothers, and the first meeting of his creditors was held on Friday, before Mr. Brougham, Official Receiver. The unsecured liabilities were returned at £3,166 5s 8d., and the assets at £2.894 14s. 6d., the creditors including the following:—\nAdamant Company, Birmingham ... ... £ 4 4 0\nAddington & Co., London ... ... ... 50 8 2\nBowden H., Chelsea ... ... ... 130 12 10\nBeves & Co., Brighton ... ... ... 19 19 6\nBraby & Co., London ... ... ... 10 18 0\nBurt, Boulton, & Haywood, London ... 23 10 0\nChalkley G.
