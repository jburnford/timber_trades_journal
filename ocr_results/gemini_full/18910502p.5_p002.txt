BUILDING NEWS.
ALLOA.—The ventilation and heating of Alloa Park, the mansion-house of the Earl of Mar, have been entrusted to Messrs. Baird, Thompson & Co. ventilating and heating engineers, of London and Glasgow, who are introducing their well-known Æolus waterspray system.
DUNDEE.—At the last meeting of the Edinburgh Architectural Association a paper was read by Mr. A. H. Millar, Dundee, on "Curiosities of Architecture in Dundee." In giving a sketch of Dundee in stone and lime, Mr. Millar exhibited views of the Old Steeple with ground plan and section; Lady Wark Stairs, the Wishart Arch, Dudhope Castle, the Old Custom House in the Green Market, known as Drummond Castle; interiors of some of the chambers in the Franciscan Nunnery, and sculptured stones taken from the vault and from Whitehall Close. These buildings in date ranged from the fifteenth to the close of the seventeenth century. Passing to the examination of more modern buildings, Mr. Millar alluded to the great change introduced by William Adam, the architect, by his design for the Town House, erected in 1734, and showed that many buildings of last century—St. Andrew's Church, the Trades Hall, the Episcopal Chapel, afterwards known as Union Hall, and Trinity House—had been suggested by it. The next branch of the subject led him to the consideration of the architecture of the olden time, and in a series of views, chronologically arranged, he showed the development of the modern streets from the wynds and closes of former times. The inner architecture of the closes—the courts and back tenements—were next illustrated by a number of views and descriptions of public buildings erected in Dundee during the last fifty years, which showed the great variety in styles of architecture now visible in the city. Mr. Millar acknowledged his obligation to Mr. A. C. Lamb, who had kindly placed at his disposal a selection from his extensive collection of sketches of Dundee in the olden time.
AYR.—The pedestal which has just been completed for the statue of Burns at Ayr, by Mr. Taylor, is the largest of the kind ever executed in Aberdeen.

DUNDEE.—The Harbour Trustees recently inspected and tested a full-size section of an automatic tramway system invented by Mr. David Cunningham, their engineer, designed to facilitate the work of discharging jute and other cargoes at the harbour. The completed portion is 150 yards in length, and the operations conducted with ordinary bales of jute were thoroughly satisfactory, the cars being loaded and emptied with wonderful precision. In unloading a jute vessel all that is required is a platform for receiving the bales. These are then delivered through a shoot, which automatically deposits a bale on each car as it passes underneath the platform. By this means it is estimated that as many as from 10,000 to 12,000 bales of jute could be discharged from one steamer in a working day of 10 hours.
