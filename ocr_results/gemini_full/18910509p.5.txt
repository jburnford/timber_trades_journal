ZANZIBAR VILLA, Dyce, Aberdeen, the residence of the late Mr. Alexander Burgess, wood merchant, has been sold by private bargain by Messrs. Allan, Buckley Allan, & Milne, advocates.
WATERWAY TO PAISLEY.—The river Cart, after being deepened and widened from the town of Paisley to its junction with the Clyde, was formally opened for navigation on Monday. The depth of the river is now 18 ft., and the width 180 ft. The cost of the works was £130,000. It is believed that the new waterway will do much to develop the trade of Paisley.
QUICK DISPATCH OF BRIDGEWORK. — A special goods train, comprising 38 fully loaded waggons with bridges for India, has been dispatched from Messrs. Alexander Findlay & Co.'s Parkneuk Bridgeworks, Motherwell. The train was booked direct to Barrow, for shipment to India, by order of the India Office, for Indian State railways. The train was drawn by two locomotives, and was 360 yards long over all. Messrs. Findlay & Co. have still a good quantity of Indian bridges on order.
A WOOD-CARVING SCHOOL AT BALMORAL. —Quite a new feature of industry has come into vogue at Balmoral Castle during the winter and spring months. This is an artistic school for wood-carving, under the direct patronage of the Queen, who had the class opened last season before leaving for Windsor. All expenses in connection with the new industry are defrayed by Her Majesty. The teacher is Mr. George Reid, Balmoral, who made his mark while at Braemar in the same artistic work.
