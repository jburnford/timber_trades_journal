The Official Receiver, Mr. A. Mackintosh, attended, and Mr. C. A. Fox appeared for the debtor. In reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he made an assignment on the 16th of January last, and Mr. Cooper became trustee and went into possession of his property. Bankrupt had had a contract with the Rev. Mr. Phillips to build certain property and Mr. Cooper went on with the work. There were then two cottages to finish. He attributed his present position in the Bankruptcy Court to bad debts. He was formerly interested as leaseholder in ten cottages, but was not so now. These ten cottages cost him £1,500 or £1,600 to build, and Mr. Phillips advanced about £1,400, and became security for his bank for £200. Five of these cottages had been sold for £837, of which amount £470 had been paid back to Mr. Phillips. He said he now owed £240 or more. The Rev. Mr. Phillips is the mortgagee of this property, and he took possession as soon as the assignment was made. The examination was at this point adjourned.\nBUTLER, EDWARD, & BUTLER, NOAH, coach, cart, and van builders, Buckingham Road, Harlesden.—These debtors, who traded as Butler Bros., filed their petition last Monday at the London Bankruptcy Court, and the usual receiving order was duly made by Mr. Registrar Brougham. The debtor Edward stated that both he and his brother reside at Rockledge Avenue, Harlesden, where they have furniture to the value of £20. At their work-shops, in Buckingham Road, they have materials £10 and fixtures. There are book debts for £10 due to the estate, but they have\n\nImported Teak Planks, in all thicknesses and widths, are sold by Hoar & Brown, East Wood Wharf, West India Docks, E.

Certain carriages and vans upon the premises have been left for repairs and are not their property. The Sheriff of London is in possession at the suit of a creditor. The amount of liabilities was not stated.\nCASTLE, JOHN ALFRED, of Folkestone, builder.—At the Canterbury Bankruptcy Court on Monday last, before Judge Selfe, application was made for the discharge of the debtor, for whom Mr. Watts appeared. Mr. Mowll, Official Receiver, stated that the receiving order was made in November, 1890, and a first and final dividend of 5s. 6d. in the pound was expected to be paid. The debtor, with a capital of £30 saved while a journeyman, started business as a speculating builder at Folkestone about six years ago. Considering his limited means, he appeared to have been concerned in very large transactions. His failure appeared to have been caused by his being unable to dispose, at remunerative prices, of his property. He preferred the usual \"stock\" charges, but he questioned arose whether a man with only £30 capital was justified in starting these large building transactions. He must say that the creditors who attended the meeting were all in the debtor's favour. Mr. Watts said it was hardly correct to say that the debtor started as a speculator, because he built to order for some time. He urged that the books kept were sufficient. The judge said that no doubt the debtor was engaged in a business of a speculative nature, which had not turned out satisfactorily. The allegations of the Official Receiver were sustained, but the case was not a serious one, and, in granting the discharge, he should suspend it for three months.\nCHAPPELL, WM. THOS., picture frame manufacturer, Penzance.—This bankrupt attended at the Truro Bankruptcy Court for his public examination. Replying to the Official Receiver, he said he commenced eight years ago with a capital of £30. He did very well for six years, when he was induced to invest £180 in the purchase of a steam roundabout. He had lost through this. He held nine policies in the British Workmen's Insurance Company, which he held on the lives of nine persons. He had taken these out at various periods since 1885, and paid weekly contributions to the amount of 6s. 4d. Only in two cases did the assured know of the existence of the policies. The examination was closed.\nCOLLARD, ARTHUR, 132, Clapham Road, S.W., builder.—Deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors. Trustees, Alfred Adlin, Richmond, Surrey, timber merchant, and another. Dated 28th April, 1891. Filed 5th May, 1891. Unsecured liabilities £1,112 14s. 3d., estimated net assets £2,143.

Wreford, senior Official Receiver. He originally filed accounts showing total liabilities £6,059, of which £1,469 are unsecured, and assets valued at £3,386, mainly consisting of a surplus from securities deposited with creditors. Upon being questioned respecting such surplus, he admitted that the probability of realising it was small indeed; and being ordered to amend the statement of affairs, he subsequently filed accounts showing the same liabilities, but assets valued at only £86 9s. 1d., thus disclosing an estimated deficiency of £1,383 8s. 9d. The proofs having been called over by the Chairman, the debtor stated that he was unable to put forward any offer. The mortgagees had taken possession of all his properties, with the exception of Little Sutton Street. The meeting passed no resolutions, electing to leave the estate in the hands of the Court, to be wound up in the usual course of bankruptcy. The public examination was appointed for the 27th inst.\n\nYellow and Red Elm, first-class description of Shipbuilding Wood.—Hoar & Brown.\n\nMAY 16, 1891.\nHARRISON, JOSEPH MARTIN, Norman Street and Portland Street, Lincoln, builder and contractor.—This is a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors.

The assets are £72 17s. 2d. The alleged causes of failure are unfortunate speculations in building, stopping of work during the winter in consequence of severity of the weather, and action taken by the London and County Bank. The debtor commenced business about six years ago with a capital of £500. In December last he consulted his creditors, and borrowed £400 upon the security of a charge over his properties, which has entirely absorbed any surplus value there may have been on the properties. The debtor now states he underestimated his liabilities at this date, but he divided the money equally amongst his creditors. Among the creditors are :—\n... £ s. d.\nCouzens G.

Ray, jun., for whom he had been manager. He states he was enabled to do this\n\nMahogany and Walnut Logs, Planks and Boards, Whitewood, Oak, and every description of Hardwood Lumber.
