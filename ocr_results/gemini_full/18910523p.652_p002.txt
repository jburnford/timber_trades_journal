THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 653
MAY 23, 1891.

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
CLAIM FOR TIMBER SUPPLIED.
KUBB v. HAWKINS.
In the Westminster County Court, on Wednesday week, the case of Kubb v. Hawkins was tried before his Honour Judge Bayley, and was an action by the plaintiff, a builder, carrying on business in Euston Road, to recover the sum of £7 10s. for timber supplied to the defendant, also a builder, of Whitcomb Street, under somewhat peculiar circumstances. The plaintiff was called, and said he had known the defendant for some years, and it was his custom, when he was busy, to give him employment. On one occasion the defendant got an order for a rather large job, but being short of money at the time, and not having sufficient to purchase the necessary timber for the completion of the work, he asked him (plaintiff) if he would allow him to go to his merchant and get the timber in his name, and he would pay him for it when the work was completed. That request was complied with, and goods to the extent of the present claim were still owing for. The defendant had paid sums, from time to time, on account, but they had all been accurately entered in a book, and full credit had been given for every instalment which had been paid. The transaction had been an extremely unsatisfactory one, inasmuch as the defendant had not shown a disposition to pay. For the defence it was contended that several sums which had been paid had not been given credit for, and even if there was a balance owing, it was agreed that he (defendant) should pay it back by doing work for the plaintiff, and not in cash. That assertion, however, was stoutly denied by the plaintiff, who said he was unable to employ the defendant now in consequence of his independence, and he had refused to do any work unless ready money was paid. The learned Judge, after examining the various documents produced by the parties, gave it as his opinion, that the defendant had been credited with all the money he had paid, and that the balance now claimed was properly owing. Judgment, therefore, would be for the plaintiff, for the amount claimed, with costs.

EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY.
GOUGH v. SMITH.
His Honour Judge Brynmor Jones gave judgment at the Cheltenham County Court, on Friday, in an action brought by Edward John Gough, aged 17, against Cornelius Smith, timber merchant, and saw miller, under the Employer's Liability Act, to recover damages for injuries sustained on October 3rd, 1890, owing to the alleged negligence of a foreman named Elliott, who was in defendant's employ. The defendant was in the habit of undertaking sawing work, and he undertook a contract at Ginting, where he erected a steam engine and three circular saws and sent a number of his men to do the work. The plaintiff had been at work in front of a frame saw, and he was ordered by the foreman to leave the saw and cut staves. When the plaintiff had cut a dozen or so he took one of the boards to Elliott, as he thought they were not cut smoothly, and he directed him to go on, adding " they would do." The plaintiff returned to his work, and some ten minutes after he was pushing a stave against the saw, when his hand slipped, and he sustained grave injuries. He was taken to the General Hospital at Cheltenham, and it was there found necessary to amputate his fingers and thumb. It was admitted that the benches in which the saws were fixed were not fastened to the ground, however that was of not much importance, as the weight of the shafting kept the machines reasonably steady.
His Honour said that the decision he had come to was that the work was dangerous even to a man of average skill, size, and strength, and when the plaintiff attempted to cut staves there was more than ordinary risk. There was no doubt that these were the material facts of the case. He did not think the plaintiff had reasoned to himself about the risk he ran, he had simply obeyed the foreman's order, and it was the foreman's duty to reason for him. It was really not plaintiff's own will, but the will of the foreman that determined him to do the work, therefore he must give a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. With regard to damages, taking into consideration that the plaintiff was maimed for life, he must give the

full amount of the three years' wages, which the Act allowed, and as the plaintiff was receiving 13s. per week at the time of the accident he gave judgment for £100 and costs.

BARRELS FROM SOLID LOGS.—A core saw, intended for boring out barrels from solid logs, was recently completed at Taunton, Mass., for a company in Lacrosse, La., says the Monetary Times (Toronto). The saw is made of wrought iron, and steel cutter teeth are distributed about its edge. At the trial the machine bored out a core 10½ in. in diameter and 21½ in. long in thirty seconds. A manufacture of barrels by these machines is to be built in Louisiana. This appears to be reversing the operation for some years practised by the Anchor Manufacturing Company of Detroit, which was to put sections of elm logs into large steam vats, and after they became soft put them into a machine resembling a turning-lathe, which cut a veneer three-eighths of an inch thick off them. This veneer was afterwards gored by a number of circular saws for the purpose of giving the barrels bilge shape. The cylinders were then fitted with heads, hooped with wooden hoops strengthened by copper wire, and made a neat and perfect package suitable for flour and other barrels.
