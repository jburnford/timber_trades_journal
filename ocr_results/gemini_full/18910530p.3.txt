SOUTH ALLOA.
Since last report an improvement has taken place in the import trade, and the harbour here is now full of loaded vessels.
Their cargoes consist chiefly of short props from west coast of Norway and Sweden.
A considerable proportion of the imports is being sent direct to the collieries from ships' side.
It appears there is no scarcity of orders, but traders complain of the very low prices obtained for their goods.
