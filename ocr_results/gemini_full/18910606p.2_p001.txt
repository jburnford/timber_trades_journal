JAMES LAIRD & SON, having received instructions from Messrs. Ferguson, Davidson, & Co. to SELL the whole MACHINERY, PLANT, BUILDINGS, &c., beg to intimate that the Sale of Machinery, Plant, and residue of Stock will take place on TUESDAY, 16th June, and the Buildings shortly after.
Further particulars in Catalogues and advertisements, or from the AUCTIONEERS, 19, Gordon Street, Glasgow, 11th May, 1891.

spread over the whole of the pitwood ports of the Firth of Forth, and the stocks where beginning to assume excessive proportions. The deliveries are good, but their effect is scarcely noticeable in the face of the superabundant supply arriving daily.

The public sale at Tayport last week drew a large company, and Messrs. Donaldson were able to clear off a considerable quantity of goods and old parcels, which will make room for a number of imports daily expected.

We notice at Dundee an arrival of a large cargo of pine deals, birch, and ash from Montreal, for Bell & Sime, which is unusually early for the east coast. This cargo will be publicly offered at the firm's sale on Monday, 15th inst.

In connection with the shipbuilding trade in the Clyde, the past month shows more satisfactory results in the fresh orders booked, these amounting to pretty nearly the tonnage of vessels launched.

The Leith timber trade was glad to notice the return to business of Mr. F. Walkingshaw, after his long and serious illness of nine months' duration. His happy and genial company on Tuesdays was missed.

There have been few oak bark transactions. What have been carried on are practically the same as last year for old timber bark, but for superior coppice bark merchants are still holding out for a 3s. advance, and there is every probability of something like this rate being the basis for the season's business.

There is nothing of an interesting nature to note in connection with the home-grown timber trade; business is steadily maintained, without change of condition in any respect.

TRADE REPORTS.
DUNDEE.
Trade continues steady, although somewhat quiet, as usual about Term time.
There is considerable work in progress in town, and we believe the architects generally are busy with plans of further proposed buildings.
We notice large arrivals coastwise of

mahogany logs, kauri pine, sequoia, satin walnut, foreign larch, &c., for Bell & Sime, while the large steamer Escalona is expected every tide with fresh American goods from Montreal, comprising, we believe, birch logs for Fleming & Barry, J. & A.

Messrs. Jas. Donaldson & Sons held their sale at Tayport on Wednesday, the 27th ult., with a good company, and a good sale was experienced, and large clearances were effected. Messrs. Cameron Bros. held a sale at Perth on Monday, 1st inst., and there was, we understand, a fair turn-out of buyers, and considerable business done.
Messrs. Bell & Sime advertise a sale at Dundee on Monday, 15th inst.

LEITH.
The list of arrivals for the past week is a fairly long one, comprising besides two sailer cargoes from Namsos, for Messrs. A. Garland & Roger, a steamer shipment of deals and battens, per Tronda (s), from Drontheim, for same importers. The first open-water shipments from the Baltic ports are now coming to hand, and the week's list includes the Amaranth, from Stettin, with oak and fir timber, and the Impi, with deals and battens, from Helsingfors, both for Messrs. John Mitchell & Co.; also the Victoria, from Rafso, with similar cargo, for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. There are also some arrivals of oak staves from Memel, rickers from Riga, and a cargo of firewood, per Saphir, from Christiansand.
The public sales were resumed on Tuesday, 2nd inst., when Mr. D. W. Beattie offered a varied assortment of deals and battens at the Edinburgh Dock. The catalogue included some of the new season's Petersburg goods, just landed ex Moscow (s), from Cronstadt, for which there seemed a good demand, the market having been rather bare of such for some little time. There was only a moderate attendance of buyers, but a fair amount of business was done, and prices may be reported generally satisfactory, as may be seen from the quotations given below:—

GLASGOW.
The arrivals to note here for the past week have been light. There has been no full cargo, but a good many parcels of the usual description per steamships from the States, comprising walnut, whitewood, and oak (logs, planks, and boards), also staves to a considerable amount. In particular, it will be observed from the import list, the Robina (s), from Baltimore, brings a variety of wood goods. The walnut logs per this steamer, stated to be 641 logs, are mostly very small sizes.
Prices continue fairly well maintained for walnut logs of good quality and medium to large sizes.
Among the other consignments by same steamer we observe a parcel of superior whitewood logs.
There have been no further parcels of deals per steamers from Montreal landed at Yorkhill Timber Wharf since those included in the list of last week.
The Sarmatian (s), from Montreal, arrived on Tuesday last, but had a comparatively small quantity of deals on board, and these with other goods were discharged on south side of river at the regular Allan line berth. It is understood these deals are for Messrs. Brownlee & Co. The Colina (s), one of the Donaldson liners, is now expected, and has a pretty large shipment of deals.

CAMPERDOWN SAW-MILLS, DUNDEE.
Owing to the generally smaller stocks in Yorkhill Yard, as compared with those of a year ago, there are at present a good many vacant spaces open to be occupied by the new arrivals, but still the accommodation is far short of what it ought to be at the beginning of an import season.
There have been no auction sales to report since last writing. Deliveries continue steady. Of deals and planks the total for last month from Yorkhill yards alone was 91,182 pieces.
The Clyde shipbuilding returns for May are of an encouraging nature, new contracts having been booked to the extent, it is stated, of about 25,000 tons.
The tonnage launched from Clyde shipyards during the past five months amounts to 127,226 tons.
