FISHER, DAVID, builder, 47, Keir Street, Pollokshields.—In the Sheriff Court, this debtor was in bankruptcy before Sheriff The sederunt comprised Mr. John Steuart, Glasgow, for M'Lean & Glasgow, law agents in the sequest[?]; Mr. James C. Paterson, C.A., Glasgow, trustee; and Mr. J. W. M'Laren, Glasgow, for creditors. Bankrupt stated that he was 58 years of age. The statement of affairs gave his liabilities at £23,686 4s. 3d., and the assets, after deducting £25 13s. 8d. of preferable claims, to £107 6s. 4d. No further questions were put, as it was stated that the trustee had already received from bankrupt a full explanation of his affairs. In answer to Mr. M'Laren, the bankrupt stated that about fourteen years ago he assigned the seven tenements known as Keir Place, Pollokshields, and the villa Douglas, Ayton Road, Pollokshields, and Douglas Villa, Pollokshaws, to his brother, George D. Fisher, London, for about £10,000. He afterwards factored the properties for his brother. The examination was then closed, and the statutory oath administered.
