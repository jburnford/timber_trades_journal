  "text": "LEITH.\nThe arrivals during the week are not excessive for the season of the year, and do not make up a long list.\nThe *Vonda* (s), from Drontheim, has brought 18,688 deals and battens, and the *Ennsmore* (s), from Riga, 11,833 pieces lath-wood, and 8,170 deals, distributed among various importers.\nThe sailing cargoes consist of the *Oscar*, from Tvedestrand, with 41 fathoms firewood and 1,602 battens, for C. Salvesen & Co.; the *Hilma*, from Rafso, with 15,694 deals and battens, for Park, Dobson, & Co.; the *Annie*, from Halmstad, with 6,171 deals and battens, for D. W. Beattie.\nThere has been no public sale in Leith this week, and, with the end of the quarter in view, orders have not been so numerous, although business on the whole keeps fairly steady.\nThe periodical sales of wood at the Edinburgh Exhibition buildings, of which there was one on Wednesday, 24th inst., are distributing a considerable amount of stuff, and this is telling against Leith importers, chiefly as regards common cheap goods.\n\nMOTHERWELL.—The mineral subsidences at Mother-well consequent on the mineral workings by Messrs. John Watson & Co., Limited, mineral tenants of the Duke of Hamilton, under the Ladywell district, continue, the *Glasgow Herald* says, to become of more serious dimensions.\nPreviously the wreckage of property was confined to North Orchard Street and Clydesdale Street; now it is apparent that buildings in Ladywell Road are feeling the effects of the subsidences, and serious results are anticipated.\nLarge cracks have been made in the walls.\nIn the tenement of houses first affected the destruction is more visible.\nUnable to stand the heavy pressure, several of the stones in the lower portions of the houses are bulging out and falling away.\nThe walls are also severely twisted, the result of the wrenching being that long cracks have been left, these in some cases being inches in width.\nIn an aperture between the gables of two blocks which previously were connected sparrows were lately to be seen building their nests.\nSeveral of the houses have been deserted, and are presently under repair.\n\nD.
