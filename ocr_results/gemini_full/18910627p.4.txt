LEITH.
The arrivals during the week are not excessive for the season of the year, and do not make up a long list.
The *Vonda* (s), from Drontheim, has brought 18,688 deals and battens, and the *Ennsmore* (s), from Riga, 11,833 pieces lath-wood, and 8,170 deals, distributed among various importers.
The sailing cargoes consist of the *Oscar*, from Tvedestrand, with 41 fathoms firewood and 1,602 battens, for C. Salvesen & Co.; the *Hilma*, from Rafso, with 15,694 deals and battens, for Park, Dobson, & Co.; the *Annie*, from Halmstad, with 6,171 deals and battens, for D. W. Beattie.
There has been no public sale in Leith this week, and, with the end of the quarter in view, orders have not been so numerous, although business on the whole keeps fairly steady.
The periodical sales of wood at the Edinburgh Exhibition buildings, of which there was one on Wednesday, 24th inst., are distributing a considerable amount of stuff, and this is telling against Leith importers, chiefly as regards common cheap goods.

MOTHERWELL.—The mineral subsidences at Mother-well consequent on the mineral workings by Messrs. John Watson & Co., Limited, mineral tenants of the Duke of Hamilton, under the Ladywell district, continue, the *Glasgow Herald* says, to become of more serious dimensions.
Previously the wreckage of property was confined to North Orchard Street and Clydesdale Street; now it is apparent that buildings in Ladywell Road are feeling the effects of the subsidences, and serious results are anticipated.
Large cracks have been made in the walls.
In the tenement of houses first affected the destruction is more visible.
Unable to stand the heavy pressure, several of the stones in the lower portions of the houses are bulging out and falling away.
The walls are also severely twisted, the result of the wrenching being that long cracks have been left, these in some cases being inches in width.
In an aperture between the gables of two blocks which previously were connected sparrows were lately to be seen building their nests.
Several of the houses have been deserted, and are presently under repair.

JACK, JAMES,
George Street, W.—The bankrupt's public examination came on for hearing in the Sheriff Court, before Sheriff Hamilton.
The debtor's summary of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £6,900, and assets estimated to produce £1,085.
In course of his examination the bankrupt stated that he started in business in 1874 with his brother, as joiners and builders in Leith.
They had put up between them a capital of £6,900, on specification of which the failure of the City of Glasgow Bank, some years ago, the property had depreciated.
He left the firm in 1886, and was unable to get out of his liabilities in connection with the firm.
In December last his brother made a claim upon him for £1,000, and property in consequence had been sold.
He had to convey to them his life policy.
He offered him in Stra[?]hblane, but his brother declined, and he had been sequestrated.
He had only recently been aware of the sequestration.
The examination was adjourned.
