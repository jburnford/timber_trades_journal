FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BROOKS, JOHN LABETT, builder, Uffacombe.—At the Barnstaple Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, before the Registrar, Mr. G. Bosson, this bankrupt, whose failure has been already fully reported, appeared for his adjourned public examination. The Official Receiver, Mr. G. Philpott, observed that he was in correspondence with the bankrupt's solicitors upon certain matters, and for the present he was not "prepared to resume the examination." He suggested a further examination. The Registrar consented, and an order to that effect was accordingly made.

BUTLER, EDWARD and NOAH, coach, cart, and van builders, Buckingham Road, Harlesden, trading as Butler Bros.—These bankrupts attended on Wednesday week the sitting of the Court before Mr. Registrar Giffard, and, after having been examined by Mr. Grey, Assistant Official Receiver, they were allowed to pass their public examination, upon accounts showing debts £144 0s. 11d., and assets £39 6s.

BUTSON, H. R., builder, 60, Swinton Street, W.C.—The failure of this debtor has been announced, a receiving order having been made against him upon a creditor's petition. The debtor appears to have carried on business at 49, Southampton Row, Holborn, until last January, when he sold it for £150 to Messrs. Vigor & Co. The proceeds were devoted to paying off rent and rates; and the debtor further states that the furniture is the separate property of his wife. The amount of liabilities did not transpire.

FOSTER, H. & A.—With reference to the list of creditors published in last week's Journal, we understand that Mr. L. Bamberger is a creditor for £192 4s. for his own account, and £52 6s. 6d. for the account of a firm for which he is agent—not £341 as reported. Messrs. May & Hassell inform us that the amount which they proved for was £430.

GOULD, WILLIAM KNAPTON, builder, 47, Kenwyn Road, High Street, Clapham.—The first meeting of the creditors interested herein took place on Wednesday week at the offices of the Official Receiver for the Wandsworth District, 24, Railway Approach, London, S.E. The debtor's summary of accounts disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £3,959 4s. 9d., of which £917 16s. 10d. was due to unsecured creditors. The assets are £300 2s. 1d., and which, after deducting the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaves net assets at £281 12s. 7d., and a deficiency amounting to £636 4s. 3d. The receiving order was made on the petition of a creditor on May 21st, 1891. An order for summary administration was made on May 26th, 1891, and the debtor was adjudicated bankrupt the same day. The bankrupt was formerly a carpenter, and in March, 1889, he commenced trading on his own account as a carpenter and builder in the Kenwyn Road, Clapham. This deficiency account is obviously incorrect. Mr. J. G. Gibson, Assistant Official Receiver, who presided at the meeting, stated that only one proof had been received in time for voting purposes. The debtor's examination had been fixed for June 9th inst., but owing to the meeting of creditors not having been held it was ordered to be adjourned. A creditor remarked that at a private meeting of the debtor's creditors held a short time ago he offered a composition of 10s. in the pound, but he had paid a portion of the composition to some of the creditors and nothing to others. He had also given preference by assigning some property to creditors. In reply to questions the debtor admitted he had paid 2s. 6d. in the pound to some of his creditors and 1s. in the pound to others. His reason for so doing was because he thought they would sue him for the full amount. These creditors had not given a receipt in full.

discharge of their debts, but simply a receipt on account. The debtor denied making an assignment because he could give no guarantee for the payment of the composition. The meeting of creditors was adjourned, and at the adjourned meeting he was authorised to collect the rents and divide the money equally among the creditors. The composition was to have been paid in four instalments, viz., at Christmas, 1890, and Midsummer, Michaelmas, and Christmas, 1891. The petition was filed on the petition of one of his creditors, the act of bankruptcy being the dishonouring of bills and failing to comply with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice, which was served upon him after a writ had been issued. The adjourned meeting of the creditors was held on December 2nd, and the first meeting was held about a month previous to that, but he could not say when the bankruptcy notice was served upon him. He was defeated in paying the composition instalments owing to his tenants not paying their rents. He paid some of the creditors since the private meeting, but he had paid no dividend for most of them. He usually obtained credit from three to four months' credit from the timber merchants. He did not think they charged him more for timber, through his being a speculative builder, than they would anyone else; however, it was possible that builders in a large way, who have charged quantities at a time, might get it a little cheaper. As there were not enough creditors present to form a quorum, no resolutions could be passed, therefore it was decided to leave the matter in the hands of the Official Receiver, to be wound up in the usual way.

JERRARD, MICHAEL, builder, Salisbury. —The summary of debtor's statement of affairs shows liabilities amounting to £4,277 which is expected to rank £1,042 3s., and assets £542 8s., deficiency £499 15s. The debtor alleges that his insolvency was caused chiefly in consequence of some of his building contracts and some of his speculations entered into by the late firm of Jerrard & Stephens proving unremunerative. The Official Receiver's observations were : The receiving order was made on the petition of the debtor himself. It would appear that he commenced business in March 1884, in partnership with Charles Stephens, trading under the style of Jerrard & Stephens, as builders, and continued up till last March, when the partnership was dissolved. The bankrupt states that in the first place they were speculative builders, but subsequently undertook contracts. I understand that the agreement dissolving the partnership provided that Stephens should assign to the debtor his interest (subject to the mortgages) in the various properties then belonging to them, and the debtor was to pay the liabilities of the firm. He informed me that Stephens kept the books in connection with the firm, and at that time stated the liabilities amounted to about £350, but he has since discovered they amounted to about £1,000. It is true that the assets are estimated to realise the sum of £566 16s. 8d., but from experience gained in winding up similar estates I am of opinion that the equities of redemption will produce a very much less sum than the figure appearing on the asset side of the statement. No cash book seems to have been kept, and from information given me by the debtor it appears the accounts kept were very imperfect and only in memorandum books. It seems that the partners of the late firm knew that they had
