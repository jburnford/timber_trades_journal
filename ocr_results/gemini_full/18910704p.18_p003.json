R. Thorpe), St. Peter's Church Walk, Nottingham.\nThe summary of debtor's statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £2,159 11s. 8d., but only £172 owing to unsecured creditors were returned as expected to rank against the estate for dividend.\nThere were creditors fully secured for £47,410, the estimated value of their securities being £47,410, leaving a surplus of £240, which, together with £16 11s. 8d., book debts, made the total assets £256 11s. 8d.\nAfter allowing for payment of debts due to the unsecured creditors, there would remain, according to the statement of £84 11s. 8d.\nThe causes of failure alleged by the debtor were \"bad trade, want of capital, and thorough depreciation in value of property and losses sustained in connection with Gilbert & Gilbert's failure.\"\nThe Official Receiver's observations on the case were as follows:- \"The receiving order was made on the debtor's petition.\nThe debtor, who is now working as a journeyman joiner in Manchester, states that he commenced business in partnership with two firm of builders in Nottingham in 1883, and that he put £250 into the business.\nIt appears to have engaged largely in building operations, and at the dissolution of the partnership in 1885 the partnership assets included a large number of houses, shops, and business premises in Nottingham and the immediate neighbourhood.\nIn 1884, prior to the dissolution, I am informed that two of the partners conveyed the above property to the third.\nImported Teak Planks, in all thicknesses and widths, are sold by Hoar & Brown, Teak Wharf, West India Docks, E., and at Hornbeam, London.\nTelephone [?]",
