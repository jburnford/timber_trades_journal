FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes to the full amount.]
ASHLING, WILLIAM TRUSLOVE,
neyman joiner, 133, Emden Street, and lately residing at Seymour Street, both at Long Hedge Lane, Nottingham, joiner and builder.
A first meeting of the creditors of the debtor, against whom a receiving order was made on the 9th inst., was held on Tuesday at the offices of the Official Receiver (Mr. E. R. Thorpe), St. Peter's Church Walk, Nottingham.
The summary of debtor's statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £2,159 11s. 8d., but only £172 owing to unsecured creditors were returned as expected to rank against the estate for dividend.
There were creditors fully secured for £47,410, the estimated value of their securities being £47,410, leaving a surplus of £240, which, together with £16 11s. 8d., book debts, made the total assets £256 11s. 8d.
After allowing for payment of debts due to the unsecured creditors, there would remain, according to the statement of £84 11s. 8d.
The causes of failure alleged by the debtor were "bad trade, want of capital, and thorough depreciation in value of property and losses sustained in connection with Gilbert & Gilbert's failure."
The Official Receiver's observations on the case were as follows:- "The receiving order was made on the debtor's petition.
The debtor, who is now working as a journeyman joiner in Manchester, states that he commenced business in partnership with two firm of builders in Nottingham in 1883, and that he put £250 into the business.
It appears to have engaged largely in building operations, and at the dissolution of the partnership in 1885 the partnership assets included a large number of houses, shops, and business premises in Nottingham and the immediate neighbourhood.
In 1884, prior to the dissolution, I am informed that two of the partners conveyed the above property to the third.
Imported Teak Planks, in all thicknesses and widths, are sold by Hoar & Brown, Teak Wharf, West India Docks, E., and at Hornbeam, London.
