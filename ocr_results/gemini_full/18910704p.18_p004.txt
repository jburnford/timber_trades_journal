ASHLING, WILLIAM TRUSTON, jour-neyman joiner, 133, Emden Street, Manchester, lately residing at Seymour Street, and trading at Long Hedge Lane, Nottingham, as a joiner and builder. A first meeting of the creditors of the debtor, against whom a receiving order was made on the 9th inst., was held on Tuesday at the offices of the Official Receiver (Mr. H. R. Thorpe), St. Peter's Church Walk, Notting-ham. The summary of debtor's statement of affairs showed gross liabilities of £47,582, but only £172 owing to unsecured creditors were returned as expected to rank against the estate for dividend. There were creditors given as fully secured for £47,410, the estimated value of their securities being £47,650, leaving a surplus of £240, which, together with £16 11s. 8d., book debts, made the total estimated assets £256 11s. 8d. After allowing for the payment of debts due to the unsecured creditors there would remain, according to this, a surplus of £84 11s. 8d. The causes of failure as alleged by the debtor were "bad trade, want of capital, and thorough depreciation in value of property, and losses sustained in connection with the late Mr. Mark Gilbert's failure." The Official Receiver's observations on the case were as fol-lows :— "The receiving order was made on the debtor's petition. The debtor, who is now working as a journeyman joiner in Manchester, states he commenced business in partnership with a firm of builders in Nottingham in 1874, and that he put £250 into the business. This firm appears to have engaged largely in building operations, and at the dissolution of the partnership in 1885 the partnership property included a large number of houses, shops, and business premises in Nottingham and the im-mediate neighbourhood. In 1884, prior to the dissolution, I am informed that the three partners conveyed the above properties to the late Mr. Mark Gilbert (of the firm of Towle & Gilbert), subject to existing mortgages, as a trustee for the purpose of management and division, and that it was provided that each partner should receive a sum of £250 a year out of the net income of the partnership pro-perty, which it was expected would yield, after payment of interest on mortgages and expenses of collection and management, more than sufficient for this purpose. The debtor states he received £250 per annum for about a year and a half, and his late partners received a similar amount. After this all payment from the rental of the partnership property was discontinued, owing partly to depreciation in the properties, and partly (as the debtor alleges) to the involved position of Messrs. Towle & Gilbert's affairs. The debtor is jointly and severally liable with his late partners for the mortgages existing on the properties referred to, which consist of about 270 dwelling-houses, including some shops, a brickyard, and other business premises in various parts of Notting-ham and neighbourhood. The debtor's interest in any surplus from these securities is limited to one-third. These properties are set down in the statement of affairs as of the estimated value of £47,100. The mortgages and charges to which they are subject are stated at £43,744, on a portion of which the interest is in arrear. Some of these mortgages extend by way of covering security over a large portion of the properties. These and other liabilities being deducted from the value of the property leave, as the debtor estimates, a surplus to his estate of £220. This surplus depending upon the realisation of so large an amount of property is obviously a very doubtful and unreliable asset. The debtor is possessed of a dwelling-house in Seymour Street, Nottingham, which is mortgaged for £530. He estimates the value of this property at £550, leaving a surplus of £20, but this apparently allows nothing for the expenses of realising the property. The surplus from real estate and a book debt of £16 11s. 8d. constitute the whole of the debtor's estate. The debtor states that he has not been a housekeeper since February, 1890, and has had no furniture since that time, when he transferred it to his daughter as part payment of moneys owing by him to her. I am making inquiry into this statement. As the debtor shows a nominal surplus, he has lodged no deficiency account." Mr. Briggs appeared for the debtor. There was not a quorum of credi-tors present or represented, and no resolution was passed, an order for the summary adminis-tration of the estate having already been made.

The statement of affairs showed the gross lia-bilities to be £37,582 2s. 4d., £11,010 0s. 1d. being for unsecured creditors, £26,301 10s. 3d. for creditors fully secured, and £222 12s. for creditors for rates, taxes, wages, &c. Of this amount £12,752 0s. 1d. was expected to rank against the estate, towards which assets were estimated as follows:—Cash in hand, £523 10s. 9d.; stock-in-trade, £2,500; machinery and loose plant, £400; rolling stock, £200; fire appliances, £20; good book debts, £5,838 15s. 6d.; bad and doubtful book debts, £1,686 12s. 9d., estimated to produce £173 2s.; bills of exchange or similar securities estimated to produce £999 7s. 6d.; total, £10,654 15s. 9d., from which £222 12s. had to be deducted for creditors for rent, rates, wages, &c., leaving the available assets £10,432 3s. 9d., and a deficiency of £2,319 16s. 4d. The debtor is abroad, and has not been examined. The observations of the Nottingham Official Receiver were as fol-lows :— "The receiving order was made on the 10th inst., on a creditor's petition, founded on notice of suspension of payment, against W. A. Hardy & Co., of Parkinson Street, Not-tingham, timber merchants and saw-mill pro-prietors. The firm appears to consist solely of who is and for a long time has been living abroad. The business has been carried on under the superintendence and management of Mr. J. S. Hardy, acting under power of attorney granted to him by W. A. Hardy. Mr. J. S. Hardy is dangerously ill, and quite incapable of giving assistance or information on business matters. Under these circumstances there is no responsible person who can be called upon to furnish a statement of affairs. I have requested Messrs. E. P. Steeds & Wright, chartered accountants of Nottingham and Leicester, to prepare a statement of assets and liabilities which I can lay before the creditors with the notice con-vening the first meeting. This has been done as far as was practicable, and I have no doubt the figures may be accepted as approximately correct, subject to the following observations:—Stock-in-trade, £2,500—Messrs. E. P. Steeds & Wright inform me that they have arrived at this figure by taking the amount shown on a stock taking which appears to have been made on the 9th May last for a creditors' meeting or some other business purpose, and by adding to and deducting from it the amount of pur-chases and sales which have been made since that day; machinery (live and dead), £400; rolling stock £200, are estimates which have been made with the assistance of the persons engaged in the department of the business to which they relate. The list of creditors fully secured amounts to £26,301 10s. 3d., against which are to be set properties in Fox Road, Millicent Road, and Henry Road, West Bridgford; Park Street, Carlton; Goodhead Street, Parkin Street, Canterbury Road, Charnwood Grove, and Dorset Street, Notting-ham; and also property at Burton Joyce and Buxton. Some of this property is freehold and some of it leasehold. I cannot procure particulars and valuations of these properties without going to considerable expense, which, as no offer of composition is likely to be made, it does not seem desirable, at least at present, to incur. Unless the unsecured creditors are largely increased by the insufficiency of the freehold and leasehold properties to answer the charges upon them, it will be seen that the assets justify a reasonable expectation of a substantial dividend. At the making of the receiving order there was a quantity of stock of manufacture, and it was repre-sented to me that unless the orders on hand were filled, countermands would be speedily sent in and the estate would be fixed with a quantity of unfinished goods, which could only be disposed of at a serious loss. There was also the probability of claims for breach of contract being made against the estate. Under these circumstances, and on the appli-cation of the local creditors, I have continued the business, and have appointed Mr. James Neville Thompson, who has been many years in the employ of the firm, special manager to superintend the business with a view to work-ing out the orders on hand, which will probably carry the business on until the first meeting." A proof by Mr. W. J. Scott, of Birmingham, for £20,000 was rejected for voting purposes, because the proof did not show to whom the money was ad-vanced. The proof of Mary Hardy, as executrix of the estate of John Hardy, was also the subject of some discussion.
