AN ANCIENT DWELLING-HOUSE.—The oldest timbered house known to exist in Colchester was destroyed last week to make room for the gable end of a new clothing factory in Stanwell Street. The house was composed of a complete framework of chestnut or oak, accurately morticed and tenoned together, and secured by oak pins like a timber-built ship. The spaces between the timbers in the walls and partitions were filled in with hazel sticks with the bark on, and embedded in a mixture of clay and gravel, faced with lime and hair plaster. Although the house is believed to have been standing for 500 years, its materials were in excellent preservation, and a dozen labourers, worked hard for four days with cart ropes, crowbars, hammers, and saws before the demolition of this small but sturdy building was completed.
TREES IN LONDON.—Dr. W. T. Greene writes to a contemporary:—"The London County Council has done good work since its formation, and notably when it granted a sum of money for the extension of Peckham Rye Common, but it certainly did a very bad day's work when it began to cut and hack the trees on the common. Many cartloads of branches have been cut out of fine young trees, which are consequently ruined as to shape, and necessarily weakened by having so many leaves removed during the active period of growth. These trees were making splendid growth, and promised in a few years to be real ornaments to the place, but their usefulness is quite marred, and in the eye of all lovers of nature they are now as unsightly as they were beautiful before this barbarous and uncalled for mutilation, for even granting that it was necessary to lop them, which it was not, the season of growth is surely not the time to do it, when the sap is flowing and every cut branch bleeds".

BILLINS, JOSE EDWARD, builder, Hanworth Road, Hounslow, Middlesex.—The statutory meeting of the creditors herein was held at the offices of the Official Receiver for the Brentford district, Temple Chambers, E C., on Thursday week. The statement of affairs disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £1,800 19s. 3d., of which £785 4s. 7d. was due to unsecured creditors. The assets amount to £54 14s 7d, and after deducting £10 1s. 8d for the claims of preferential creditors leaves net assets at £46 19s. 11d., and discloses a deficiency amounting to £838 4s. 8d. The report and observations of the Official Receiver were to the following effect:—The receiving order was made on June 24th, 1891, on the petition of Messrs. James & Co., timber merchants, of Brentford. The debtor commenced business as a builder, about twenty years ago, in Fulham, with a small capital. He traded in Fulham for six years, during which time he had contracts for the building of cottage property. From Fulham the debtor moved to Hounslow, and for a short period acted as foreman to a Mr. Priddle, builder. He has built about twenty-nine cottages, but has been jobbing work. The Assistant Official Receiver, Mr. Shirtcliffe, who presided at the meeting, stated that only four proofs had been admitted, and the debtor had been adjudicated bankrupt, and a summary administration order made. He could not understand why the debtor did not attend the meeting, as he had been ordered to do so. However, he had no offer of composition to make. The debts realised £18 1s 6d., which was considerably more than the debtor had estimated. The properties had been sold at a great sacrifice, twice that amount to build. He understood that the bankrupt had been pressed by several other creditors besides the petitioning creditors. The debtor had had two fires within the past twelve months, over which he made a considerable loss, as the insurance company refused to pay the value of a large quantity of doors which he had in stock at the time. Eventually it was decided to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver, to be dealt with in the usual way.
BUTT, EDWARD, builder, 225, Hythe Park Road, Leeds.—The statement of affairs under this recent failure shows gross liabilities amounting to £1,161 5s. 5d., of which £186 5s. 5d. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend, and assets estimated at £125, or a deficiency of £11 5s. 5d. The following are scheduled as creditors :—

CAPSEY, HENRY, builder, 366, Romford Road, Stratford, E.—A first meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Monday week before Mr. Wreford.
