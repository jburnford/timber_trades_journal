THE RUSSIAN PORTS —The Russian Government is endeavouring to cultivate the trade and develop the natural resources of the country in every direction. This is especially the case as regards the commercial ports of the empire, which are being organised and improved under the management of a special commission appointed by the Minister of Ways and Communications.
The importance of the harbour improvements at Tampico is attested by the action of the steam lines in establishing local agencies and in preparing additional wharfage facilities. The lines now calling regularly at Tampico are as follows :—Harrison Line, West India and Pacific, French Commercial Line, American Packet Company, New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company, Compania Transatlantica Española, and Vapores del Golfo Mexicano. These lines sail from New York, New Orleans, Galveston, Liverpool, Hamburg, Antwerp, Bordeaux, Havre, Marseilles, Barcelona, Havana, Progreso, and Vera Cruz. Three additional steamship lines are preparing vessels for Tampico service.
