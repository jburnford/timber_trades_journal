WORK IN THE WOODS IN JULY.—Pruning is a proper operation during the present month, says the *North British Agriculturist*.
Shoots which, by their excessive vigour, threaten to upset the balance of the tree should be shortened; all such as bear too great a proportion to the main stem maybe suspected of doing harm, and ought to be cut back, more or less, according to their strength.
Summer pruning is not generally practised on agricultural and woodland hedges, but its advantages are by all who do practise it.
By removing the strong growth from the upper half of the hedge at the present time, the sap is diverted to the weaker parts below, with the result of strengthening them.
Look over young plantations, and clear away all rank vegetation that is likely to injure or overpower the young trees.
In the nursery the principal business of this month will be the keeping down the weeds.
If the buds of variegated trees, such as acers, ash, and elm, and such like ornamental subjects, revert to the gold tree, such as the purple beech, this is a good time to have it done.

ABERDEEN MECHANICAL SOCIETY.
The Aberdeen Mechanical Society has made its third summer excursion to inspect the system of heating and ventilating as now adopted by the Aberdeen School Board.
The members assembled at the Middle School, Gallowgate, and were met by Mr. Crichton and Mr. Smith, president of the society.
They first led the party through the eastern division of the school, carefully observing the action of the air currents from the fresh air inlets to the outlets in the various class-rooms.
So thoroughly is the ventilation being carried out that in every seven-and-a-half minutes the whole school, of 1,164 places of ten cubic feet, is replenished with fresh air.
Having reached the top floor, the automatic action of the india-rubber luffers for the exit of the foul air, and also preventing a down-draught by the luffer closing to the wind pressure and opening on the opposite side to give a full outlet, was explained.
The gymnasium was next visited, together with its accessories—the cooking class-room; then came the workshop in which the School Board intend to commence manual instruction, with its carpenters’ benches and tools for twelve or fourteen boys at a time.
A descent was then made down the western division, the party making an examination of the school furniture and apparatus, all of the most improved type, giving ease and comfort to the pupils while engaged in their work.
Passing underground, the furnace-room was next visited, and the whole system of heating was inspected.
The whole heating and ventilating arrangement was in excellent and efficient working condition.
The members next visited the King Street School to examine “Key’s” silent exhaust-box for gas engines.
It prevents the rapid corrosion of iron pipes, and from the products of combustion discharged from the engine cylinders the carbonic acid gas is removed and the efficiency of the engine is increased.
The engine at this school is a 3½ horse-power horizontal “Otto.”
The propeller, 4 ft. diameter, makes 500 revolutions per minute, and moves 25,000 cubic feet of air.
With the new exhaust-box the consumption has been reduced to thirty-six cubic feet per hour, the engine is said to be more easily started, and the exhaust is quite silent.
All present considered the arrangements as giving satisfactory results.

factory results.
After visiting several of the class-rooms, the party united in according their thanks to Mr. Crichton for the trouble he had taken, and the information he had given, while showing them round the schools, also to Mr. Hector and the School Board for their kindness in granting permission.
The next visit is to Gordon's Mills Paper Works on the 1st August.

FATAL ACCIDENT IN AN ABERDEEN GRANITE QUARRY.—The recent heavy rains caused a serious subsidence at Rubislaw quarry, near Aberdeen, by which the death of one of the workmen, Alexander Fyfe, was employed on the top of a bank, when the earth, swollen with the rain, gave way, and Fyfe was precipitated to the bottom of the quarry.
The depth was about 180 ft.
Death, of course, was instantaneous.

SHIP CARPENTRY AND SHIP JOINERY.—The City and Guilds of London Institute has, through its superintendent of examinations, Sir Philip Magnus, sent to the secretary of Robert Gordon's College, Aberdeen—Mr. Fotheringham—copies of a syllabus of examinations in the subjects of “Ship Carpentry” and “Ship Joinery,” which will appear for the first time in the Institute’s programme of examinations for the ensuing session.
This early intimation is made with the view of affording those who may wish to present themselves for examination—artisans engaged in the shipbuilding industry and others—time to make the necessary arrangements.
Having regard to the great influence which the City and Guilds of London Institute has exerted in devoloping technical education throughout the country, the announcement that these subjects, which occupy such an important place among Scottish industries, are now to be included in the Institute's programme of examinations, will no doubt be hailed with satisfaction, and it is hoped this will be the means of forming in Aberdeen a contingent of artisans from our shipbuilding yards, able to give a good account of themselves in the examinations which are now to be held thoroughly inaugurated.
The examinations will be held in Aberdeen in May, 1892.
