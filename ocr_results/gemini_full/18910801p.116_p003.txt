FOSTER, JOHN GODWIN, of Taunton Road, St. Andrew's, Bristol, carrying on business at Montpelier railway station and Mina Road, and at Cheltenham, as a coal merchant and brick and tile manufacturer.-On Friday at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court Mr. Sibly applied for the bankrupt's discharge. He said the petition was filed in August, 1884, and there was an adjudication following, and that the public examination was closed on October 10th. The only point in the report of the Official Receiver was that the debtor had once before become a bankrupt. His Honour: How long ago? Mr. Sibly: In 1884, when he paid a composition of 8s. The cause of the present failure was that debtor embarked in business without capital, he made bad debts, and one of his collectors embezzled a large sum of money. The Official Receiver said he had not discovered anything serious in the affairs of the debtor, whose present position was a misfortune. He knew nothing of the former bankruptcy. The judge directed that the debtor receive his discharge in three months.
HARDY, JOHN, carpenter, joiner, and builder, Blackwood, Mon.-The statement of affairs filed herein shows liabilities to unsecured creditors of £721 6s.; creditors fully secured, £45; estimated value of securities, £100; creditors partly secured, £100; estimated value of securities, £8 11s.; to rank, £91 9s.; total, £812 15s. The assets are returned at £58 0s. 9d.; deficiency, £754 14s. 3d., accounted for by excess of liabilities over assets, on the 10th day of July, 1890, £290 8s. 7d. for carrying on business from the 10th July, 1890, to date of receiving order, £180; bad debts, £22 5s. 8d.; household expenses, £70; loss on contract, £60. The debtor alleges the causes of his failure to be loss on bad debts, advance in wages and materials, and competition in trade. The debtor commenced business about twenty years ago with a capital of £60, and he has kept a rough day book as well as a pocket book and a cost book. He also stated that he became aware of his insolvency three years ago, and that he has made a profit, although his household and personal expenses have amounted to between 45s. and 50s. weekly.

MYLES, STEPHEN, builder, Eastwell.-The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Tuesday at the offices of the Official Receiver for the London proach, London Bridge under the presidency of Mr. 'Cully, Official Receiver for the Brighton district. The debtor's statement of accounts disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £3,982 6s. 11d., of which £2,766 was due to unsecured creditors, the balance being for creditors fully secured, £1,216 5s., securities being estimated at £1,216 5s., thus stowing a surplus of £100 to meet the contra. The assets are set down as follows:-trade cost £40, estimated to produce £20; trade fixtures, fittings, &c., £10; book debts, good, £20; bad, £20; securities in the hands of secured creditors £400; total assets £490. After deducting £7 15s. for preferential creditors there remains net assets at £446 1s. 1d., thus showing a deficiency amounting to £2,320 4s. 11d. The report and observations of the Official Receiver are as follows:-The receiving order was made on June 1st, 1891, on the debtor's petition, the act of bankruptcy being non-compliance with a bankruptcy notice. An order appealed to that order of adjudication was dismissed. The debtor states that he was in partnership with a Mr. James, at Croydon, where they engaged in building operations. That resulted in a private arrangement, and when the creditors then released the debtor, the liabilities then being about £1,000. He then continued to build on his own account at Croydon, East Dulwich, and Norwood, and in 1885, he was again in difficulties, and at a private meeting of creditors a pound was made, which was afterwards sold up his property. He then went to Australia, but returned in 1888, when he commenced building operations at Seaford, most of the property being sold to the mortgagees. In February last the debtor removed to Seaford, when he states that Mr. James took land on building lease, and that he (debtor) acted as his manager, receiving a salary of 40s. per week, and that the parties have been building together under the name of James's nominees. The debtor, who, he states, has no interest in the mortgages are now being foreclosed, and from securities is the debtor's interest in six houses in Chichester Road, Seaford, which are unfinished, and of which he is in possession. Of the unsecured creditors, liabilities to the amount of £1,000 appears to have been contracted...
