The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT

25 fathoms firewood, 601 rickers, 1,000 pieces lathwood, and 32,228 deals and battens ex *Petersburg* (a), from Cronstadt; and 6,000 oak staves ex *Critic* (a), from New York, and 87 pieces hickory ex *Dracona*, (s), from Montreal.
There are also two small cargoes of firewood, viz., 74 fathoms per *Poseidon*, from Skien, for Mr. M. J. Ellingsen, and 52½ fathoms per *Saphir*, from Messrs C. Salvesen & Co., Christiansand, for Messrs. D. W. Beattie, at the Edinburgh Dock, south.
There has been more doing this week, although the unsettled wet weather has been against outdoor work.
The public sale on Tuesday, 4th inst., by Mr. D. W. Beattie, at the Edinburgh Dock, south, suffered from the heavy rain, which fell all the afternoon, and although the choice of Archangel, Petersburg and Swedish deals and battens offered, the amount of business done was disappointingly small.
So far as prices were concerned, there was not much reason to complain, recent rates being fully maintained.

AUGUST 8, 1891.

DEER FORESTS.—The Assessors of Lands and Heritages have been called upon by Mr. J. Auldjo Jamieson, Crown agent for Scotland, to make up a return relating to deer forests in their districts.
The particulars required to be given are the name of the forest, county in which situated, proprietor, estimated extent, whether formed since 1883, greatest altitude above sea level in feet, rental prior to afforestment, and present rental.
The return for the whole of Scotland is, it is understood, when completed, to be laid before Parliament.

CATALOGUES RECEIVED.—We have received from the well-known engineering firm, John McDowall & Sons, Johnstone, a copy of the tenth edition of their catalogue of wood-working machinery.
This is a most interesting and instructive handbook to the saw-mill trade.
The recommendations and instructions contained in the work are exceedingly valuable, and coming from a source so competent, from the long practical experience the firm have had in all branches of their business in every country of the world, they will no doubt receive that perusal at the hands of those engaged in saw-mill work which it deserves.
It is profusely illustrated, every variety of saw-mill machinery being represented by drawings, no less than 160 varieties of machines being shown in this way to suit the requirements of saw-millers, shipbuilders, cabinet-makers, joiners, &c., &c.
The whole is so well indexed and arranged that no difficulty is experienced in reference, and each machine so minutely described that at a glance may be judged the best to suit conditions of work, position, or other peculiarities.
The testimonials attached to the large number of machines from the leading timber firms, not only of Great Britain but from abroad, makes it superfluous for us to refer to the high reputation the firm have acquired for themselves in this branch of industry, and which they sustain.
Their recent ingenious improvements in the details of the older classes of machines for increased production of work by more economical methods, and the several new machines which they have recently brought out in several departments, show that they are determined to keep themselves to the front in the manufacture of wood-working machinery.
We commend this edition of their catalogue, which is a work of art, to the study of all in any way interested in the manufacture of timber.

MR. DAVID WIGHT,
OF IRELAND & THORNLEY, LEITH.
It is appropriate that in the issue of the week so largely devoted to the interests and study of arboriculture, that of a representative gentleman associated with this department should be the subject of our sketch, Mr. Wight is not an arboricultural artist in the ordinary sense, but who, it may be said, was born and bred in it.
The name of Wight is familiarly known in p[?]
