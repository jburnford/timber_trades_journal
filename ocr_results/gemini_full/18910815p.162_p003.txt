FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ANDREWS, EPHRAIM, coachbuilder, Sudbury.—A first meeting of creditors in this bankruptcy was held before Mr. F. Messent, Official Receiver, at the Townhall, Colchester, on the 5th inst. The debtor's statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £1,784 4s. 3d., of which £1,047 18s. 3d. is expected to rank for dividend. The unsecured creditors amount to £737 18s. 3d. The assets are put down at £709 14s. The unsecured creditors include the following timber merchants :-
... £ s. d.
Clark T. & Co., Earls Colne ... ... ... 6 13 2
Hopton & Son, London... ... ... ... 6 15 6
Hunter & Co., Shoreditch ... ... ... 14 5 10
Owen Joseph & Son, Liverpool ... ... 5 5 1
The debtor commenced business as a coachbuilder, about twenty-two years ago, without any capital of his own, but his father supplied him with some cash at that time, and has since, at various times, rendered him further financial assistance. For some years the business appears to have been carried on at the Market Hill, Sudbury, but about three years ago the debtor purchased the premises he now occupies, and removed his business to Sepulchre Street. The debtor has never taken stock or prepared any balance-sheet, and although at times his stock in-trade book appears to have been kept, this has been allowed to lapse for several years past. The debtor is unable to say what capital he had three years ago, or to show that he was solvent at that time, but he states that he did not realise that he had not sufficient assets to pay all his debts in full until quite recently. With regard to his assets, it is feared it will be found that the stock-in-trade are both returned at sums far in excess of the amounts they will realise. The debtor states the cause of his insolvency is the losses sustained by a fire on his premises which occurred some years ago, which he estimates at £150, and the only particular losses shown in his deficiency account are "bad debts, £35." After some conversation, Mr. E. C. Binstaad, accountant, of Finsbury Pavement, was appointed trustee, and the following were appointed a committee of inspection :-Messrs. G. D. Norrington, London; Geo. Grimwood, Sudbury; and R. Mattingly, Sudbury.

Henley & Co., builders, Croydon.—At the Croydon Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week Mr. Henley & Co., builders, was represented by a solicitor, who applied for an adjournment of the case. He appeared, he said, for the petitioning creditors. The assets disclosed were practically nil; but he had obtained from third parties an offer which would pay the creditors 10s. in the pound, which they were anxious to accept. He communicated with the Official Receiver, who said he would not take less than 20s. in the pound. The Official Receiver: The offer was contingent upon certain proceedings not being inquired into. The Registrar: Then I am perfectly sure you would not agree to it. Official Receiver: Even supposing there had been an offer of 20s. in the pound it would still be my duty to inquire into the conduct of the bankrupt. As to the offer made, it was for me to say that it was for 10s. in the pound. It was an offer of a lump sum of £150, made conditionally upon certain investigations which it would be his duty to make not being made. The Registrar (to creditor's solicitor): Do you think you can get a better offer if the matter is adjourned? The solicitor: Yes, I think I may. The Official Receiver: I have no objection to an adjournment to look after the interests of the creditors. I have also to see that nothing against public policy takes place. The adjournment was granted.
HOOKWAY, R. T., builder and contractor, Bideford.—The adjourned first meeting of creditors has been held at Barnstaple, before the Official Receiver (Mr. George Philpott), who reported the latter to communicate with the Board of Trade with reference to a proof of the Devon and Cornwall Banking Company for £1,000. The Official Receiver now stated that he had decided to admit the proof for voting purposes, but it would be fought out in court. Mr. Oerton, solicitor for the debtor, said his client only owed the bank £700, and stated that the ment they had obtained for £1,000 had been snatched. Mr. G. O. Peard (for the bank) entirely denied this, but the Official Receiver stopped the discussion at once. The matter was resolved upon, with Mr. Sanders, solicitor, of Barnstaple, as trustee, with a committee of inspection.

HOWARD, THOMAS, joiner and builder, Goodwin Square, Rochdale Road, Manchester, and residing at Wood Street, Heywood, late Moldgreen, Huddersfield.—Deed of assignment for benefit of creditors. Trustee, Mr. C. T. Nicholson, Manchester (Chartered Accountant), with a committee of inspection. Dated 10th August, 1891. Filed 10th August, 1891. Unsecured liabilities £286 17s. 2d., estimated net assets £156. The following are scheduled

JOHNSON, FREDERIC, joiner, 14, Hill Road, Walthamstow.—A receiving order was made in this case on 28th July. A summary of the accounts has been issued. The liabilities amount to £1,223 15s., of which £1,154 2s. 11d. expected to rank. The assets are estimated at £278 1s. The debtor states that he commenced business in 1878 as a builder about seventeen years ago, without any capital, at Brixton, subsequently removing on at Walthamstow, and that in 1888 he made a private arrangement with his creditors (under which he paid them 20s. in the pound), and continued his business, removing his building at Enfield Highway, Middlesex. Down to the date of the receiving order the debtor attributes his insolvency to the severe winter which caused a great depression in the building trade, and to his expenses having been in excess of his income. The Official Receiver states that the books produced by the debtor are very incomplete and imperfect, and that the list of secured creditors appears to be incorrect in respect of trade debts and losses in building speculations. The debtor has been adjudged bankrupt, and has not submitted any proposal.
MARTIN, EMMA, builder, Pousharding, Budock.—The debtor was intended at the Truro Bankruptcy Court on Saturday, before Mr. F. H. Cock, Registrar, his adjourned public examination. The debtor stated that he had filed a statement of his transactions for the past three years, and he admitted that the amounts were only estimates. The cash book, which showed the receipts and payments from the 1st of January, 1886, was begun by him about ten months ago, and it was written up by his daughter for the recent proceedings for possession. He could not explain how the balance of £349 7s. 11d. shown in his books unexplained in the statement. The Official Receiver said he was not satisfied with the accounts, and it was very important that they should ascertain for what purpose the cash for disposal of the balance had been used. The Registrar asked whether the debtor's two daughters were alleged to have received £100 each from their uncle. The debtor's solicitor said yes, and he could call the daughters in examination being closed. A good deal of elucidation was given to the matter, but it had gone to. Mr. W. Jenkins, for the debtor, his client had given all the information he possibly could, but he admitted that the matter was very unsatisfactory, and the examination would be adjourned for a month.
MERRYWEATHER, GEORGE. This bankrupt, whose failure has already been reported, again surrendered for examination on Thames Bankrupts, and was further his public examination was concluded, and questioned by a creditor.
