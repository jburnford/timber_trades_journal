Sandison\n\nINTERESTING FOSSIL.—The other morning the navvies working at the deep cutting of the Crieff and Comrie Railway, at the west side of the town, came upon a curious stone lying about 8 ft. below the surface of the ground. On examination, it seemed to have been a root-cutting of a tree nearly a foot in length, having a diameter at the lower end of 7 in., and at the top of 5 in. The lower end appears as if cut with an axe or some such instrument, and the top has every appearance of being cut with a saw, and is quite smooth. The yearly growths are distinctly visible at the smooth end. An experienced wood merchant is of opinion that it is the cutting of a laburnum tree, and is much heavier than a stone of the same size.\n\nTHE VENTILATION OF THE ABERDEEN PUBLIC LIBRARY.—The operations in connection with the introduction to the new Free Public Library, of Keys' mechanical system of ventilation are being proceeded with. It will be necessary to excavate to a depth of two or three ft., under the caretaker's house, and to raise the floors of the dwelling-house two ft. The furnace room will contain two fire brick furnaces, each with seven boilers; and it is intended to use only one of the boilers in moderately cold winter weather, reserving the others for more severe weather. In heating the air to the required temperature fourteen coils of tubing of one inch bore, embracing about 4,000 lineal ft. of piping, will be used. The washing screen will occupy a space from floor to ceiling of fourteen ft. by seven ft. It will be double, and kept moist by water issuing from an overhead three-quarter inch copper tube. The air will be drawn in to the building by a Blackman propeller driven by a four horse-power gas engine. The main air delivery ducts, three in number, each six ft. wide. by four ft. high; will be formed by the dwarf walls carrying the floor joists of the lending library, and the outlets for air, from the three library halls, will be by large gratings (eight for each hall) in the base of each pilaster. The exhaust air will be conducted in wooden ducts to a large ventilator of artistic design on the ridge of the front part of the roof of the library. With the engine running at half speed the air in all the apartments of the library buildings will be renewed five times an hour, but provision will be made to allow the frequency of the change of air to be increased when desired.\n\nPICNIC OF THE \"CALTON CHAIR WORKS,\" GLASGOW.—Messrs. Keen Brothers, of these works, recently treated their employes and a few friends to a drive to Campsie Glen, a famous resort situated 14 miles from Glasgow.\n\nTHE PROPOSED NORTHERN RAILWAYS.—A large and representative meeting of crofters and fishermen has been held in Castlebay, in favour of the Schoolhouse terminus to the West Coast of the Mallaig Railway. Mr. H. V. M'Callum, Inverness, pointed out the great importance of the Hebrides being unanimous in deciding as to the best terminus, so as to enable the Railway Commission which is to sit in Inverness on the 21st inst. to decide, upon the information supplied to them, on such terminus. Several fishermen spoke in strong terms of the benefits which would accrue to them by having a railway terminus at Maillaig, as this would develop the fishing banks in the Minch, and particularly pointed out that more particularly around the Island of Canna, where, curing and kippering stations could be erected. It was ultimately agreed to pass the following resolution :— \"That this meeting respectfully press upon Her Majesty's Government the desirableness of having a railway terminus at Mallaig, such terminus being in their opinion the one which would confer the greatest benefit on the industries from which they derive their livelihood, and would best help to develop the resources of the Hebrides.\" It was decided to send copies of this resolution to Lord Lothian, General Hutchinson, K.C.B., the Chairman of the Railway Commission, and Mr. Fraser-Mackintosh, M.P.\n\nBELL & SIME,\nTimber Merchants & Saw-millers,\nDUNDEE SAW-MILLS,\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of AMERICAN and BALTIC TIMBER of every description.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Red and White Floorings and Linings, Mahogany Counter-tops, Mahogany, Cypress, Teak, Wainscot, Greenheart, and all kinds of Fancy Woods.
