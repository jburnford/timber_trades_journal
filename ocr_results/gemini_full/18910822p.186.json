When he joined Jerrard ten years ago, he had no capital, and owed no debts. Jerrard told him he had £500, and agreed to put that amount into the business. In March, 1890, they were in difficulties in consequence of having to pay the Corporation £100 for roadmaking in front of the property they had erected. At the private meeting of the creditors, held before the dissolution of partnership, he was under the belief that they could pay their creditors in full. They dissolved partnership for one reason, because they could not agree, and another reason was because Jerrard would not work or look after the men employed. The bankrupt passed his examination.\n\nAccording to \"Kemp's Mercantile Gazette,\" the number of failures in England and Wales gazetted during the week ending August 15th was 77. The number in the corresponding week of last year was 79, showing a decrease of 2, being a net decrease in 1891 of 48. The failures in the Building and Timber Trades were: 1891, 9; 1890, 8; 1889, 8; and in the Furniture and Upholstery Trades: 1891, 1; 1890, 3; 1889, 4.\n\nBANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.\nFREEMAN THOMAS WILLIAM, joiner and builder, 65, Thomas Street, Limehouse.

July 15, 1891.\n\nCARDIFF TIMBER TRADE AND RAILWAY RATES.\nTHE vexed question of railway rates in relation to the timber trade came up at Wednesday's meeting of the Cardiff Chamber of Commerce. A letter on the subject was read from the London Chamber of Commerce, communicating the decision of a joint committee, that timber should be carried by machine weight instead of by computed measurement, as had been the practice of the trade.\nMr. W. Riley said as Parliament had confirmed the decision of the Joint Committee, and the matter had become law, he did not think it was necessary for the Chamber to deal with it. He was not an advocate of the old method of computed measurement; he had always stood out for actual weight. The system of computed measured weight was one which lent itself to fraud. The railway companies had no means of checking any given consignment, consequently each merchant declared his own weight. It was difficult to say what one or another merchant would declare their weight of goods at, so that they had difficulty in knowing how to compete. With an actual weight, however, they would all be on an equality. Cardiff was a steamship owning port, and if they had to wait to have every deal measured by the railway companies before it could be put on the trucks, it would take many weeks to discharge a steamer. With a weighbridge the operation would occupy but a few hours.\nMr. J. M. Jennings said there was a great divergence of opinion in the timber trade on this subject, about four-fifths, or nine-tenths, being in favour of measurement weight. That was to say, when they brought in their timber they should pay so much for a certain number of feet. They asked the railway companies to carry it in the future as they had done in the past—at an average rate per load. Timber might be wet when loaded and become dried on the journey; thus by machine weight they would be an injustice done. By measurement, however, they could check the actual quantity loaded, whilst with machine weight there would always be questions arising. Parliament had given way in several matters, they had put timber into a cheaper class, and they have decided that deals—which were the great trade of the country—should be carried by measurement.\nMr. Riley remarked that the Messrs. Watson, of Cardiff, signed a petition to the Board of Trade in favour of actual machine weight. Of course, they had a perfect right to change their opinion.\nThe Chairman (Mr. E. H. Wills) said there had been a great difference of opinion in the trade in Cardiff on this subject, and, for his part, he should certainly prefer that the practice remained as it was.\nMr. J. B. Ferrier favoured machine weight, and he moved that the Chamber reply to the London Chamber of Commerce, stating that it was in favour of imperial weight.\nCouncillor Trounce seconded.\nMr. Jennings proposed the previous question. The matter, he said, was settled by Parliament, and they need not go out of the way to show there was a diversity of opinion in the trade of Cardiff.\nMr. D. A. Thomas, M.P., seconded the amendment, on the ground that the question had been disposed of in Parliament. He presumed that it was in consequence of the diversity of opinion which existed in Cardiff that the local members of Parliament were not approached on the subject. They would have been very glad, indeed, to take action in the matter on the recommendation of the Chamber of Commerce, but they were not requested to do so.\nThe previous question was lost by a substantial majority, and the resolution carried.\n\nANOTHER FOREST FIRE IN FRANCE.—Reuter's telegram from Cannes, dated August 20th, says:—A forest fire of considerable extent is raging between Mandelieu and Pagomas, and although the scene of the conflagration is some way inland, the cloud of smoke from the burning timber reaches as far as this place. A strong wind is blowing, and renders fruitless all efforts to check the flames, which are spreading rapidly.\n\n[AUGUST 22, 1891.\n\nTHE STRIKE AT THE BEEVOR BOBBIN WORKS, BARNSLEY.\nON Thursday, the 13th inst., Mr. Ald. Marsden and Mr. Frith, of the Yorkshire Miners' Association, sat at the Town-hall, Barnsley, as referees to settle the dispute between Messrs. J. W. Wilson & Co. and their workpeople. The men have been on strike since the 10th July. Messrs. W. Bowskill, W. Roe, J. Smithson, and W. Wells represented the men; and Messrs. J. W. Wilson, W. Wilson, and F. Birtles (J. Birtles & Summers) represented the firm. The point at issue was, \"Was the promise of a second 5 per cent. advance in wages to be paid by the firm on the first full pay day in July conditional or unconditional?\" The men said it was unconditional, the firm said it was conditional. The promise was made at an interview on the 25th March, when Mr. Walter Wilson was spokesman for his father. The men said he promised the first 5 per cent. at once, and the second as stated, unconditionally, and told them, if they could work the trade up, he would be glad to give another 10 per cent. on the top of that, and they accepted the offer, and wrote a letter of thanks to the firm. The firm submitted that the offer was conditional on other firms giving the advance and trade improving, neither of which events had occurred. They produced documents to show this was their view of the matter. It was clear that both sides believed themselves to be right, and the referees suggested a compromise, which has to be submitted to the men, who return to work on Monday, pending the decision of the referees.\n\nIMPORTS.\nBARROW.\nAug. 11 Gustaf Adolf (s)—Sundswall—45,833 sawn fir board ends, 397 lds. firewood—Estate of Wm.
