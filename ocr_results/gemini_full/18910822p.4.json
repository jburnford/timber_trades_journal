It preserves for us in a tangible and poetical form the memories of the past. Other scientists may be more brilliant, must be ever firm in their convictions of their worship of truth ; but the one lacerates, and dissects, and destroys the nest or endangers the bird in its flight. Their results are bottled in a cabinet, with mighty and jaw-breaking names, and the student of the future will have difficulty in realizing what they have reaped. But the arboriculturist would be as usefully employed as the late Joe Miller, who went to see a sample of the Falls of Niagara, or the report of a family picture, or the girth of a forest monarch. He gives invitation to such as are like-minded, or stuff the stray leaves in his book of measures, and adds another note to his arboriculturist, his book of records. Every lover of nature cannot but rejoice that in many parts of the country are favoured spots where the giants stand embowered in their own foliage, still lake and the rushing river, and the by pine-clad heights, and the green fields, each giving to each a charm which they cannot boast of singly. And how grand with their grand old histories, and the church near by peeping through the trees.\n\nGREENOCK.\nAug. 10 Choice-Quebec-476 logs waney board pine, 253 logs oak, 50 logs elm, 2,993 spruce deals-Brownlee & Co.\n12 Aline-Pensacola-1,864 pcs. sawn pitch pine timber, 1,058 sawn pitch pine deals-Brown & Co.\n13 Britannia-New York-313 pcs. oak lumber-J. & R.
