AUGUST
PROGRESS OF ARBORICULTURE.
FEW scientific subjects are more worthy of our attention, and none devotes itself to a higher purpose. It preserves for us in a tangible and poetical form the memories of the past. Other scientists may be more brilliant, must be ever firm in their convictions of their worship of truth ; but the one lacerates, and dissects, and destroys the nest or endangers the bird in its flight. Their results are bottled in a cabinet, with mighty and jaw-breaking names, and the student of the future will have difficulty in realizing what they have reaped. But the arboriculturist would be as usefully employed as the late Joe Miller, who went to see a sample of the Falls of Niagara, or the report of a family picture, or the girth of a forest monarch. He gives invitation to such as are like-minded, or stuff the stray leaves in his book of measures, and adds another note to his arboriculturist, his book of records. Every lover of nature cannot but rejoice that in many parts of the country are favoured spots where the giants stand embowered in their own foliage, still lake and the rushing river, and the by pine-clad heights, and the green fields, each giving to each a charm which they cannot boast of singly. And how grand with their grand old histories, and the church near by peeping through the trees.

CARBON CEMENT FOR COVERING BOILERS.
—The carbon cement manufactured by the Carbon Cement Company, Limited, Glasgow, appears to have earned an excellent reputation for the possession of its non-conducting properties, and for the ease with which it can be applied to boilers.
