FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.

BROOKS, JOHN LABBET, builder, Ilfracombe.—This failure has been several times previously reported. Bankrupt again attended at the Barnstaple Bankruptcy Court on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Bosson, for his adjourned public examination, but the same was not proceeded with, and upon the application of the Official Receiver adjourned until 1st October Court.

BULMER, WILLIAM, 144, Thornton Road, and 9, Zetland Place, Horton Lane, Bradford, coachbuilder.—Deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors. Trustee, John Butterfield, 8 and 10, Charles Street, Bradford (C.A.). Dated 22nd August, 1891. Filed 25th August, 1891. Unsecured liabilities £186 0s. 8d., estimated net assets £117 2s. The following are scheduled as creditors:—

COX, JUN., JOHN, builder and contractor, Elliston Road, Redlands, Bristol.—This bankrupt made an application for his discharge on Thursday last, before His Honour Judge Metcalfe. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had some explanation to offer about two contracts he had. He thought the bankrupt must have known the debts he latterly contracted were not likely to be paid in full. The bankrupt explained he had been in business for three years at work that was paying, before he took the contracts. The Official Receiver further stated that the creditors had received a dividend of 2s. 11½d. in the pound. Finally His Honour suspended the discharge for a month.

DAVIS, HENRY, builder, Constitution Hill, lately trading in Soho Road, Birmingham.—This bankrupt was charged at the Birmingham Police Court, on Friday last, with certain offences under the Bankruptcy Act. The Deputy Official Receiver asked for a remand in order that further investigation might be made. The chief allegation against the defendant was that when he filed his petition he said he paid away the sum of £59, but it was afterwards ascertained that he did not do so. Finally, the defendant was remanded, bail being granted, himself in £20, and one surety of £20.

GODDEN, EDWD. A., cabinet-maker, High Street, Walton.—The statement of affairs herein shows liabilities to unsecured creditors of £713 8s., and assets, stock-in-trade, £200; fixtures and fittings, £25; furniture, £30; book debts, £179 11s. 10d.; less preferential creditors, £9 3s. 10d.; leaving net assets, £425 8s.; deficiency, £288. The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition, and he has been adjudged bankrupt. He has carried on business since October, 1887, at which time his capital was £20. He says he traded successfully at first in a smaller shop, but that nine months ago he purchased for £850 a larger shop, and raised the money by two mortgages. He attributes his insolvency to the action of Messrs. Ashby in suing him, and states that shortly before the receiving order he assigned his books in satisfaction, or part satisfaction, of his overdraft to Messrs. Ashby. The bankrupt is not clear if he actually assigned the debts, but in his statement of affairs he has treated them as a free asset. An order has been made for summary administration.

HENLEY & CO., builders and contractors, 174, Annerley Road, Upper Norwood.—The public examination of these debtors came on for hearing at Croydon Court on Thursday last week, before Mr. Registrar Fox. The statement of affairs showed liabilities expected to rank £362 16s. 11d., and assets (including machinery and building plant £75, and book debts £37 9s. 9d.) £178 13s. 8d., leaving a total deficiency of £184 3s. 3d. The matter came up at a former court, when the debtors' solicitor applied for an adjournment on the ground that the assets disclosed by the statement amounted to practically nothing after paying expenses. He added that he had obtained from a third party an offer, which would probably result in

IMPORTANT TO THE TIMBER TRADE.
—Extract from Timber Trades Journal, 13th September, 1890. "It may be of interest and a pecuniary benefit to our readers to know that the SCOTTISH ALLIANCE INSURANCE COMPANY, of 106, CANNON STREET, LONDON, offers the trade special facilities for insuring against fire loss. The Company is controlled by a very influential body of directors and with a fully subscribed capital of £250,000. It is in every way worthy of credit."—[ADVT.]

the payment to the creditors of about 10s. in the pound. This the creditors were willing to accept, but the Official Receiver did not see his way to falling in with the arrangements, as he was of opinion that, under certain circumstances the creditors might get their full 20s. in the pound. The Assistant Official Receiver (Mr. J. G. Gibson) now stated that the Official Receiver was engaged in negotiations by which he hoped to enable the debtor to pay in full. A special meeting of creditors had been arranged for, but not held yet, therefore he applied for a further adjournment. Adjourned until the October sitting.

HOOKWAY, ROBERT TAYLOR, builder, Bideford.—This debtor came up for his public examination on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Bosson, at the Barnstaple Bankruptcy Court. Mr. Oerton (from Messrs. Rooker & Bazeley Bideford) represented the debtor, and Mr. Hole & Peard (Messrs. Hole, Peard, Bideford) was for the Devon and Cornwall Banking Company, the principal creditors. In answer to the Official Receiver, debtor said he had returned the Devon and Cornwall Bank as creditors for £2,500, but because he thought they were really not creditors for that amount. The Official Receiver was informed him that the bank had a judgment against him for that amount. He was still of opinion that there were items in the bank account, and other items in the accounts for which the bank sued, and that he was not liable for. There was an item of £43 10s., which he had paid into the Devon and Cornwall Bank, but which he had not been credited with. The Official Receiver read a letter that he had received from the bank stating that the £43 10s., to which debtor referred, formed part of a credit of £77 5s. paid in October 15th, 1889. The Official Receiver said he had nothing to complain of as regards Mr. Hookway. He had been anxious to give every assistance, he thought the examination should be adjourned. Mr. Peard appeared for the Devon and Cornwall Banking Company, and examined the debtor with respect to the items which he complained about as not having been credited. He considered it serious that such charges of inaccuracy should be made against the bank. As, however, the exact state of affairs could easily be ascertained from the bank books it was agreed that the debtor's solicitor should be supplied with the whole of the credit relating to the account. The Official Receiver re-examined the debtor with respect to the furniture now claimed by his wife. He explained that he did not say anything about it when the receiving order was at Bideford because he had not thought of it. He fancied it belonged to his mother, who used to live with them. The examination was adjourned until the October Court.

KENNEDY, THOMAS, builder, Granville North Street, Plymouth.—This case was reported last week. The statement of affairs filed shows liabilities to unsecured creditors of £897 5s. 1d., and assets, stock in trade £50, plant £30, book debts £108 2s. 9d., less preferential creditors £18, deficiency £695 2s. 4d.

KING, EDMUND, carpenter and joiner, Ernest House, Napier Road, Stapleton, Bristol. —An application was made at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court, on the 20th inst. for the discharge of the above bankrupt, before his Honour Judge Metcalfe. Mr. Jaques, who appeared on debtor's behalf, stated that the receiving order was made against the debtor in July, 1887, and although the liabilities were set down at £347, the proofs admitted only amounted to about £200, and a dividend of 1s. 2d. in the pound had been paid on those proofs. The bankrupt failed in 1875 and also in 1880. In 1875 the dividend amounted to 2s. 6d. in the pound, and in 1880 to 1s. 6d. in the pound, and now the dividend had been reduced to 1s. 2d. in the pound. The Official Receiver reported that it was a rather bad case, as the debtor had failed on three occasions, and if all the creditors had proved the estate would not have shown 1s. 2d. in the pound. The debtor had gone into business in some shape or form since his bankruptcy, as on July 28th he found
