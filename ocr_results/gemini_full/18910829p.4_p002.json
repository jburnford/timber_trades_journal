In 1890, a contract was entered into with Mr. Mackay, and by that contract the works have to be finished within two years from November last. These works will include a pier 825 feet in length along the river, and a retaining wall which will enclose several acres of what is now beach, but which is to be reclaimed for fish-curing and other purposes. On the opposite or Thurso east side a short wall or groyne will jut into the river, and it is expected that by this means the river, which the contractor has to deepen to the extent of four feet at low water, in ordinary spring tides, will scour itself. The present is the third attempt that has been made to secure a harbour for the town. In 1805, Sir John Sinclair, Bart., of Ulbster, obtained an Act, but the scheme fell through, it is said, for want of local support. Previous to that a wooden breakwater had been erected by the Thurso Company, but in 1855 it had become almost a wreck, and in 1857 another of wood—was put up. The second breakwater remained intact for many years, but in course of time it, too, began to give way, and had frequently to be repaired by the pavement merchants and others. In 1876 a company was formed for promoting a Bill in Parliament, but it was opposed by the Flagstone Quarrying Company, and was ultimately thrown out on the standing orders.\nROBERT HOWIE & SONS,\nNEWMILL, DUNLOP,\nTimber Merchants, Joiners, & Cartwrights,\nMakers of Washing Machines, Scythe Sneds, Hand Rakes, and Agricultural Woodwork of all descriptions.\nA large Stock of seasoned Hardwoods always on hand, and the trade supplied on liberal terms.\nOther Branches at\nBurntisland & Methil\nTelegraphic Address,\nAll Offices, \"DRYNAN.\"\nTelephone No. 1,603.",
