W., builder, Hastings.—The public examination of this bankrupt was held on Monday at the Hastings Bankruptcy Court, before the Deputy Registrar. In answer to the Official Receiver, the debtor said he had paid away to certain creditors. He had no particular reason for giving these a preference, but some of them pressed him, and others were poor people, who could ill afford to lose their money. He had received a County Court summons from a Mr. Rubie. He believed that was the only one he ever had. Finally the examination was closed.\nJASPER, GEORGE, builder, 30, Hanover Street, Sydenham, Kent.—The following are scheduled as creditors in this affair:—\n£ s. d.\nBlake & Co., Penge ... ... ... 52 2 0\nHunt & Green, London ... ... ... 16 0 0\nDannatt, Greenwich ... ... ... 19 0 0\nTree & Smith, London ... ... ... 15 0 0\nMay & Kennard, Harrow-on-Hill ... ... 46 0 0\nTurner & Son, London ... ... ... 70 0 0\nBurrows Brothers ... ... ... 35 0 0\n... ... ... ... ... 21 7 0\nBUTT, EDWARD, builder, Leeds.—This debtor attended the Leeds Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday. The examination had been ad­journed in order that the bankrupt might amend his statement of affairs with regard to the third and fourth charges on his real estate. No amendment, Mr. Bowling said, had been made, and the case was further adjourned in order that the order might be complied with.\nDAVIES, HENRY, builder, 147, Soho Road, Handsworth, Birmingham.—At the Birming­ham Police Court, on Friday week, this debtor was charged, that he being an adjudicated bankrupt, within the meaning of the Bank­ruptcy Acts of 1869 and 1883, did, after the commencement of such bankruptcy proceed­ings, make a false entry in certain documents affecting and relating to his property and affairs. Mr. Tanner, who appeared for the prosecution, explained that about a fortnight before the defendant filed his petition he re­ceived something like £200, and in order to account for the money that passed through his hands he stated that he paid a creditor named Bradford on March 14th last £60 18s. 4d., and gave him a bill of exchange for £50 on May 19th last. He produced a receipt for £60 18s. 4d., and a bill of exchange for £50. Bradford was examined before the Registrar, and it transpired that the defendant had only paid Bradford £50, for which the latter had given him in acknowledgment a bill of exchange for £50, and a receipt for £69. The defendant was thus enabled to put the £69 into his pocket. Subsequently the defendant relented, and gave every assistance to the trustee to recover the £50 which defendant paid Bradford on May 19th, the day he filed his petition. Finally the defendant was committed for trial at the Quarter Sessions, bail being allowed.\nMEADE, WILLIAM HARRY, builder and brickmaker, now out of business, Kirkby-le-Soken.—Deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors. Trustee: Edmund J. Craske, Col­chester, auctioneer. Dated 22nd August, 1891. Filed 28th August, 1891. Unsecured liabilities, £483 10s. 6d.; estimated net assets, £428; creditors fully secured, £1,110. The following are scheduled as creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nColchester Co-operative Building Society, Colchester ... ... ... ... 20 0 0\nCross J., Colchester ... ... ... 15 0 0\nDavey, D., Kirby-le-Soken ... ... ... 12 5 0\nGroom & Daniel's, Colchester ... ... ... 138 0 0\nHarvey E.

W. & Co., London ... ... 68 4 3\nMackenzie D., Clacton-on-Sea ... ... 59 10 6\nHALL, JAMES, undertaker and joiner, Smethwick.—On Monday, at West Bromwich County Court, before Mr. Registrar Watson, this debtor, who carried on business in Croc­kett's Lane, Smethwick, came up for his public examination. Mr. C. Woollett (Assist­ant Official Receiver) represented the Board of Trade; and Mr. Cross, of Birmingham, ap­peared for the debtor. The statement of affairs showed a deficiency of £150 18s. 7d.; there being no assets. In reply to Mr. Woollett,\nMahogany and Walnut Logs, Planks and Boards, Whitewood, Oak, and every descrip­tion of Hardwood Lumber. Hoar & Brown, West India Docks E. Telephone 5105.",
