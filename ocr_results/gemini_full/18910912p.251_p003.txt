THE BUILDING TRADES DISPUTE.
The Central Association of Master Builders of London, at a meeting held on Monday last, decided to introduce foreign workmen at once to take the place of the carpenters and joiners on strike.
Writing to a contemporary a correspondent says:—"Joiners and carpenters are paid 9d. per hour, and, as a rule, work 52 1/2 hours per week, making £1 19s. 4 1/2d., and are paid overtime extra at 1d. first hour, 2d. per hour up to 8 o'clock, and half-time extra after 8 p.m. and time after 12 p.m. Now they want 10d. per hour and to work 47 hours, making £1 19s. 2d. per week. What can be their object to work for 2 1/2d per week less? I answer, this is their motive—because they well know that 47 hours per week is a loss to the master builders in numerous ways, such as the idleness in which their horses and carmen, &c., will be kept. And the slow progress business will make, so they think the masters will give in and allow them to make overtime of 5 1/2 hours which will make 52 1/2 hours per week, and the hour from 5 to 6 p.m., and from 8 o'clock p.m, and on Saturdays overtime to commence at 12 noon, and to be paid 1s. 3d. per hour; if allowed to work 5 1/2 hours overtime per week at 1s. 3d. per hour it will add 6s. 10 1/2d. to the £1 19s. 2d., making a total of £2 6s. 0 1/2d. for 52 1/2 hours."
Mr. Richard Day, chairman of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, arrived in London on Wednesday from Manchester, the headquarters of the society. He stated that they were prepared to keep their men out on strike for two years, if necessary, and that cablegrams had been received from India, Australia, and America where the society has branches, that levies had been made in support of the men on strike in London, and that the money so collected was being sent to England.
We understand that in consequence of the great difficulty of obtaining English made joinery and the prohibitive cost it has now attained, a syndicate has been formed for the purpose of establishing manufactories on the Continent for both soft and hard wood in the English style.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BACKETT, GEORGE, builder, 1, Monson Road, Redhill, Surrey.—The Official Receiver for the Croydon district has now issued his summary and observations under this bankruptcy, of which the following is a copy:—Liabilities to unsecured creditors £310 15s. 7d., and assets as follows:—Cash in hand £1 10s., cash deposited with solicitor for costs of petition £10, furniture estimated to realise £35, book debts, good, £6 5s. 11d., total assets £52 15s. 11d., thus showing a deficiency amounting to £257 19s. 8d. The debtor's alleged causes of failure are :—"Being sued and underestimating my contract for Mr. Robinson's cottages." The report and observations of the Official Receiver are as follows:—The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition. Orders of adjudication and for the summary administration of the estate have been made. The debtor states he commenced business in August 1889, on his own account with a capital of £20, having previously been engaged as a foreman. The debtor's furniture, &c., was sold on the 24th ult., under an execution, and the High Bailiff of the County Court has been written to for an account of the proceeds. The action under which the execution was levied was by a creditor for goods supplied, the debtor alleging that he had paid the amount, but the judge decided against him. The debtor states that he first became aware of his insolvency on July 7th last. Net loss arising from carrying on business from August 27th, 1890, to date of receiving order, after deducting from profits, the usual trade expenses, £87 1s. 10d., expense incurred since August 27th, 1890, other than usual trade expenses, viz., household expenses of self and wife and six children £100, amount of debt and cost on judgment obtained by Mr. Stenning against me for goods that I had already paid for £70 17s. 10d., total accounted for £257 19s. 8d.
BILES, GEORGE THOMAS, carriage-builder and wheelwright, St. Mary's Road, Stechford.—A meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held yesterday week, at the office of the Official Receiver, Birmingham. The statement of affairs showed the liabilities to be £382 9s. 11d, and the net assets £121 0s. 6d., leaving a deficiency of £261 9s. 5d. The debtor commenced business in 1887 without capital, but with £135 borrowed from his friends, part of which was still owing. In 1889, being pressed by creditors, he borrowed £100, for which he gave a bill of sale, and agreed to pay interest at the rate of 25 per cent. per annum, £12 of which was still unpaid. The failure was attributed to want of capital and pressure by creditors. The case is a summary one, and the Official Receiver is the trustee.
EMERSON, WILLIAM HENRY, builder, 26, Yarborough Street, Grimsby.—On Wednesday at the Grimsby Bankruptcy Court a number of questions were put to this debtor, relative to his building operations on the Abbey estate. Debtor replied that he bought sufficient land for the building of four houses, which, however, he had not sufficient money to complete. He had had two cargoes of bricks from Mr. Goy. He said Mr. Goy had kept the accounts of the business and had rendered (debtor) once a quarter a book in which transactions were entered. Though he had never disputed the items entered, he saw, about 14 months ago, that things were going wrong, and asked Mr. Goy to set him free, even if he had to take all he had. He did not deny that according to the book referred to, the balance owing to Mr. Goy was over £900. Mr. Goy had promised to assist him, but he had pressed him when he knew he was unable to pay. The examination was adjourned for a month.
JOSE, RICHARD, builder, Truro.—The creditors of this debtor met at the offices of

Messrs. Hearle-Cook & Parkin, solicitors, on Thursday, when there were present, or represented, Mr. E. O. Trefry, Mr. J. W. Clunes, & Co., Fowey; R. Michell & Sons, Truro; W. T. Bennett, Truro; the Consolidated Bank of Cornwall, Truro, Mr. Hodge (Harvey & Co.) was voted to the chair. Mr. Hearle-Cook explained the position of affairs at length. Mr. Jose was indebted to the Consolidated Bank of Cornwall, Truro, in £1,768, less securities, estimated to realise £1,268, leaving £500 due to the bank and to trade creditors £792, total liabilities £1,292. The assets were: Stock-in-trade, £214; book debts, £76 10s.; total, £290 10s.; showing a deficiency of £1,002 8s. Mr. Jose attributed his present failure to a fire which took place on his business premises about three years ago, the property not being insured. An offer of 4s. in the pound was refused and the estate will probably be thrown into bankruptcy.
JOHNSON, F., builder, Church Hill Road, Barnsley.—The bankrupt attended for his public examination on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Hope. The receiving order was made in July last, upon the petition of Mr. E. G. Botes, of 91, Clapton Common, and the accounts showed liabilities to the amount of £2,439 11s. 11d., of which £1,154 2s. 4d. are secured, and £1,223 15s. fully secured, and which are estimated to realise £278 1s. Mr. Brougham (Official Receiver) having examined the bankrupt, his Honour ordered the examination to be concluded.
JOHNSON, JOHN EDWARD, joiner and builder, Deane Road, Deane.—The public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Bolton Bankruptcy Court on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Holden. The statement of affairs disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £502 18s. 11d., and assets, after deducting the claims of preference creditors payable in full, £281 17s. 4d., thus leaving a deficiency amounting to £300 6s. 8d. In answer to the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he commenced business in October, 1885, without any capital, but he was not in debt at the time. Previous to that he worked for his father. In 1885 he took contracts up to £30 or £40, by which he made money, and at the end of 1889 he had a surplus of about £20. His first large contract was for the woodwork at some cottages, at Bury New Road, the price being £268 10s. per house. This contract was made verbally, and some time afterwards another contract was entered into between the builder and himself, on which he lost money. He also lost £25 on Mawdsley Street School. The cause of his losing on his contracts was because he underestimated them. He lost £230 on a contract for some offices for a Mr. Boyle. This was owing to Mr. Boyle changing his plans, necessitating extra work. He was insolvent to the extent of £30 in October last, and since then he had entered into further contracts, hoping to retrieve his position. Finally the bankrupt was allowed to pass his public examination.
KENNEDY, THOMAS, builder, Plymouth. —At the East Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Edmonds, Mr. S. Clarke (for Mr. Trehane) appeared on behalf of the debtor. In reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he had had no partner in his business as a builder. He had also carried on business as a licensed victualler, at the Queen's Arms, North Street. The license had been passed over to the landlord. He was now claiming for recompense. Witness's chief business was that of a builder. Witness contracted to build a house at Plympton for Mr. Martin, for £3,674. He proceeded with the work without delay until March last, but the blizzard wrecked the house, and did damage to the amount of £350. Mr. Greenway: If the surveyor says that the storm would not have affected the house if you had carried out your work according to contract, is he right? Debtor: If the roof had been covered in, of course the storm would not have done so much damage. Mr. Greenway: Ought not the roof to have been on? Debtor: Not before March. We had four weeks of frost, when it was impossible to do any masonry. Continuing, witness said he tried to restore the building as rapidly as possible. He had received £1,430 under the contract, and estimated that there was work done to the value of £330 more. But he could not claim it under the contract. The Official
