F. Mackenzie. said :—\nScotland is very irregular in outline, being so broken up by promontories stretching far into the sea, and by arms of the sea deeply indenting the land, that a great portion of the interior lies within less than forty miles from the sea.\nThis accounts, to a large extent, for the difficulty in getting timber to grow at such high altitudes as it often does on the Continent.\nThe superficial area, according to the Board of Trade, is computed to be 30,463 square miles, or 19,496,133 statute acres; but the final results of the Ordnance Survey give 19,777,490 acres of land and water.\nThe latter includes lakes, rivers, rivulets, and permanent pools down to the horse pond.\nIt also includes land on the seaboard, and estuaries to low-water mark.\nSuch are the details laid down by the Ordnance Survey Department.\nIn order to find the total area suitable and available for the profitable growing of timber, we have to deduct the area under crops of all kinds, woodlands, gardens, nurseries, towns, villages, houses, railways, roads, and water, as also those portions of our glens and mountain sides that are profitably grazed by sheep and deer.\nThis done, we have found the actual area of waste land; I mean waste in comparison to what it might be if suitably employed.\nFrom this area we must deduct all high-lying exposed parts of our hills and mountains, quite unsuitable for the profitable growing, or even for the growth of any kind of timber.\nThis latter is regulated not so much by the height as by the distance inland, and the position of the mountain ranges, whether lying across the track of the prevailing winds of the district or along their path.\nVery good examples of this fact are to be met with at Rothiemurchus, Abernethy, Duthil, and Braemar, where the pine is to be found flourishing at an altitude of over 2,000 ft. above sea-level; and also in a large tract of country in the county of Aberdeen, from near Huntly to Alford.\nMany more instances could be given for our purpose.\nI now come to the figures already stated, the total area of Scotland is computed to be 19,496,133 acres imperial, of which, according to the Board of Trade Returns, under crops of all kinds, including grass under woods, 830,000 acres; orchards, and gardens, and nurseries, 6,920 acres; towns, houses, roads, railways, paths, and walls take up 1,093,300 acres; lakes, rivers, &c., 1,026,337 acres; and 1,260,021 acres are profitably grazed by sheep and deer; thus leaving 10,540,855 acres to be accounted for as semi waste-land.\nOf this latter area a large portion falls to be deducted as of no value for growing any kind of timber, viz., that portion of our island directly exposed to the storms from the Atlantic and North Sea, and the tops of mountains too high and exposed for the growth of timber.\nThis portion alone takes up 1,950,000 acres or thereby, including in its area all the highest slopes of our northern and eastern seaboard, leaving 8,590,855 acres or thereby worth less at the present moment, than 1s. 2s. per imperial acre.\nBut we have here a further deduction to make a rather curious but important one, viz., those roads and strips of waste land so very common in the Highlands and elsewhere, too small of themselves to be profitably planted, but which are included in the Ordnance Survey measurements, and are not given separately.\nI calculate the area of these to be, say, 146,322 acres.\nI may state that these latter figures are approximate, and are calculated on the basis of that found on given areas.\nAssuming these figures to be nearly correct, we are left with the still large surface of 8,444,533 acres highly suitable for the profitable production of first-class pine and other timber.\nThis, then, proves so far the great loss we, as a nation, have sustained, are still sustaining, and are likely to sustain for a time, by not appropriating to our advantage the waste lands of our own country.\nThe term waste land is perhaps a misnomer, as land can only be said to be waste by comparison with what its value might be under other and different circumstances and management—management more profitable to both the owners and the nation at large.\nThere are few countries of the same population to a given area which have so large a proportion of their surface comparatively waste or “idle,” and so small a proportion of growing woods to the unit of population.\nThis, no doubt, arises from the fact of our having an abundant supply of coal—wood for fuel being at a discount—and that there are no State forests or public interest in forestry.\nThe public, as a whole, admire trees merely for their fine effect in the landscape, or the pleasant green of their foliage, and the shelter and shade they give in street, park, or highway—forgetting all the while, or not knowing or caring to know, the immense influence for good trees have on their welfare generally, and particularly by their sanitary influence, their extraordinary power of ameliorating a rigid and changeful climate, and regulating storms, thereby greatly prolonging life itself; whilst, looking at the case from a commercial point of view, nothing is more certain than if the area of our woodlands were increased even fourfold, the fertility of the remaining portion of waste would be so increased as to be able to support a much larger amount of live stock, and would give better crops and earlier harvests than at present.\nThis is well understood in the district in which our meeting is being held—Easter Ross—as well as many other districts of Scotland, especially in the counties of Inverness, Aberdeen, Forfar, Perth, Berwick, and Roxburgh.\nMany parts of these counties are well wooded, not merely by large areas, but by the judicious arrangements of clumps, belts, &c. (we will see very good examples of this on the Fairburn estates), rendering valuable shelter to stock, thereby increasing the bulk of produce in a given time by about 30 per cent.\nThis is already so well known, that further example or reference is not required here.\nApart from this view of the case, however, the increased area of woodland would give necessarily a large increase of work to that class—the crofters—who most require it, and who, as a rule, reside in the districts where such operations require to be most extensively carried out.\nSuch increase would be of great advantage to the public at large, to the proprietors of the land, and to posterity —to the latter by retaining a large amount of the money sent out of the country to purchase that which we could produce for ourselves, and in many cases of a superior quality to that imported as “seconds” and “thirds,” the latter of which forms the greater bulk of our timber imports; and if you plant the 8,000,000 acres you find employment for 40,000 individuals.\nIn conclusion, it may be observed that the areas are dealt with in the Returns of the Board of Trade and by the Ordnance Survey, in a such a manner as to fully account for every acre under its different heading, with the exception of those parts of the Ross-shire, Inverness, and Perthshire Highlands where sheep are allowed to roam at large on the most barren portions of the mountains.\nThis is not only a loss to the stockmaster, but to the country, because, under such circumstances, the production of good mutton is limited by the exertion the animal has to put forth in order to obtain its living.\nThe owners of such stock are, of course, not the least anxious to fatten it, because, they say, it pays them much better to breed than feed.\nThis is the case under the present condition of the pastures, while, if large areas were planted, the result would naturally be different and better; besides creating employment for a larger number of people.\nDUNDEE.—The Dundee Institute of Architecture, Science, and Art are to-day (Saturday) holding their last excursion of the year, the destination being Sterling.\nIn our note last week of the change in the timber business at 19, Macfarlane Street Glasgow, we stated that it would be carried on by Mc. Hunter, Sons, & Co. ; this should have read M Hunter, Sons, & Co.\n\n13\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nSept. 9 Feder—Norrkoping 8 lds. firewood—John Cook & Son\n12 Express (s)—Windau—8,061 pit props—Tait\nALLOA.\nSept. 12 Express Memel—52,625 oak staves—J.
