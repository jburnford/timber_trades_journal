GAZETTE.
BEGG & WEBSTER, Builders, 15, Primrose Terrace, Edinburgh.—These debtors came up for their public examination at the Edinburgh Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week.—The debtors’ summary of accounts showed liabilities amounting to £886, and assets estimated to realise £275, thus leaving a deficiency of £611. As the agent had no questions to put to bankrupts, the statutory oath was administered, and the examination closed.
Mc VICAR, DUGALD, Builder, Sandbank, Glasgow.—At the Glasgow Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week, the above bankrupt appeared for his public examination before Sheriff Speas. The summary of accounts filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £998 16s. 2d., and assets returned at £379 0s. 6d., thus showing a deficiency of £619 15s. 8d. The debtor stated that he commenced business in 1868, with a capital of £70, as a builder, and he first became aware of the fact that he was in difficulties in 1887. He attributed his deficiency to bad debts, and depreciation of property.—Finally the debtor was allowed to pass.

TREE RECORDS.—We do not know where the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments draws its line; but we fancy that it has, as a rule, stopped short of taking note of old trees, says a writer in the Field. Of course there are several yews and oaks of such great and such long-established reputation that they are really signposts of the course of time; and, as such, eligible for the good services of the society. But we fancy that trees, as conservators of written records, are generally held somewhat cheaply; and that a large majority of the people who have a great esteem for rock inscriptions—for bronzes upon tombs, and even for the ordinary stone slab at the head and feet of, graves—would laugh to scorn the idea that any engraving upon the bark of a living tree could outlast the most fleeting of these.

A FOREST DESTROYER.
During a holiday stay in Upper Bavaria a correspondent of the Manchester Guardian has had occasion to notice and deplore the appearance of a new scourge which threatens to destroy wholesale many of the magnificent pine forests for which that region is so famous. He says:—These glorious woods are now in many cases a prey to a very small but powerful enemy. The destroyer appears in the shape of a beautiful white and black veined moth, known by the German name of “Nonne” (Liparis monacha). During the last two years it has multiplied to such an extent as to excite the liveliest apprehensions. In their greedy caterpillar stage these creatures know no rest till they have eaten away, from stem to crest, all the needles of the pine trees on which they have settled, thus depriving their victims of the prime conditions of health and life. It is a really depressing experience to pass through the woods which has suffered in this way. The pine trees stand bare and dreary, the stems, the ground, the paths are covered with the white-winged messengers of death, and they catch in the skirts and fasten on the coats of the wayfarers, making them feel, as is indeed the case, as if they were passing through a plague-stricken place. Many square miles of forest, containing thousands of trees nearly ready for felling, are in this condition. Numbers of workpeople are encamped in the stricken forests or quartered in the neighbouring villages to do battle with the enemy, by felling the infected trees and removing them on trucks, which run on temporary lines laid for the purpose. Haste is absolutely necessary, as if the wood is not quickly felled and removed it becomes an easy prey to the bark-beetle (Bostrichus typographus), which in a very short space of time renders it unfit for any better use than firewood. At first it was hoped that some remedy might be discovered to exterminate the evil. The entire youthful population of the neighbouring villages were enlisted in the service, and numbers of workpeople were engaged to collect and destroy the eggs, the caterpillars, and above all the butterflies. The trees were painted with rings of pitch at various heights, in order to prevent the young caterpillars, which usually emerge at the base of the tree, from creeping up to make their meal off the leaves. Recourse was had to fumigation with various substances, to drenching with mineral solutions, and even to the electric light, which, by attracting the butterflies in swarms, makes it possible to collect and destroy them en masse. So far all these attempts have been unsuccessful. Reports of the ravages of the “Nonne” pour in from all sides. A short time ago nearly all the Munich papers reported the unprecedented fact that some of the principal thoroughfares of the city, which are fitted with the electric light, presented the appearance of being covered with snow an inch deep. On closer inspection the apparent snow turned out to be masses of the dreaded butterfly, which had been attracted by the electric light. According to official reports

the Ebersberg forest, which lies between Munich and Tegernsee, and is Government property, is already completely destroyed, and the forests of Kasten and Hohenlinden are attacked. In fact, the same tale comes from all quarters—from the Austrian Tyrol as well.
The “Nonne,” or black arches, which is its English name, belongs to the family of the Bombycideae swarms during the months of July and August, and lays its innumerable eggs on and round the trunk and bark of the trees. The black, hairy, spiky caterpillars creep out early in the spring, fall upon the needles with incredible voracity, and in a short space of time “leave not a wrack behind.” They possess enormous vitality, and the hopes which were at first entertained that natural causes, such as severe and prolonged frost or heavy rains, might destroy them have so far been disappointed. Unfortunately, too, the majority of the insectivorous inhabitants of the forests, be they birds or insects, seem to have no appetite for them. Starlings, blackbirds, and ants form exceptions to this rule, and a Government order has accordingly been issued prohibiting the collecting of ants’ eggs. If this scourge continues, it will be a very serious matter all round. The “Nonne” does not confine its ravages to the conifers alone; in default of its favourite food, it attacks other trees also. Unlike the locusts of Asia and Africa, whose periodical descents destroy the harvest of a single year, the “Nonne” devastates at one fell blow the woods which have been the patient and unremitting care of many years of scientific forest culture. The infected trees have to be felled and removed in haste, and are disposed of at a great loss, and no further return from the forest land can be looked for before the lapse of another fifty or sixty years.
Nor does the mischief end here. When the trees are removed the valleys lose their protection against avalanches, and the surface solicits power of resistance to the effects of heavy rains, which swell each mountain rivulet into a torrent and cover field and pasture with the stones and débris swept down from the mountains. It is to be hoped that, failing other means, some exterminating disease may attack the ravaging insects, and by destroying this scourge preserve the noble pine trees of the mountains.
