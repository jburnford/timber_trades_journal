MAY & HASSELL forward their London stock list for September. It contains specifications of Russian and Swedish yellow and white deals, battens, and boards, floorings and matchings, and also of oak logs, mahogany, &c.\nA HARP OF WOOD.-Two Frenchmen are said to have invented a new kind of harp, made entirely of wood. Instead of strings the inventors use strips of American fir. The sound is produced, as in the ordinary harp, by the contact of the fingers; but the players wear leather gloves covered with resin. The tone of the instrument is of remarkable purity.\n\n277\nLEGAL INTELLIGENCE.\nA PARTNERSHIP CASE.\nBROWN v. W. P. BROWN AND C. N. BROWN.\nTHIS motion was heard in the High Court of Justice on Wednesday week, before Mr. Justice Collins. It was brought by Mr. Harry Brown, of Southtown, timber merchant, against Mr. William Palgrave Brown and Mr. Charles N. Brown, praying for the appointment of Mr. Lovewell Blake, chartered accountant, as the receiver and manager of the partnership business of W. Palgrave Brown, Sons, & Co., at Southtown, and for an injunction restraining the defendants, W. P. Brown and C. N. Brown, from excluding the plaintiff from the partnership offices and from preventing the plaintiff having access to the partnership books and papers. Mr. Marten, Q.C., and Mr. G. Welby (instructed by Messrs. Wiltshire & Son) appeared in support of the motion, and Mr. Millar, Q.C. (instructed by Messrs. Diver & Preston), for the defendants. The affidavits made by the respective parties having been read, and after hearing counsel on both sides, his Lordship made an order for the appointment of a receiver, the parties to apply in Chambers for the appointment, the defendants undertaking in the meantime that the plaintiff should have free access to the partnership premises and papers, the plaintiff undertaking to be of good behaviour and to return the books and papers belonging to the firm.\nAN AUCTION SALE DISPUTE.\nROBERTS v. STONE.\nTHIS action came on for hearing at the Exeter County Court, on Thursday week, before his Honour, Judge Stone. The plaintiff, a surgeon, sued the defendant, a timber merchant, of Swansea, to recover the sum of £17 16s. 6d., being the amount which should have been paid on account of lots of timber purchased by the defendant. Mr. Roberts, on behalf of the plaintiff, said his client was the owner of certain estates at Turlake and Cowley, Upton Pyne, and the defendant was a timber merchant who, until a few months ago, resided at Crediton. In December, last year, Messrs. Thompson & Co., auctioneers, on behalf of the plaintiff, sold a quantity of timber at the Three Horse Shoes. The defendant attended and bought several lots, but those in question, lots 88 to 91, were knocked down to him for £23. The sum of £1 16s. 1d. was the amount of deposit, which should have been paid on those lots with auctioneer's fees, and the further instalment became due on June 24th. The total purchase-money on the lots purchased by defendant was £99 10s. The sale was subject to certain conditions which were read previous to the auction, and at the foot of the conditions there was a contract which the defendant was asked to sign. As a matter of fact the defendant left the saleroom without signing the conditions or paying the deposit, but on the next day Mr. Thompson met the defendant at the Half Moon Hotel, Exeter, and reminded him that he had omitted to do so. The conditions were thereupon fetched, and defendant demurred at the lots 88 to 91 being entered to him, as he alleged that he did not purchase them. He, however, signed the contract and paid a cheque for £21, on account of the deposit. It was not the full deposit, but about the amount less the sum due in respect of those lots, and Mr. Thompson said he would accept the £21, on account. Various applications were made to defendant in respect of them, but he had refused to pay the purchase-money, and hence the action. After hearing the evidence of the auctioneer, Mr. Gale, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, said that he had advised his client to withdraw from the case. His Honour said that was the wisest course, and a verdict was entered for the plaintiff for the amount claimed.\nVILLAGES IN TREES.-One of the curious features of some of the islands of the Pacific is the tree village. The trunks of the trees, in the branches of which the natives have erected their houses, are perfectly straight and their surfaces smooth, while the distance from the ground to the first branch varies from 50 to 80 feet. One of these novel abodes is at a height of 80 ft. above the ground, while the home of a neighbouring one is 40 ft. higher. Each house is reached by a ladder made of some creeping vine, which is suspended from one of the door posts, and can be drawn up when it is desired.",
