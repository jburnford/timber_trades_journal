This is especially the case at the port of Marseilles, where at least 4,000 standards are received annually from Miramichi, St. John, Richibucto, and Halifax. He is of opinion that a large and profitable trade could be created between the two countries in lumber. At present, lumber from the Adriatic is extensively purchased because it is cheaper though inferior to Canadian woods.\n\nAUSTRALIAN TIMBERS.—Mr. James Green, of New South Wales, writes:—The value of our hardwood timbers is far more widely known than that of our ornamental woods; and some three years since the especial utility of the former for purposes of comparatively fire-proof construction was forcibly drawn attention to both by the President of the Institute of Architects of New South Wales, and by myself, after a most disastrous fire at one of the newspaper offices; for such purposes as piles and railway sleepers I doubt whether any country affords timbers more suitable than some of our gums and eucalyptus. Bearing in mind the expediency, from considerations of mutual interest, of promoting a still closer commercial intercourse than now exists, between the United Kingdom and Australia—New South Wales, I may remind, is (and is likely to remain) a free-trade country—the qualities and possible applications of Australian timbers is one of the matters connected with these colonies information respecting which it is desirable should be made as public as possible in England.",
