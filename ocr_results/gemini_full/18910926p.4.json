The plans were prepared by Mr. Barron, C.E., Aberdeen, and the contractor is Mr. John Malcolm, Thurso. The works have cost upwards of £4,000.\n\nTHEFT FROM A WOOD YARD.\nIn Edinburgh City Police Court, James Arnot, joiner, pleaded not guilty to the theft of wood from a wood rack in St. James' Rose Street Lane, on the 19th inst. The evidence showed that the wood was discovered by a constable in the workshop of the accused, who stated that he had got the wood from the workshop of Messrs. Aitken, Dott, & Sons to his order. He had a job situated close at hand. He had no money, and when arrested stated that he intended repaying himself for wood which he had borrowed from him by a packer in the employment of Messrs Aitken, Dott, & Co. The packer, in evidence, admitted that he had several times been exchanged wood, but denied that he had given any authority for the taking of the wood in the present case. Several witnesses spoke to the accused having been greatly intoxicated at the time of the theft. Sheriff Baxter remarked that the accused's subsequent statement as to the fact of his having taken off his boots, and also the fact as a deliberate one, was a serious one, but to inflict a small term of imprisonment would be useless. The sentence would be ten days' imprisonment.\n\nALEX. JACK & SONS, MAYBOLE.\nMAYBOLE is widely famous for its ancient and charming scenery, and for its many attractions to the tourists who annually resort thither. It is, however, of still great interest from a timber merchant's point of view, the extensive wood-working establishment of Alex. Jack & Sons being one of the chief industrial features of the town. We were somewhat surprised at the extent of these works and the large daily consumption that daily proceeds there. The firm was originally founded by Mr. Alex. Jack, who began business at Maybole as a wood merchant, occupying premises driven by water power, on the banks of the Doon, in 1835. He turned his attention to agricultural implement making.\n\nB H\n\nDUNDEE.\nImporters of\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Wainscot Flooring, and Pine Deals, Greenheart, &c.\n\nJAMES JOHNSTON,\nTimber Merchant and Saw-miller,\nTHE SHORE,\nSTIRLING.\n\nF.
