THE LAST OF THE OAKS OF BIRNAM.
BIRNAM has been rendered classic ground by the immortal Shakespeare, and in ancient times formed part of the Royal Forests of Scotland, being then covered with a vast forest of oak and probably Scots fir. The "last oaks," are, according to tradition, remnants of this ancient forest, and must, at this date, be close upon one thousand years old. These venerable monarchs are three in number, consisting of two oaks and a plane (sycamore). One oak and the plane are growing close to the river Tay, on the south bank, and immediately behind the Birnam Hotel, and about 800 yards east of Dunkeld Bridge. On account of their remarkable antiquity they are objects of great interest to the numerous tourists and others who frequent this romantic and picturesque neighbourhood.
The girth of the largest of the two oaks at 5 ft. from the ground is 18 ft. and that of the plane, which stands 80 ft. west of the oak, is 19 ft. 8 in. When the celebrated traveller, Dr. E. D. Clarke, visited Dunkeld early in the present century, he examined and measured these grand old trees, and seems to have been so impressed with their gigantic proportions, and enchanted with their magnificent surroundings, that I cannot do better, says a correspondent, than quote his remarks :—"To enrich this noble scene, the finest trees are seen flourishing with the greatest redundancy. How would Johnson have been astonished where one beholds this luxuriant valley proudly decorated with majestic oaks, sycamores, limes, beeches, maples, and all the glories of the forest! I measured a single oak close to the ferry, and found it to be 17 ft. in girth; and near it stood a sycamore of much greater magnitude." It will be seen by these measurements that the oak has only added a foot to its girth in about 70 years. The next oak of interest, which is said to be of the same age, is growing two miles to the south-
