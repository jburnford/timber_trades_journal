Mr. W. Cobbett, solicitor, and Mr. A. B. Potter again represented the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy; Mr. Beckton, solicitor, represented Mr. Houghton; and Mr. Attkins appeared for the bankrupt, Mr. Draffin, jun., who, having been released from prison on his own recognizances, duly fulfilled the order of the Court by attending.\nThe first witness called was Mr. W. Taylor, of the firm of Charles Taylor & Sons, timber merchants, 5, Canada Dock, Liverpool. In reply to questions from Mr. Cobbett, he said he knew the witness, Mr. George Houghton, whom he met in March or April, 1890. He was down at Canada Dock, looking out for some timber, when he (witness) accidentally entered into conversation with him. He was looking at some timber stored on the ground when he asked witness if he knew the firm of Draffin & Son at Manchester. Witness said he did not, and Houghton then told him they were wanting some Riga blocks, and that he had better see them. The following Tuesday, or soon afterwards, the witness did call upon Messrs. Draffin, and he served them with a quantity of Riga blocks.\nDid Houghton make any statement as to whether Draffins were or were not responsible persons?—I asked him, and he replied they were. He gave me to understand they were quite good enough for what they bought.\nYou were satisfied on his statement that they were quite good enough for what they bought?—Oh, quite.\nWhat was the value of the goods you sold to them?—Between £300 and £400 worth.\nHave you ever been paid?—My brother, who had charge of the financial arrangements, can answer that question better. I do not think we have.\nThere is another matter. When Draffin, junior, was examined by the Official Receiver in July, 1891, he made a statement with reference to a payment having been made to your firm in consequence of a threat to take proceedings against the bankrupts in respect of some fraud alleged to have been committed? —I believe that was so.\nThe statement was with reference to some Mr. Dixon, the bankrupts' cashier, having represented something to your firm?—I cannot quite speak off the book. Mr. Dixon, as far as I remember, came over to Liverpool and endeavoured to arrange that our firm should make an advance to the bankrupts.\nExamined by Mr. Beckton, the witness said that was the only occasion on which he had a conversation with Mr. Houghton, and at that time he was endeavouring to sell goods to Mr. Houghton. Mr. Houghton informed him that he had done business with Draffin's himself.\nBy Mr. Cobbett: He was relying on Houghton's recommendation when he supplied the Draffins with the timber.\nMr. Charles Thomas Taylor, brother of the last witness and a member of the firm, said the goods in question were sold partly in compliance with Mr. Houghton's recommendation, and partly subject to witness having an interview with the bankrupts. They sold them timber amounting to £730. The date was the 6th May, and the deliveries commenced soon afterwards. They had been paid something on account. There was a balance owing to them of £300 odd, and to the Bank of Liverpool, as holders of one of the bills, £100 odd. Altogether there was a balance owing of about £400 to them and the bank. At the end of August last year Mr. Dixon came over to Liverpool, and saw witness at his office. Mr. Dixon stated that he had just been put in charge of the cash affairs of Draffins, and he was surprised to find that early in September one of their acceptances would mature. He had nothing in hand to meet it, as Draffins' ready money had been drained in order to secure the discount on some large purchases in hoop iron and nails, which had been made, as they feared a rise in the market. It was for about 80 tons of hoop iron and nails. Dixon then asked him to renew the bill, which was for £411 15s. 4d., maturing on the 9th September, a fortnight afterwards. He declined to do so as a whole, but as he was leaving for his holidays on the 3rd September, witness arranged with Dixon that if on seeing Mr. Draffin they could find the balance of the bill\nMahogany and Walnut Logs, Planks and Boards, Whitewood, Oak, and every description of Hardwood Lumber.
