By J. Spencer, B Sc., F.C.S. London: Percival & Co., 1891.\nPhysiography is one of the most interesting subjects in the syllabus of the Science and Art Department, and every well-informed man should have a knowledge of, at least, the elements of the subject. Glancing at the properties of matter, frictional and voltaic electricity, and chemical action, it embraces the initial steps in the study of forces which are everywhere apparent, and the other divisions are equally interesting, dealing, as they do, with the changes which the earth's surf ce has undergone, the crust of the earth, earthquakes and volcanoes, the ocean, the air, and the effect of natural features on the climate and weather. This is, in reality, a brief category of the main sections of Mr. Spencer's book, which is admirably calculated to guide the reader and the student preparing for examination in the elementary stage. A hundred excellent diagrams and some clear and useful charts add to the practical value of the work, which affords a pleasant contrast to the text-books of a decade ago. The arrangement of the chapters and the sub-sections with their further division into well-defined paragraphs afford every facility both for purposes of reference and study.\n\nAUSTRALIAN TIMBER TRADE.\nMessrs. GEMMELL, TUCKETT, & Co., in their monthly timber report, dated Melbourne, August 31st, say:—Since our issue of the 3rd inst. there has been a slight improvement in the demand for some lines of timber, but prices realised show no advance on those ruling at the date of our last report. Stocks of most descriptions of timber are so heavy that the demand would have to be quadrupled to have any appreciable effect on the quantities in store, without taking into account goo Is advised to arrive during the period named. At the present moment the country is looking splendid, and the prospects of the farmers and pastoralists for the coming season never looked better than they do now; therefore it is quite likely that the early part of 1892 may witness a large increase in the demand for all descriptions of building materials, and a renewal of the prosperous times to which we have been strangers during the past twelve months. Norwegian and Scotch flooring:—Imports, 1,539,682 ft. lineal. Sales at auction aggregate 1,789,316 ft. lineal, realising—for red 6 x 1 1/4 and g., 9s.; 6 x 7/8 do., 6s. 6d.; 4-out weather-boards, 4s.; white, 6 x 1 1/4 t. and g., 7s. 9d.; 6 x 7/8 do., 6s. 3d.; 6 x 5/8 do., 5s. 3d.; 6 x 1/2 do, beaded, 6s.; 6 x 5/8 do., 3s. 10d.; 4-out weatherboards, 3s. 3d. per 100 ft. lineal. Small parcels of white 6 x 1/2 t. and g. beaded have been quitted privately, 4s. 10d. per 100 ft. lineal. Stocks are steadily increasing, and the trade are only purchasing for actual requirements. Baltic deals:—Imports, 15,601 pieces. There is hardly any demand for this line, the trade only purchasing for their barest requirements, a small parcel, ex Artemis, S 1/2 F, realising—for 11 x 3, 5 1/2d.; 9 x 3, 5d. per foot of 9 x 3.\nMessrs. FRASER & Co., Limited, on the 3rd September, reported:—Though business during the past month has been characterised by that quietness which has pervaded previous months, yet there are now indications of improvement, and, although the transactions reported are small, there is a better feeling in the trade and more desire is evinced to purchase. Anything approaching a \"boom,\" however, is not to be expected, and it will be wise for importers to operate upon a moderate scale and to exercise great caution for a few months at least. Stocks of most lines are heavy, and it will be some time before these are reduced to reasonable limits. Spruce and Baltic white deals:—Imports, 632,191 ft. super. Arrivals—Lalla and Dilbhur, from Fredrikstad; Pinmore, from New York. Scarcely any business has been reported, and quotations are nominally 3 1/2d. per foot of 9 x 3 for good spruce. Oregon pine:—Imports, nil. The consumption has",
