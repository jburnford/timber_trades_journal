J. & T. SCOTT'S CABINET WORKS, EDINBURGH.
THIS is one of the oldest established firms in Edinburgh of this important branch of industry that from year to year is of increasing interest to the timber trade. No few branches has so great a revolution taken place within the last twenty years as that of cabinet-making.
The genius of the inventor of modern machinery has been peculiarly successful, his mechanical appliances have been so fully adapted to the manufacturer's wants, resulting in more perfect and finished workmanship, no less than in the reduced cost of production, thereby placing within more popular reach a larger amount of household furniture. The volume of trade has therefore increased in this period in a remarkable degree, and has caused the cabinet-making trade to become a factor of no little importance in the increased imports of hard woods, dye and fancy woods, that has characterised the timber import returns of recent years.
In J. & T. Scott's works a very fair specimen of the general development that has taken place. Commenced some sixty-five years ago, on a very small scale, the firm continued to occupy the same premises commensurate with the business that was at that time found profitable. The business, however, steadily grew on their hands, and additions were from time to time made to their premises, until they have their establishment, adjoining Haymarket Station, forming a complete network of its kind, fully equipped with machinery and appliances for the production of every kind of household and office furniture.
The premises occupy over an acre of ground, and are splendidly arranged for the economical working of the trade. The show shop is a commodious three-storey building, two flat being filled with row upon row of over 50 men finding accommodation.
