There was a fair company, and a large catalogue of mahogany, walnut, and other high-class wood was submitted. The bidding was slow, and the amount of business done rather limited. The lots of cut boards, planks, &c. Good walnut sold perhaps more freely than the other woods, considerable quantities of which went to Aberdeen buyers. Prices varied from 5d. upwards. Wide yellow pine sold at 3½d. for 2, and mahogany from 6d. to 10d.\n\nTELEGRAMS, \"ROBINSONS, GLASGOW.\" TELEPHONE NO. 2002.\nRobinson, Dunn, & Co.,\nTIMBER IMPORTERS,\nPartick, Glasgow.\nSawing, Planing, and Moulding Mills at Partick and Temple.\nCreosoting Works at Temple.\n\nJAMES DONALDSON & SONS,\nTimber Merchants and Saw-millers,\nTAYPORT, (Also at LEVEN, FIFE.)\nEVERY DESCRIPTION OF BALTIC AND AMERICAN TIMBER.\n\nOCTOBER 31, 1891.\nBUILDING.\nCARNOUSTIE.—A new Episcopal Church is in course of erection at Carnoustie.
