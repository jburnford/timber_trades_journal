SALE OF SEASONED HARDWOODS.—A public sale was held in Edinburgh on Wednesday, by Brown Bros., at their Caledonian yards. There was a fair company, and a large catalogue of mahogany, walnut, and other high-class wood was submitted. The bidding was slow, and the amount of business done rather limited. The lots of cut boards, planks, &c. Good walnut sold perhaps more freely than the other woods, considerable quantities of which went to Aberdeen buyers. Prices varied from 5d. upwards. Wide yellow pine sold at 3½d. for 2, and mahogany from 6d. to 10d.
