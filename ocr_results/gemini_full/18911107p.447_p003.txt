COOPER, GEORGE, timber merchant, 201, Bethnal Green Road, E.—The debtor filed his petition on October 2nd, and the accounts, which have now been furnished, show total liabilities £1,610 16s. of which £980 are fully secured, and £1,302 10s. expected to rank, the assets (after providing for preferential payments) being estimated to realise £44 10s. Debtor states that the business was formerly carried on by his father, and that he purchased it from him about 20 years ago. He attributes his insolvency to his expenses having exceeded his profits during the last three or four years, owing to small profits and keen competition, also to losses by bad debts and the cost of keeping a number of horses, &c. The unsecured debts appear to be mostly for timber purchased during the last three years. The following are the creditors scheduled :—
Baker & Co., Cambridge Heath ... ... £4 4 0
Beach & Co., Commercial Road ... ... 125 10 9

DRAFFIN & SONS, packing-case makers, Manchester.—At the Manchester Bankruptcy Court, on Wednesday, this matter which has already been before Mr. Registrar Lister several times, was again mentioned by the Official Receiver, Mr. C. J. Dibb, who said that Mr. Cobbett, who had had charge of the case, was unable to attend that day, and, with the consent of his friend, he had to apply that the case should stand over till the 12th inst. at eleven o'clock. Mr. Dibb added that the case would not, he thought, occupy the attention of the Court more than five minutes on that day. The Registrar consented, and the matter was again adjourned. The younger bankrupt was in court during the time the application was made.
GREENWOOD, JAMES, builder and contractor, Maltby Road, Bermondsey, 85, Cannon Street, E.C., and Cheam Road, Surrey. —The debtor, trading as James Greenwood & Son, has filed his petition and on Wednesday a receiving order was made. The unsecured debts are returned at £5,400, debts fully secured £4,700, and preferential claims £83. The assets and property held as security appear to be of about the same amount as the liabilities, subject to realisation.
