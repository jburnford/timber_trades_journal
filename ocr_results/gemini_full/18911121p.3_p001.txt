LEITH.
There are more arrivals of wood goods this week, including several cargoes of deals and battens.
Besides the *Moscow* (s), from Cronstadt, which brought 3,195 pieces lathwood, 15 fathoms firewood, and 15,606 deals and battens for sundry importers, there are the *Courier*, from Helsingfors, with 11,065 battens, the *Haabet*, from Bollsta, with 15,461 deals, and the *Salween*, from Helsingfors, with 9,927 deals and battens, all for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co.
This firm have also a Quebec cargo still to arrive, but otherwise the season's shipments are now well in.
Some curious differences in rates of freight appear among the recent arrivals, the rate paid by the *Moscow* (s), from Cronstadt, being 32s. 6d., whilst the *Haabet* from Bollsta (Hernosand), only 23s.

The weather has been disagreeably wet, and not favourable for deliveries of wood goods, which have rather tended to fall off.
Altogether business has been quieter, and although Messrs. A. Garland & Roger held a public sale on Tuesday, 17th inst., at which a large selection of American and Baltic goods was offered, the quantity placed was disappointing.
The forenoon of Tuesday was very wet, and although it cleared up shortly after noon, and there was a fair representation of both town and country buyers at the sale, the attendance was not as large as usual, nor could it reasonably might have been expected with the large choice of goods offered.
Prices were well maintained for both American and Baltic goods; indeed, the exposers did not seem anxious to press sales; and where the limits were not forthcoming the goods were passed, but no special advance in values can be quoted.

MESSRS. CRAVEN BROTHERS, Darnall Carriage and Waggon Works, Sheffield, have obtained an order for the North British Railway Company for the supply of 200 sets of wheels and axles.

A COMPLIMENTARY dinner was given last week in the Grand Restaurant, St. Andrew Street, Edinburgh, to Mr. Thomas Murray who has catered for the Leith timber sales for many years, and is well known to the trade, licensed grocer, Edinburgh, on the occasion of his departure for London.
Mr. R. Wilson, ex-M.P., presided over a company of about fifty gentlemen, and Mr. Charles Forrest acted as croupier.
The toast of the guest of the evening was proposed by the chairman, who referred in eulogistic terms to Mr. Murray's sound business qualities and the high reputation he had earned for himself in Edinburgh.
Mr. Murray, in reply, expressed his regret at parting from so many friends.

MOTHERWELL.—DEAN OF GUILD COURT.—Plans have been passed for two tenements of dwelling-houses at Flemington, to be erected by Mr. Alex. Yuille, gas manager, and also for five tenements of dwelling-houses in Airbles Street, for Mr. Hugh Shaw, sanitary inspector, Motherwell.
Interdicts to the Court of Session not having been applied for by parties objecting to the erection of an auction mart in Merry Street (adjoining Dalziel Parish Church) by Mr. Alex. F. Nicoll, Coatbridge, the Magistrates found that the proposed buildings were connected to the property let to the petitioner by the Caledonian Railway Company, and could be executed without danger, and that the proposed premises were structurally satisfactory.
They therefore granted the petition, reserving to the Commissioners of the burgh at any future time power to call upon the petitioner to introduce a proper system of drainage into the auction mart and office and subjects let to him.
They found no expenses due to or by either party.
