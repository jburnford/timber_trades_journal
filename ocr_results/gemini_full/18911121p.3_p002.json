William Gray & Co., was originally founded on the site of the present premises by the father of Mr. Gray, in the year 1855.\nAlthough started on a comparatively moderate scale, still, by the energy and honourable methods of the proprietors in the management of the business, a large and steadily increasing trade has been developed.\nIn the year 1865, a fire occurred by which their premises were destroyed, but this afforded an opportunity of reconstruction on a more extensive scale, and of introducing more modern machinery into their saw mill, which they were unable to do before owing to the want of space in the old premises.\nThese are well adapted and excellently equipped in every respect for the work which is carried on.\nThe machinery in full operation comprises the following :—six circular saws, one circular continuous feeding saw, one upright saw (30 in.), one flooring machine, and one band saw.\nThe saw-mill is built of brick, with corrugated iron roofing, and is about 75 ft. long and 45 ft. broad.\nThe whole of the premises, including yard, covers an area of about one acre.\nThey are excellently situated, being adjacent to both railway station and harbour, thus affording splendid facilities for the conveyance of goods.\nThe yard is filled with a large and varied stock of deals, battens, and other timber goods.\n\nRobinson, Dunn, & Co.,\nTIMBER IMPORTERS,\nPartick, Glasgow.\nSawing, Planing, and Moulding Mills at Partick and Temple.\nCreosoting Works at Temple.\n\nJAMES DONALDSON & SONS,\nTimber Merchants and Saw-millers,\nTAYPORT, (Also at LEVEN, FIFE.)\nEVERY DESCRIPTION OF BALTIC AND AMERICAN TIMBER.\n\nCAMERON BROTHERS,\nTIMBER IMPORTERS AND SAW-MILLERS,\nPERTH SAW-MILLS, PERTH.\nBRANCH YARD AT NEWBURGH.\n\nNOVEMBER 21, 1891\nMany are the sources for which timber is used in a district like Fraserburgh, in all the departments of which Messrs. William Gray & Co. engage, the principal, of course, being in connection with the fish-curing industry, to the success of which the prosperity of the town is due.\nMr. Gray possesses a thorough knowledge of the timber trade, is well-known and highly respected in commercial circles.\n\nKIRKCALDY.—It has been authoritatively stated that the new Kirkcaldy and District Railway and the large dock and harbour in course of construction have been acquired by the North British Company, who intend completing the authorised lines and also the dock and harbour, which will be the deepest in the Firth of Forth, and of great importance to the Fife coalmasters.\nABERDEEN.—A report has been submitted to the Aberdeen Town Council by a committee as to the propriety of providing for increased storage and additional filter-beds at Invercannie, in connection with the Corporation waterworks.\nThe construction is recommended of an additional storage or settling reservoir at Invercannie, capable of holding about 35,000,000 gallons, with six new filter-beds.\nThe cost of the land and works is estimated at £67,000, which includes the site for a second storage reservoir.\nThe committee has been empowered to consult a professional engineer on the whole question of the water supply for the city, also to institute proceedings for preventing the contamination of the Dee by the discharge of sewage at certain villages.\n\nCENTRAL SAW-MILLS, GLASGOW.\nIN former times, the two trades of saw-millers and timber merchants were two distinct trades, and in many instances carried on separately by different firms, but the ever-changing conditions of the timber trade has had the effect of assimilating them, making it a necessity that the two businesses be connected in one business.\nThe saw-mills now remain that they may confine themselves to working for the trade, and merchants are consequently providing themselves with facilities in their own manufacture to meet the requirements of their customers.\nThe firm of J. & W. Garroway, carried on a successful business for many years in the Gallowgate, which has become a hive of industry, and where property values have developed an extraordinary value in connection.\nThe proposed extensions, which have assumed, caused them to look out for the construction of saw-mills in a less busy thoroughfare in which land could be located, seldom does an opportunity for the acquisition of suitable premises occur, but a difficulty has, however, been overcome by the vacation of the Gallowgate mills, which they immediately took, as on announcement, and they are now all in full working order, and they were enabled to take possession and commence operations with only a few days’ stoppage.\nThese mills will now be carried on as an extension of their own business, their old yard being retained for storage and other purposes.\nThe saw-mill is a substantial brick building, about 80 ft., in two sections, of two and three stories in height; the one section contains a heavy vertical log frame capable of cutting up to 30 inches, a double cross-cut saw, and a 80ft. travelling circular bench, specially adapted for cutting log lengths.\n\nBROWNLEE & CO.,\nDUNDEE.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Home and Foreign Timber, Wainscot Flooring, and Mouldings.
