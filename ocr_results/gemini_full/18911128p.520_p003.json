The deputy Official Receiver stated that the liabilities amounted to £295 9s., and the assets to £159 12s. 2d. A first and final dividend of 7s. 2d. in the pound had been made. Mr. Jardine, who appeared on behalf of bankrupt, stated that four years had elapsed since the petition was filed. The debtor was now working as a journeyman at St. Annes-on-Sea, and received 30s. per week. Finally His Honour granted the discharge, subject to four months' suspension.\nBULCOCK, WILLIAM, builder, Sandringham Road, Tuebrook.—At the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court, yesterday week, this debtor applied for his discharge. The statement of affairs showed liabilities of £35,942, due to creditors fully secured. There were no unsecured creditors, and a surplus of £3,645 consisted entirely of equities. The application was originally made about twelve months ago, and was then adjourned for a year, to give the bankrupt an opportunity of making an offer to the creditors. The Official Receiver (Mr. Gittins) reported that he had not succeeded in realising any of the equities, and consequently no dividend had been paid. Mr. Edward Whitley, M.P., was a creditor for £2,076, and the application was opposed on his behalf. His Honour, Judge Collier, after having questioned the bankrupt, granted the discharge subject to six months' suspension.\nCOOPER, GEORGE, timber merchant, 240, Bethnal Green Road, E.—The receiving order in this case was made on October 2nd, and the bankrupt attended before Mr. Registrar Giffard for public examination on Wednesday last. The liabilities are returned at £1,610, of which £1,302 is unsecured, against assets\n\nTeak Timber and Rock Elm, first-class Yellow and Waney Pine Timber, and every description of Shipbuilding Wood.—Hoar & Brown.\n\nNOVEMBER 28, 1891.\nestimated to produce £42. In answer to Mr. Gray, the Assistant Receiver, the bankrupt said the business was formerly carried on by his father, from whom he purchased about twenty-two years ago. He had never had any capital of his own, but at the time he commenced business he borrowed from his father £300 or £400, which he repaid by instalments. He effected an arrangement with creditors about eleven years ago, under which he paid a composition of 2s. 6d. in the pound, on debts amounting to about £700. A private meeting of his creditors was held at his solicitor's office on the 25th of September last. He then offered a composition of 2s. in the pound, but, owing to the opposition of three of the creditors, the proposal was not accepted. His insolvency was due to his trade and personal expenses having exceeded his profits during the last three or four years, owing to competition, losses by bad debts, and death of horses. The unsecured debts were mostly for goods purchased during the last three years. It was a fact that he had been practically insolvent during the last two years, but his principal creditors had always been aware of his position and had assisted him to continue the business. He had never prepared a balance-sheet or otherwise ascertained his exact financial position. He had not incurred any losses other than those in connection with his business. In the absence of any opposition, the bankrupt was then allowed to pass.\nDAVIES, JACOB, builder and contractor, 3, Windsor Road, Barry.—Deed of assignment for benefit of creditors. Trustee, Charles Pontypridd, accountant. Dated 14th November, 1891. Filed 19th November, 1891. Unsecured liabilities £400, estimated net assets £850, creditors fully secured £850.

Brougham, Official Receiver. The debtor's amended statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £22,344 15s. 8d., of which £3,774 15s. 8d. were expected to rank, and in the event of various properties realising what was estimated there would be a surplus, but as things at present stood there would be a deficiency of £3,489 13s. 8d. The debtor states that he was secretary of the London Timber Trades Association in 1882, and he is now described as an accountant, of 61, Cheapside. He attributes his failure particularly to his present inability to realise land at Laindon, Essex, where he intended to make a race course. He stated at the meeting that he had had a scheme to the Official Receiver, but had afterwards withdrawn it. He thought his estate could be more beneficially realised under a scheme than in bankruptcy. He had submitted to him, and he was sorry to say that in the matter there were three cases in connection with this trust money had been used for other purposes than for those trusts. He added that he thought there was no chance of the creditors getting anything in bankruptcy, and very little chance of anything if the matter did not go into bankruptcy. He asked the debtor if he had now any offer to submit to his creditors? The debtor replied that he proposed to submit 20s. in the pound.
