LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
A SHIPPING CASE.
Proof was led in Falkirk Sheriff Court on Monday—before Sheriff-substitute Scott Moncrieff—in the action at the instance of Captain Rasmussen, master of the Norwegian schooner Singborg, against Messrs. J. T. Salvesen and Co., of Grangemouth, for £14 10s. 6d., being balance of freight for a cargo of pit props from Finland, to Grangemouth. It was proved that the schooner Marie arrived at the entrance to Grangemouth Docks on the forenoon of 18th September, but in consequence of a block at the docks was not admitted until 24 hours later. In the meantime the captain had gone ashore, and having no information from his owners or agent for the charterers—Messrs. Chr. Salvesen & Co., London—he applied to Messrs. J. T. Salvesen & Co., shipping agents, Grangemouth, to have the ship reported at the Custom House, which was done by Messrs. Salvesen & Co. It was proved that the ship on her arrival was within the limits of Grangemouth harbour mouth, and that consequently she was entitled to be entered at the Custom House within 24 hours after her arrival. Messrs. Chr. Salvesen & Co.'s shipbroking clerk stated that he did not understand that the ship was to be reported until he received instructions. Evidence was also given to the effect that the fee for clearing a ship of the Singborg's size was about 10s. or one guinea, and that it was also the custom that the agent who reported the vessel got any further business which might arise out of the chartering of the vessel. For the defence, Mr. J. B. Allan, solicitor, contended that the charges had been incurred, in respect that the pursuer failed to intimate his name to the defenders, and that in this case the name of the broker was not mentioned.
