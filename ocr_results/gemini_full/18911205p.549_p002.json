The mineral deposits also included rich fireclay, red and white clay, limestone, &c. The land was well watered, and the agricultural land was the richest in the district. A considerable number of farms had been leased, and others were being inquired after. In conclusion, he moved the adoption of the report and accounts. Mr. R. F.
