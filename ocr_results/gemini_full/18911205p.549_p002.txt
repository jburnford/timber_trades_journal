Although business has not been brisk during the past month, a decidedly healthy tone prevails and prices are still in the ascendant; when the advanced figures were at first quoted buyers held off in the hope that a week or two might see them down again, but finding that there are no indications of a fall they are now placing their orders, and business will in all probability result better during the ensuing month.
The quantity of deals brought in is large; the consignees are Messrs. T. & C. Martin, Thomas, & Co., R. Martin & Co., William Graham, and Robinsons (Limited). The flooring boards are to Messrs. Leake & Co. and Robinsons (Limited), all the timber and lathwood to William Graham, and the staves to Messrs. Boyd, Son, & Co.
