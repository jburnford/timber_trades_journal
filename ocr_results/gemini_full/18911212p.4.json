J. T. Salvesen & Co., of Grangemouth, for £10, being the balance of freight for a voyage from Wyburg, Finland, to Grangemouth, reported in last week's Journal, the Sheriff has issued an interlocutor, in which he says that the case, while presented in the form of an action for payment of a balance of freight, was in reality a claim for damages. The freight was admitted, but the defenders, Messrs. Salvesen & Co., withheld the sum of £10 upon the following ground:—It appeared that in terms of the printed conditions in his charter-party the pursuer, Captain Rasmussen, master of the *Marie*, of Helsingborg, was taken bound to \"clear\" his ship with the charterers' agent (who happened to be the defenders), under a penalty of £10. He did not do this, but cleared with other agents, viz., Messrs. Fischer & Co. Hence it was contended that this penalty had been incurred, and that the defenders having paid the whole of the freight, with the exception of the above amount, ought to be assoilzied. The Sheriff was of opinion in the first place that the pursuer was to blame in ignoring the plain terms of his charter-party and failing to make any effort to find out the charterer's agent. How far precisely he was to blame, it was perhaps difficult to say without hearing his own story. But that there was fault he\n\nTELEGRAMS, \"ROBINSONS, GLASGOW.\" TELEPHONE No. 2003.\n*Robinson, Dunn, & Co.,*\nTIMBER IMPORTERS,\n*Partick, Glasgow.*\nSawing, Planing, and Moulding Mills at Partick and Temple.\nCreosoting Works at Temple.\n\nJAMES DONALDSON & SONS,\nTimber Merchants and Saw-millers,\nTAYPORT, (Also at LEVEN, FIFE.)\nEVERY DESCRIPTION OF BALTIC AND AMERICAN TIMBER.\n\nthought could not be doubted. But then the defenders were entirely free from blame? They were in the position of persons suing in an action of damages. They ought to have known that the pursuer was ignorant of their name, and also to have known the law relating to the time within which the clearance of a ship had to be effected. If the pursuer made no effort to seek them, there was an absence of effort on their part also. It was true that they had at once to the ship they might have found that the pursuer had been to them; but even an unsuccessful effort might make a difference in the position of a party to an action. Upon the whole, therefore, he considered that this was not a case in which to enforce the penalty, although it was right that the defenders should be paid for clearance, and he understood these fees had been already tendered. Awarded no expenses to either party.\n\nMR. WILLIAM STEELL, architect, son of the late Sir John Steell, has offered an oak tree for Inverleith Park, Edinburgh, which had a curious origin as to its growth. The tree, it is stated, was found in the crop of a wood pigeon. After having been kept for some time amongst water, it was transferred to the family garden of the Steells, in the South Side, where it has attained a considerable growth. The Parks Committee have accepted the tree, and directed the curator to have it removed to the North Park.\n\nINVERALLOCHY.—THE PROPOSED HARBOUR FOR THE VILLAGES OF ST. COMBS, CAIRNBULG, AND INVERALLOCHY.—The committee of these three villages has sent a petition to the Fishery Board for Scotland, through Mr. Gordon, of Cairness, asking that an engineer be sent to survey the coast at this part, and find out the most suitable place at which to build the proposed harbour. The committee offers to defray the expenses of the engineer. The Fishery Board will send one. It is stated that this course has been adopted on the advice of Mr. Boyd, Peterhead. The villagers are still quite keen on the proposed harbour. Many of the fishermen of Cairnbulg and Inverallochy are taking down their boats, with a view to prosecuting the fishing in them.\n\nMR.
