Shippers are very firm and are quoting stiff figures, yet the volume of business will have to increase if the advance is to be maintained, and should there be any falling off in the present demand, some slackening on the part of holders may be looked for. Bangkok timber has been going fairly well and making good way with the principal buyers of the kingdom, the superior quality of the wood lately imported having helped to establish a good impression.\nIt has to be borne in mind that cheaply purchased stocks are still on hand among dealers, and until these are cleared off there will be no decided upward movement.\nThe stock of planks is still excessive. Inquiries have been more numerous, but the few sales effected have had no appreciable influence on prices, which continue depressed.\n\nGAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nBAKER, WILLIAM, builder and contractor, Brockhill Lodge, the Wyche, Colwall, Herefordshire.—The following are scheduled as creditors of the above debtor :—\n£ s. d.\nBromley Garrard, Worcester ... ... ... 40 0 0\nBourne & Grove, Worcester ... ... ... 100 0 0\nClarke Arthur, London ... ... ... ... 160 0 0\nDavis I.

The examination was adjourned, and the debtor was ordered to prepare, in the meantime, a statement of his receipts and payments.\nDRAFFIN & SO.—This matter which has been adjourned several times by the Registrar, at the Manchester Bankruptcy Court, was again mentioned by the Official Receiver (Mr. C. J. Dibb) on Thursday, where he intimated that he did not propose to examine the younger debtor—who it will be remembered carried on business as a joiner and packing-case maker, at Manchester—further, and he thought the matter might now close. The Registrar consented, and the debtor afterwards signed the notes taken of his previous examinations.\nGREENWOOD, JAMES, builder, Maltby Street, Bermondsey, and 86, Cannon Street, E.C.—This case was noticed last week, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday before Mr. Brougham, Official Receiver. The debtor, trading as James Greenwood & Son, filed his petition on the 4th ult., returning his total liabilities at £12,380 4s. 9d., of which £5,541 14s. 7d. are expected to rank, and assets of the estimated value of £13,678 12s. 2d.

The Chairman said that Mr. R. J. Ward and Mr. J. J. Steer, accountants, had, upon the nomination of trade creditors for £2,200, been appointed as special managers. Two important contracts were on hand, and one with the Australian Meat Company was being proceeded with, as the special managers had reported that it could be carried through with benefit to the estate. The other contract was for the erection of a hospital at Bethnal Green, for £9,155. The debtor had already expended £6,094 upon it, and £5,000 further would be required for completion of the building. As it was considered that the operations could not be continued with advantage to the creditors, an arrangement had been made with the debtor's brother to take over the contract and pay £350 for the plant, &c., upon the works. On behalf of the debtor it was stated that no proposal could be made, having regard to the nature of the assets and the difficulty in realising them. The accounts showed a large surplus, and the estate if carefully realised would doubtless yield 20s. in the pound for the creditors. An adjudication of bankruptcy was accordingly resolved upon, and Messrs. Ward and Steer were appointed joint trustees of the estate, together with a committee of inspection consisting of Mr. Albert V. Raffety, Mr. J. Wiggins (T. & W. Farmiloe), Mr. J. Hooper (Doulton & Co.), Mr. J. T. Parrett (Francis & Co.), and Mr. John Greenwood. The public examination is fixed for January 14th.\nHEALING, FREDERICK, builder, Outwood.—This bankrupt was examined at the Wakefield Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday week. He said he commenced business on his own account in June, 1890, without capital. He had incurred liabilities amounting to £828 8s. 7d. He alleged his failure to have been caused by bad debts and a rise in wages. In making out a contract to build five houses for £350 for a Mr. Holmes, over which he lost £10, he did not make out any estimate of quantities, but was told by a man, named Wright, that it would pay him at that sum. Over a contract for seven houses at Stanley he was £128 to the bad. He lost £40 through the fall of some arches he had put up for a Mr. Philpot. He had built a cottage for a Mr. Hargreaves for £40. He claimed £19 from Mr. Hargreaves, but that gentleman said he did not owe him anything. He admitted having betted a little, but had not neglected his work to do so. The examination was finally adjourned for a month.\n\nTeak Timber and Rock Elm, first-class Yellow and Waney Pine Timber, and every description of Shipbuilding Wood.—Hoar & Brown.\n\nDECEMBER 12, 1891.\nordered out of the Bankruptcy Court. The Receiver said he had had to get out certain points, as it had been stated that the debtor was not very well off, and he had to sift the sums mentioned to see whether there was a very \"fishy\" transaction. He suggested that this should be done, and that a trustee should be appointed. Eventually Mr. Collins was mentioned as trustee, but as not a quorum of creditors was present, no motion could be passed. It was therefore decided to adjourn the meeting to enable sufficient creditors to be present to form a quorum. The following are the principal creditors interested :—\nBanks & Co., Aldershot ... ... ... ...\nChapple W., Aldershot ... ... ... ...\nFoster —, Aldershot ... ... ... ... ...\nHoward W., Lambeth ... ... ... ...\nKnight R., Aldershot ... ... ... ...\nLine & Son, Reading ... ... ... ...\nMesser & Co., Ltd., Reading ... ... ...\nMalcolm, Bunker, & Co., Aldershot ... ...\nMay & Son, Old Kent Road ... ... ...\nStevens Bros. & Co., Upper Thames Street ...\nWilliams W., Hammersmith ... ... ...\nPIERCY WM., joiner and builder, 27, Dale Street, York.—At the York Bankruptcy Court on Friday this debtor stated that he commenced in 1887 with £50 capital. He had no creditors, prior to the bankruptcy, and he presented a statement of affairs which was solvent; but the Official Receiver had to make him a bankrupt. His gross liabilities amounted to £1,173 13s. 11d., his building society's claim being £1,000. In the bankruptcy he had lost £173 13s. 11d. His failure to his was due to depreciation of capital. He had produced his receipts and payments for the time he had been in business, and he had received £11,925 and he said he could not explain how the receipts had been exceed the receipts by a large amount. The examination was further adjourned, and the debtor was ordered to prepare a cash statement.\nPURSELL & SON, builders, Stoke-on-Trent. Bar.—The public examination of these bankrupts came on for hearing at the Hanley Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Tennant, on Thursday week. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtors remarked that the debtors had commenced business with no capital, and never had any. They had had a ness beyond their earning power for the last teen years without capital, and no good could be done by people trading in that way. The debtors further stated that they had kept no books of account, and they did not know what their income and expenditure had been prior to, but they had only lived from hand to mouth, and had been correct in their business ties. The immediate cause of their bankruptcy petition was owing to an execution being levied upon their goods. Mr. J. H. Hawley, timber merchant, Maize Hill, Stoke, questioned the debtors as to the money they had received during the last few weeks, and the disposition of the money. The money had been purchased from the Co-operative Society, a man formerly in their employ having stated that they had made an arrangement with the business handed back to them, and that they had no expectation of paying for it. Mr. Henwood: I believe the arrangement was that after this little transaction was over\n\nHODGES, RICHARD, builder, Redruth. —This bankrupt was publicly examined on Saturday, at the Truro Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Chilcott. The Official Receiver reprimanded the debtor for not having filed the accounts ordered at his previous examination in time for him to go through them. The circumstances he must ask for a further adjournment. The examination was eventually adjourned until January.\nHUGHES, JOHN OWEN, builder and contractor, Dyffreyn Aled, Colwyn Bay.—This bankrupt came up for his public examination at the Bangor Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week. The summary of accounts disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £4,376. The debtor said his failure had been caused through a bad speculation in a block of houses built in Conway Road. After the debtor had been examined at some length respecting his transactions with a solicitor named Hignett, the examination was ordered to be closed, subject to the debtor filing a cash account.\nJOSE, RICHARD, builder, Truro.—At the Truro Bankruptcy Court on Saturday this bankrupt came up for his adjourned public examination. The Official Receiver said he must complain about the debtor having failed to file certain accounts. The examination was then adjourned, the debtor being again ordered to file the necessary accounts.\nNEWBOULT, WALTER, 102, Church Lane, Gorton, builder and contractor.—Deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors. Trustee, John T. Trotter, 27, Brazennose Street, Manchester. Dated 5th December, filed 8th December, 1891. Unsecured liabilities, £336 12s. 3d., estimated net assets £649 6s. 3d. The following are scheduled as creditors :—\nBass & Smith, Stoke-upon-Trent ... ... ... £90 0 0\nCasson & Co., Liverpool ... ... ... ... 20 0 0\nHoward Clavey, Ardwick Green ... ... ... 12 4 11\nHughes —, Oldham ... ... ... ... ... 16 0 0\nPlatt Bros., Openshaw ... ... ... ... 45 0 0\nRoberts —, Salford ... ... ... ... ... 12 19 6\nSmith & Son, Ardwick Green ... ... ... 15 0 0\nTaylor Jabez, Manchester ... ... ... ... 12 0 0\nPIERCY, WILLIAM, builder, 12, Lysons Road, Aldershot.—The Official Receiver has issued his report.—The statement of affairs discloses gross liabilities amounting to £2,112 3s. 2d., of which £895 7s. 2d. is due to unsecured creditors; to fully secured creditors £1,216 16s. The value of the securities being estimated at £1,420, thus showing a surplus of £203 4s., the assets are £464 12s., thus showing a deficiency of £430 15s. 2d. The debtor alleges his failure to have been caused by under-estimating all his contracts. The receiving order was made on a creditors petition on October 31st. Prior to 1889 the debtor was a carpenter at Aldershot, and in that year he commenced business on his own account without any capital. The debtor attributes his insolvency to his under-estimating his contracts. The first meeting of the creditors was held on Monday, at the offices of the Official Receiver for Guildford district, Railway Approach, London Bridge. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor said he had borrowed £150 from his sister. She lent him £100 in July last, same being paid by cheque drawn on the London and County Bank. He had entered into a written contract to build two houses for her, but he had not completed the houses. He should think he had put £350 worth of work into them, but she had advanced him £409 for them, although the contract price was only £400. The houses were still uncompleted. He stopped building them in September. The debtor was then\n\nMahogany and Cedar, Planks and Boards, and every description of Hardwood Lumber. Hoar & Brown, West India Docks, E. Telephone 5105.",
