DECEMBER 19, 1891.

ING & BARRY,
WOOD SAW-MILLS, DUNDEE.

The weather has been excessively wet and stormy during the past week, and has recently prevailed does not improve matters. Messrs. A. Garland & Co. held their usual public sale on Tuesday, 15th inst., in their Railway Yard, Edinburgh. The catalogue of American and Baltic timber, deals &c., was a good one, but the character of the weather was such that it was impossible to expect buyers to expose themselves at an auction in the open air at this season of the year. The sale was therefore, but a small attendance, and as the sellers contented themselves with small lots, buyers present an opportunity of providing themselves with any special lots required. We closed the proceedings as early as possible. Under the circumstances no special prices can be noted.
We hear that a firm of London agents has been inquiring about this district during the past week with a view to open up business for the sale of pitch pine, but the high prices demanded have, we understand, stood in the way.

LIGHTING OF HOUSES.
AT a meeting of the Dundee Institute of Architecture, Art, and Civil Engineering, held in the Art Room, Dundee, on the 10th inst.—Mr. Charles Ower (president) in the chair, and amongst those present were Mr. Frank W. Young, Mr. W. D. M'Laren, ex-Bailie M'Culloch, Mr. George C. Keiller, Mr. Leslie Ower, Mr. James Thomson, Mr. Charles Kerr, Captain Newton, and Mr. James Henderson. Mr. Ogilvie explained how the wire, heated by the electric current, gave off light, but at the same time the heat of certain metals, would melt them. He then demonstrated the manner in which an electric lamp gave out light. He said that in the lamp being made of carbon, and when the current was passing through it during the process particles of the carbon were thrown off, and in time the carbon became thinner and thinner until it wore out. The average life of a lamp was about 1,000 hours burning. By means of diagrams on a large blackboard with coloured chalks Mr. Ogilvie represented how electricity could be introduced in houses. The two wires were brought into the house, the one being at an electrical pressure of 100 volts above the other. These two wires were connected by a wire passing through the lamp, which was the means the electric current was passed, and the arrangements for the distribution of the current were, he said, of importance. The material of the electric current was of copper, or an alloy of copper, and to prevent electricity escaping from one wire to another or into the material of the wall, the copper wire was entirely surrounded by some substance which offered great resistance to the flow of electricity. The manner in which wires could be carried over a room was then detailed, and the use of the switch for turning on and off the current was fully explained, a switch being handed round among the audience to clearly show how it worked. It was usual also to have a small piece of copper which formed part of the whole circuit which was of a substance easily melted. The object of this was to prevent any accident occurring in the event of some unforeseen contact between the two wires. This small piece of wire prevented the possibility of such an accident, as should any mishap come to pass the wire fused, and the whole connection were rendered harmless. The lecturer at the close referred to the cost of electric light, especially as compared with the cost of gas, and by means of diagrams he demonstrated how the different prices might be arrived at and compared. He said that gas was cheaper than electricity, but the use of the latter was very much more pleasant, as more gas was used than was absolutely required. A switch provided in a convenient place at the door of each room would enable one to turn the electric light on or off as desired. The great qualification of electric light, however, as compared with gas, was that it did not affect the chemical condition of the air. Electricity heated the air, but did not burn it or vitiate it in any way, and the vitiation of the air by gas was the very thing which was to be counterbalanced in the additional price of electric lighting. A number of questions were then asked by various members, and answered by the lecturer. On the motion of Mr. F. W. Young, seconded by ex-Bailie M'Culloch, a hearty vote of thanks was awarded to Mr. Ogilvie, and a similar compliment having been paid to the Chairman the proceedings terminated.
