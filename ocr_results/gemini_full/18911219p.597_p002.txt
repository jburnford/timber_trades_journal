COOK, FRANK JOSHUA, coachbuilder and wheelwright, Headleigh.—An application for the discharge of this bankrupt, on Thursday week, was made at the Ipswich Bankruptcy Court. The Official Receiver stated that the debtor’s statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £842, and assets estimated at £56. A first and final dividend of 1s. in the pound had been paid. The debtor commenced business without any capital and lost £30 in book debts, and the remainder in being surety for his father in respect of moneys from which he had received no benefit. He became surety altogether for as much as £700. As he had but a small business he could have had no expectation of meeting these liabilities, and while they were hanging over him he traded with creditors who knew nothing about them. Mr. Moseley, who appeared for the debtor, in reply to the Official Receiver’s report, said the bankrupt would be called upon as surety, and what he had done was certainly not in the nature of a speculation. Finally his Honour suspended the debtor’s discharge for three months.

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
COOPER, MATTHEW JONATHAN, 12, Clarkson Street, Ipswich.—The public examination of the above debtor was held at the Ipswich Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week. In reply to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor said he commenced business forty-five years ago, in King Street, Ipswich. He was now seventy-nine years of age. About eighteen years ago he was compelled to arrange privately with his creditors, but in a short time recovered his position, and he made a profit of £1,200 by the sale of his property; however, in three years he lost £800 of that through betting and becoming surety. The debtor was questioned at some length respecting an amount of £30 scheduled as “money lent,” from which it appeared that he had paid £6 per year on this amount for seven years, making £42 in all, with the principal still unpaid. In another case he was charged 40 per cent., and for a third loan of 50s. he had paid thirteen instalments of 5s. each. The Registrar said that some of the creditors were scheduled who would never have expected the money, and the Official Receiver stated that only one proof had been sent in. The debtor created considerable surprise by incidentally informing the Court that he had had twenty-seven children—twenty by his first wife and seven by the second. The debtor was thereupon allowed to pass his examination.

Trustee, George Williamson, 37, Brown Street, Manchester (C.A.). Dated 7th December, 1891. Filed 9th December, 1891.

DECEMBER 19, 1891.
DEACON, JAMES, builder, Reading.—The public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Reading Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday week, before Judge Lushington. The statement of affairs filed by bankrupt showed liabilities amounting to £750 14s. 10d., and assets estimated to produce £362 18s. 4d. The debtor said he had been in business on his own account in Reading for two or three years. He had no capital of his own when he commenced business, and he had introduced none since then. He had built three houses in Beecham Road, three in Waverley Road, and two in Swansea Road, which were sold. He was now engaged as foreman to a Mr. Fidler, having entered his service last month. He called a meeting of his creditors in November, at which he offered a composition of 5s. in the pound, but the matter fell through owing to Messrs. Messer & Co. refusing to accept it. He had kept no books of account, as he had a bad memory. He opened a banking account in September. The whole of his property was freehold, except a few houses in Swansea Road. He estimated that his properties would produce a surplus of £261. A portion of the scaffolding on his premises belonged to him, and the remainder to Mr. Fidler. He was of opinion that his portion of the scaffolding was worth £25. The examination was finally ordered to be adjourned.

HAWKINS, WILLIAM, packing case manufacturer, Millstone Lane, Leinster.—An application was made at the Leinster County Court, on Tuesday, on behalf of the above debtor, for an order to approve of a composition of 8s. 6d. in the pound, payable by three instalments in nine months. Mr. Hincks appeared for the debtor, said the debtor’s statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £912 5s. 10d. and assets estimated to produce £558 6s. 1d. The Official Receiver reported that the composition was favourable, and the resolution to accept it was unanimous. Mr. E. P. Steeds, the trustee under the bankruptcy, said the debtor’s conduct had been perfectly satisfactory. The committee of inspection had investigated certain matters, and found them satisfactory. He further stated that the estate had not realised anything like the debtor had offered. Finally, his Honour decided to approve of the composition.

HOUGHTON, HARRIET, 21, Sloane Street, S.W.—This bankrupt applied on Friday for an order of discharge. It appeared that in 1886 she was assigned to her son, Henry Houghton (who was adjudged bankrupt in February, 1890), the late husband’s business formerly carried on by her husband, in consideration of her son making her an allowance of 30s. per week. Mrs. Houghton failed in February, 1890, her liabilities expected to rank being returned at £117 19s. 1d., and assets which have yielded a first and final dividend of 4s. 5d. in the pound. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had contracted debts without reasonable expectation of being able to pay them, and on that ground Mr. Registrar Brougham suspended the order of discharge for twenty-four months from March 27th, 1890, the date of the passing of the public examination.

LANGTON, THOMAS, mahogany merchant’s clerk, 7, Altenberg Gardens, Clapham, S.W.—The adjudication in this case was made in June, 1880, the petitioning creditors being Messrs. Raffety, Thornton, & Co., timber merchants, and the bankrupt applied last week for his order of discharge under the provisions of the Bankruptcy (Discharge and Closure) Act. The liabilities were returned in the statement of affairs at £5,612 8s. 7d. and assets £74 10s. 6d. There was no opposition, and the discharge was granted.

LING, JAMES, trading as Jefferies & Ling, cricket bat manufacturers, Lower Wood Street, Woolwich, residing at “Homeleigh,” Cage Lane, Plumstead.—This bankrupt’s application for discharge was heard before his Honour Judge Bristow, at the Greenwich Bankruptcy Court, last week, when the Official Receiver, Mr. A. Mackintosh, appeared in person and opposed. The bankrupt did not appear to have committed any misdemeanour, but under Section 8 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1890, it was reported that the bankrupt’s assets were of a less value than 10s. in the pound, that he had not kept proper books, that he had contributed to his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation, and that he had contracted debts which he had no reasonable ground of being able to pay. His Honour granted the discharge, but suspended it for two years.

PIERCY, WILLIAM, B., builder, Shrewsbury Road, Aldershot.—The adjourned first meeting of creditors under this bankruptcy was held on Monday, at the offices of the Official Receiver, Railway Approach, Guildford, under the presidency of the Deputy-Receiver. The debtor’s statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £1,273 13s. 1d., of which £895 7s. 2d. was expected to rank against the estate for dividend, the assets were estimated to produce £150, thus showing a deficiency of £745 7s. 2d. The Official Receiver said it was his opinion that it was necessary to have a trustee, as he would have to make a thorough investigation of the books (said the Official Receiver). Since the receiving order he had examined the debtor, and found that a mortgage given to her sister for £150 was a fraudulent preference. He did not wish to make public the reasons, but when she appeared for his examination in Court he should be questioned upon oath. He had no doubt that there was a surplus dividend for the creditors, and they would no doubt get it when a trustee was appointed. He had been informed that at the private meeting the debtor had received £150 from his sister, but the solicitor said he had advised him that he understood he had proved for the amount. The Official Receiver said the matter had been thoroughly gone into by the solicitor for the creditors said that there were great discrepancies between the statements made at the private meeting by the debtor, and what he now wished to make out. The Official Receiver stated that under the circumstances the statements made at a private meeting of creditors, and sworn under oath, were good evidence in a court of law. He had no doubt that an affidavit would be forthcoming from creditors respecting the statements made at the private meeting. A proposition was made that Mr. Ernest Collins, public accountant, Coleman Street, London, be appointed trustee, but another creditor thought it would be better to have a local man. It was suggested Mr. Knight, who was a large creditor, should act in the matter. For some reason, ever, as Mr. Knight did not wish to act, it was unanimously resolved that Mr. Ernest Collins as trustee, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection. The amount of the trustee’s guarantee bond was fixed at £300.

The Official Receiver (Mr. H. C. Damant) and Mr. Loxley (for the Board of Trade) opposed. Mr. Percy T. Pearce for Mr. [?]
