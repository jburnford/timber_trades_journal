FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

ABBOTT, FRANCIS W., builder, Marwood and Barnstaple.-At the Barnstaple Bankruptcy Court, last week, before Judge Paterson, this bankrupt applied for his discharge. The Official Receiver, Mr. Philpot, in his report states that the bankruptcy took place in March, 1889, the debtor's liabilities amounting to £234 10s. 10d., and his assets amounted to £4, which was not enough to pay the costs by £1 4s. The bankrupt commenced business in 1882, with a capital of £26. He attributed his insolvency to illness in his family, loss on contracts, and the loss of a horse. He had kept no books of account, and he discovered his insolvency about six months before he filed his petition. He continued to trade after he knew he was insolvent. Within three months of filing his petition he gave an undue preference to Messrs. Sander & Smith, who were creditors. On these grounds the Official Receiver opposed the discharge. Mr. Seldon, who appeared on behalf of the debtor, explained his Honour the preference referred to. He said that about a month before the bankruptcy the debtor transferred £29, owing to him from Mr. Tucker, to Messrs. Sander & Smith, who had been pressing the debtor for some time. Messrs. Sander & Smith were very large creditors, and this £20 was only a small portion of their debt. It was done not for the purpose of preferring these creditors, but in order to get further materials to continue the contract. His Honour granted the discharge, but suspended it for six months.

The debtor states that for about eleven years prior to September, 1890, he carried on business as a builder at Leyton, and that since that date he has acted as manager to his son and another person. He attributes his insolvency to liabilities incurred mostly during the years 1884 and 1885 in respect of building speculations at Leyton and Wanstead. The debtor filed his petition on December 7th, and the first meeting of his creditors was held on Tuesday, before Mr. Gray, Assistant Receiver. Accounts were furnished showing unsecured debts £2,773 11s. 7d., and debts fully secured £2,181, with assets nil. In the absence of a quorum of creditors no resolution was passed, and the Official Receiver will continue to act as trustee under the proceedings.

EMIGRATION.-The January circulars of the Emigrants' Information Office report :-That many carpenters and plumbers in Queensland have been out of work. In Western Australia there is a demand for a limited number of men in the building trade.

COAL IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE.-A discovery of immense importance has been made in Mid-Northamptonshire. Borings for minerals in the Thrapston district have resulted in proving the existence of valuable seams of coal, being apparently an extension of the great Midland coalfield, and covering a wide area.
