The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\n\nZetland Hotel, the chairman gave the toast of “The Firm of Brownlee & Co.,” and in doing so gave statistics of the Grangemouth branch of the business.\nHe said they had had an exceedingly busy year in the saw-mill, the workmen had been employed full time all through and not infrequently had been called on for overtime, and for the resumption of business after the holidays a considerable bulk of orders were in hand and the prospects were quite as bright for a continuation of the same condition as had been experienced throughout the past year.\nHe next referred to the Mutual Aid Society, of which, the workmen had either reaped or seen the advantages.\nHe was glad the funds were in a satisfactory condition.\nMr. David Weston, Glasgow, in replying, conveyed the best wishes of the firm, none of whom, he was sorry to say could find it possible to meet them on this occasion, the firm attached great importance to the maintenance of the best relationship between them and their servants in every department, and this, to some extent contributed to the ever increasing business which they experienced as passing through their hands—other toasts included “The Customers,” which was replied to by Mr. Forgie, and in doing so he could only eulogize the firm for the high reputation they had for the honourable dealings which characterised every transaction he had with them as a firm, and he knew he was only expressing the experience of the large and wide range of customers which the firm had the pleasure to supply.\n“The Railway Companies” was replied to by Mr. Maitland, agent of the N.B. Railway.\nThe “Strangers,” replied to by Mr. Scott, the “Workmen,” the Manager,” the “Ladies,” and other toasts, were given and replied to by Messrs.
