LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
CUSTOM OF PORT CASE AT DUNDEE.
"Proof" has been led in the Dundee Small Debt Court in an action in which James Cormack, Leith, owner of the steamship Penelope, sued John Jessiman, timber merchant, Dundee, for payment of £4 12s. 3d., being the expense of taking a quantity of deals, whitewood, and laths from alongside that ship and piling them on the wharf. The defender pleaded that he had no notice of the arrival of the ship, and had no opportunity to do the work himself ; and also that the discharge of the vessel was only intermittent, and that the amount was overcharged. After hearing evidence, the Sheriff said it seemed to him that if the question were to be fairly settled between shippers and consignees, it would have to be done by some readjustment of the terms of bills of lading and of charter-parties. The Sheriff gave decree for half the sum sued for—namely, £2 6s. 1½d., with 7s. 6d. for expenses.

DAMAGE TO A NURSERY.
In the Sheriff Court at Stranraer, Garlies Mitchell, nurseryman, sued Alexander Anthony M'Master, New Luce, for £29, restricted to £12, for damage to his nursery grounds. Mr. McMaster was the shooting tenant on the estate of Sheuchan for last season and the pursuer's nurseries formed part of the estate. On the 24th of September last the defender and party were shooting on the nursery, and the pursuer alleged that damage was done by them to the beds of Dollybrats, Portugal laurel, larch, &c. Proof was led at great length at three successive diets.

BRANCH YARD AT NEWBURGH.

JANUARY 2, 1892.

Sheriff Watson has given his decision, finding that the damage was done by the defender and his party, and assessing the damage at £12, the sum sued for, with expenses. Mr. Belford appeared for the pursuer, and Mr. Adair for the defender. The defender's agent gave notice of appeal, under section 31 of the Small Debt Amendment Act.

TIMBER DISCHARGE AND FREIGHT CUSTOM.
Sheriff Guthrie, in the Glasgow Sheriff Court, has given judgment in two actions, both raised by Abraham Thorsen, master, and as representing the owners of, the Norwegian barque Theodor Korner and Lie and Co., shipbrokers, their mandatories, one against M'Dowall & Nielsen, timber merchants and brokers, 88, St. Vincent-street, and the other against the same firm, and Mr. S. Wright, writer, 150, St. Vincent-street. In the first-mentioned action £30 was claimed as demurrage, but the Sheriff finds that the detention of the barque Theodor Korner was caused by the pursuers' own act, and not by the defenders, whom he therefore assoilzies, with expenses. In the other action £56 4s. 7d. was claimed, being balance of freight on deals alleged to be due by the defenders. The Sheriff, in this case, finds that the pursuers, as owners of the goods, failed to deliver the deals in like good order and condition at the port of Glasgow as contracted for ; that the deals were damaged to the amount of £40, and to that extent sustains the defences, and decerns in favour of the pursuers for the admitted balance of freight due, namely £16 4s. 7d. His Lordship allows the defenders expenses.
