JANUARY 9, 1892.\n\nGAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nANSELL, ARCHIBALD, Billericay, builder and contractor.—Absolute assignment of debtor's estate to said assignee in trust for one Charles Ansell, of 14, Edward Street, York Road, Lambeth, builder, in consideration of agreement by him to pay to debtor's creditors a composition of 6s. in the pound within three months from date hereof. Trustee and assignee: Alfred C. Cronin, 22, Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, solicitor. Dated 1st January, 1892. Filed 5th January, 1892. Unsecured liabilities, £2,651 7s. 11d.; estimated net assets, £762 19s. The following are scheduled as creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nAnsell Aubrey, London ... ... ... 38 6 8\nAnsell Charles, Lambeth, London ... ... 1,458 5 8\nAnsell H. G., Billericay... ... ... 74 4 5\nBray & Co., Nottingham ... ... ... 41 0 8\nCrow & Son, London ... ... ... 269 0 0\nFormby's Cement Works Company, London 44 14 5\nMeredith H., London ... ... ... 63 3 0\nNix W., Billericay ... ... ... 48 1 6\nStanton & Co., King's Lynn ... ... 24 14 2\nWebster & Co., Eccleshill ... ... 44 4 6\n\nBARRETT, PAUL, cabinet-maker, 146, Earl's Court Road, and Warwick Road, W.—This failure occurred in August last, the debtor returning his gross liabilities at £5,336, of which £2,532 were unsecured, and assets £1,690. A scheme providing for the payment of a composition of 10s. in the pound and the withdrawal of certain claims was accepted by the creditors, but was not approved by the Court, and the debtor was thereupon adjudged bankrupt. A meeting for the appointment of a trustee and committee of inspection was now held before Mr. Wreford, senior Official Receiver. Mr. R. C. Moore, accountant, Palmerston Buildings, E.C., was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection, consisting of Messrs. Lidgate, Williams, and Leney.\n\nBEETESRWOTH, G. H. (trading as G. Mears & Co.), builder, late of Avenue Road, New Southgate, N.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Giffard, on Tuesday, and a receiving order was made under a creditor's petition. The debtor states that he left New Southgate about three months since. He had been building there, and also at New Barnet, and the houses were mortgaged. The liabilities were estimated at about £500 or £600.\n\nELAND, MATTHEW, joiner and builder, It. Sunfield, Stanningley, and residing at Backbury Terrace, Old Road, Farsley.—The statutory meeting of the creditors under this bankruptcy took place at the offices of the Official Receiver. The summary of accounts showed liabilities amounting to £1,005 11s 6d., and assets estimated to produce £171 6s 4d., thus leaving a deficiency amounting to £834 5s. 2d. The debtor alleged his failure to have been caused by losses on contracts. It appeared that the debtor commenced as a joiner and builder, at Farsley, in 1876. He began with a capital of £50, and had since borrowed £370. Since 1887 he had carried out contracts to the extent of about £4,000, but many of them had been a financial loss to him. The immediate cause of the debtor filing his petition was in consequence of an execution being levied upon his effects on the 10th ult. As the debtor had no offer of composition to submit to the creditors it was decided to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration. The following are scheduled as creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBeecroft & Wightman, Bradford ... ... 278 7 2\nBrown & Sons, Luton ... ... ... 114 0 0\nCuthbert Robert, Leeds... ... ... 56 1 2\nGriggs & Co., Loughborough ... ... 16 14 0\nHewitson & Lambert, Hull ... ... 79 4 0\nHudson & Co., Leeds ... ... ... 51 1 2\nWilson E. & Co., Bradford ... ... 43 0 0\n\nHIBBETT, EDWARD, builder, Colsterworth, Lincs.—The Official Receiver for the Nottingham district has issued particulars under this bankruptcy. The statement of affairs disclosed liabilities amounting to £454 16s. 11d. and assets estimated to produce £133 8s. 7d, and which, after deducting the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaves net assets at £129 8s. 9d., and a deficiency of £325 8s. 4d. The report and observations of the Official Receiver are as follows:—The debtor, who has been adjudicated bankrupt on his own petition, states he commenced business as a builder twelve years ago with a capital of\n\n---\nImported Teak Planks, in all thicknesses and widths, are sold by Hoar & Brown, East Wood Wharf, West India Docks, E. Telegrams— \"Hornbeam, London.\" Telephone 5105.\n\nand continued that business until he was sold up by the Sheriff on an execution shortly before he filed his petition. Application has been made to the Sheriff for the proceeds of the execution to be handed over to me. The debtor states the cause of his insolvency to be illness through a broken leg, and losses in trade. The debtor has kept a ledger but no cash book, nor any account that would show a profit and loss account, or trade expenses, and for household or personal expenses, the ledger simply containing accounts against persons for work done. The debtor had a one-sixth interest in property at Colsterworth, which property has lately been sold for £950, but is subject to a mortgage of £700 and interest for £60, subject to a prior charge thereon for £22 and interest; there can be nothing coming to the estate from this source.\n\nKING, JOSEPH, builder, late Rudgwick, Sussex.—An application was made at the Bankruptcy Court on Friday last before Judge Martineau, for the release of this debtor from custody. Mr. Pope, on behalf of the bankrupt, said that the debtor was arrested on December 24th as an absconding bankrupt; however, he begged leave to put in an affidavit by debtor's daughter, who said that on November 10th her father moved to St. Ann's Villa, Glenville Road, Norbiton, and had been residing there ever since. She further stated that his address had been given to one of his creditors. Mr. Pope submitted that there was nothing to show the proceedings had ever come under debtor's notice. A notice had not been served upon him personally, but an advertisement had been inserted in a paper that did not circulate in Norbiton. Finally, his Honour granted an order for the debtor's release, on condition that he obtained sureties for £25.\n\nLEWINGTON, G. R., boatbuilder, Rotherhithe Street, S.E.—The first meeting of creditors was held in this case last week, before Mr. Chapman, Assistant Receiver. The debtor, who has traded since September, 1889, returns his debts at £355 9s, and assets at £27 10s., the following being creditors for goods supplied:—\n£ s. d.\nThomas & Co., London ... ... ... 30 0 0\nBolton & Haywood, London ... ... 48 0 9\nJ. J., London ... ... ... ... 20 0 7\nPeabody & Co., London ... ... ... 42 14 1\nPinchin B. & Son, Lewisham Bridge ... 22 5 0\nScripps, Collins, & Co., Rotherhithe ... 21 0 7\nWhittington H. M., London ... ... 60 0 0\nYoung & Knight, London ... ... 20 8 0\nZucker R. & Son, London ... ... 50 4 2\nIt was stated that the assets had realised £25 or £70, and a small sum further might be received. No resolution was passed, and the Official Receiver will continue to act as trustee under the bankruptcy.\n\nLEWIS, DAVID WILLIAM, & HENRY DAVID LEWIS, builders, Victoria Road North, Southsea.—The statement of affairs herein shows gross liabilities £96,709 12s. 5d., to unsecured creditors £8,390 12s. 5d., assets £21,462 2s. 2d. The alleged causes of failure are, loss on contracts for sewerage repairs at Richmond, loss on unlet property, and repairs. The Official Receiver's observations are:—The bankrupts, who filed their own petition, have only been in partnership about three or four months. The father commenced business about twenty-four years ago, without capital. For the past twenty-one or twenty-two years he states he has been financed by the Portsea Island Building Society, who are shown as fully secured creditors for £51,481 2s. 9d. The estimated value of the securities held against this sum is £49,597 11s. 3d. The building society are also shown as partly secured for an overdraft amounting to £30,799 18s. 3d., after deducting an account per contra for repairs. The value of the securities held against this overdraft is stated to be £6,099 1s. 1d., the securities consisting of second mortgage to other persons, the surplus value of which is stated at £3 104 2s. 1d., and a first charge upon building land in Angerstein Road and North End Avenue, North End, and Orchard Road, Southsea, valued at £2,695 the net amount unsecured under this head being £24 700 16s. 2d. On the 18th September last, certain book debts and balances due upon unfinished contracts were assigned to the society, but no action was taken by the society in giving notice to any of the parties, excepting the local authorities at Richmond in respect of a contract for sewage, which was estimated to show a balance of £3,000 in favour of the bankrupts. The Richmond Board of Works repudiate any liability under this contract. When the bankrupt, David William Lewis, was first financed by the Building Society, he states that it was simply a speculative building. The accounts do not appear to have been settled between the parties at any time; the bankrupts state that they have never been rendered, and the figures given, which are taken from the Building Society, have been adopted with this qualification. The bankrupts' books do not contain any material from which their position at any period of their trading can be ascertained, but there is little doubt that the large deficiency now shown has been growing during the whole time, although the losses which have resulted from the Richmond contracts have no doubt been very heavy. In the deficiency account the sum of £6,776 is alleged to represent the loss in trading during the past two years.\n\nMATTERFACE, THOMAS, cabinet-maker, Teignmouth.—The above-named bankrupt came up for his public examination at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Dawe, on Thursday last week. The debtor's statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £167 7s. 1d., and assets estimated at £23 6s. 7d. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor said his goods were distrained upon early in the year, and the stock was sold under the hammer for £28, although it was really worth £97. He found that he was in a state of insolvency in April last, but he continued to trade, hoping to recover his position. The examination was ordered to be closed.\n\nSCOTT, WILLIAM, builder, Heatherlands, near Poole, Dorsetshire.—Under this failure the following are scheduled as creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBagg & Frampton, Bournemouth East ... 228 0 0\nBradley & Co., London ... ... ... 26 16 6\nColes A. C., Bournemouth ... ... 15 0 0\nGriffiths Brothers & Co., London ... ... 100 6 0\nGarrard R. & Co., London ... ... 13 2 6\nLoader & Son, Bournemouth ... ... 30 0 0\nLawson G. J., Bournemouth ... ... 20 12 9\nMatthews C. H., Wolverhampton ... 40 10 8\nMorris & Co., Poole ... ... ... 75 0 0\nMay & Hassell, Poole ... ... ... 95 19 10\nOsmond W., Poole ... ... ... 47 0 0\nPoole Baltic and Quebec Timber Company, Poole ... ... ... ... ... 55 0 0\nSharp, Jones, & Co., Poole ... ... 13 13 8\nTurner J., Fordingbridge ... ... 4 15 0\n\nSIBLEY, THOMAS, builder, Ryde, Isle of Wight.—The summary of this debtor's statement of affairs shows gross liabilities amounting to £900 14s. 7d., of which is expected to rank £489 19s. 7d. There is a deficiency of £466. The debtor alleges his causes of failure to be \"illness, slackness of business, depreciation in value of property, and the action brought against me by the executrix of W. Knott to recover £200 on a cheque for which I received no consideration.\" The Official Receiver's observations were:—The receiving order was made on the petition of a creditor filed 14th May last. The debtor commenced business at a builder at Ryde about forty years ago, and continued to trade there until two years since, when his son purchased from him the stock and book debts. The only asset returned by the debtor in his statement of affairs is the equity of redemption of Havelock Lodge, in which the debtor and his son reside, and which the debtor estimates to be worth £39. The furniture and effects in Havelock Lodge are claimed by the debtor's son and another relative. At the date of the receiving order several judgments had been obtained against the debtor. In 1879 the debtor made a private arrangement with his creditors, paying them 5s. in the pound, and in 1882 he filed a petition for liquidation, under which a dividend of 3s. 6d. in the pound was paid, the debtor not obtaining the discharge. The debtor has not kept a cash book, nor filed a proper account of his insolvency, but attributes his insolvency principally to depreciation in value of properties of which he had been possessed, and which at different times he had sold.\n\nSLATER, FREDERICK, builder, Derby.—At the Derby Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday, Mr. Stanger, who appeared for the trustee, said it was a matter in which two witnesses were summoned for examination before the Registrar. The two gentlemen were being examined, when objection was made from time to time to various questions, and by the advice of their solicitor they refused to answer them. Every one of them was on a question bore on a matter which was pending in the Court. It was allowed by the Registrar, but the witnesses refusing to answer,\n\n---\nTeak Timber and Rock Elm, first-class Yellow and Waney Pine Timber, and every description of Shipbuilding Wood.—Hoar & Brown.\n\nJANUARY 9, 1892.\n\nHUTCHINS & CO.,\n115, Dearborn Street, Chicago.\nREAL ESTATE DEALERS AND OWNERS OF\nOriginal Forests of\nPRICE FROM $1.00 TO $2.00 PER ACRE.\nCABINET WOODS.\n\nthe matter was referred to his Honour to decide. The point on behalf of the trustee was as to whether any question to which the same objections could be put ought to be answered. The matter pending was that Messrs. Alton & Co., who were creditors, tendered a proof in this bankruptcy amounting to £988, and that proof was registered by the trustee, whereupon Messrs. Alton gave notice of motion to reverse the decision. The amount as claimed, was for damages at the rate of £5 per day for 174 days, under a contract between Slater & Alton for the erection of certain maltings, which were to be completed within twenty weeks from December 23rd, 1889, but which was not completed until February 25th, 1891. Messrs. Alton agreed to extend the time for erection twelve weeks, owing to some difficulty in getting the plans passed by the local authorities, and owing to the state of the weather, and the date was therefore taken from May 14th, 1890. Then there was the added the amount claimed for defective work, £20, making a total sum of £890. After giving the estate credit for the balance of account owing to the said Slater for extras, £501 13s. 6d., the balance left was £388 6s. 6d., and this was the proof was rejected by the trustee. The reason the proof was rejected was that there was no such contract. A great question would arise as to whether the delay was occasioned by the default of the bankrupt, or by the amount of extras, or by the failure on the part of the architect to satisfy the authorities with regard to the plans. He admitted that the questions were put with reference to this motion, and it was of the greatest importance to the creditors that the truth should be known, and the only persons who could give this evidence were the two witnesses, Alton and Hardy, as the bankrupt had absconded. They wished to see the letters that had passed between Messrs. Alton and the bankrupt, and between Messrs. Alton and the borough surveyor. The interests of the creditors would be seriously prejudiced if they did not have this information. Mr. Yardley Lee, on behalf of the witnesses, said the trustee had mistaken the course he ought to adopt. He considered it would suit him better to investigate the matter before the Registrar instead of in the Court. The trustee wanted them to show their hand before his own investigations, and when that was done, and they intended to claim against the estate, he would have said: \"I will cross-examine you, and have all the advantages to be gained thereby, with none of the disadvantages.\" Finally, his Honour, in giving judgment, said:—Is it right, having regard to the trustee's position in the first instance, and to the position of the parties which had been created by the action of the trustee, that the trustee should now attempt to obtain further evidence, to see\n\nPOWER.\n\n---\nMahogany and Walnut Logs, Planks and Boards, Whitewood, Oak, &c., and every description of Hardwood Lumber.—Hoar & Brown, West India Docks, E.
