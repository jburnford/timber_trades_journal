yellow pine was slow of sale, but owing to the scarcity of first-class Quebec pine deals, the demand should be quickened. Pitch Pine—The consumption was large, and prices are now on the upward grade. Mahogany—This staple sold well throughout the year. The direct import from abroad is limited, large lines being brought coastwise of which no record is kept. Teak—The recent heavy stocks are wearing down, and the price is going up. Deals—First, second, and third yellow pine sold freely at advancing rates. Fourths and low port pine, being heavier in stock, have not participated to the same extent in the rise. Red pine and spruce are scarce and now sell at enhanced prices.
Freights from Quebec to Clyde opened at 17s. for timber and 45s. for deals, and closed at 20s. per load and 70s. per St. Petersburg standard.
The tables show an excess in the imports as compared with last year in each item except in the staples of birch, pitch pine, wainscot oak, teak, greenheart, and deals, but then, the import of 1890 was much under the average. The consumption of all descriptions of timber is larger in 1891 than the previous year, except in birch, ash, greenheart, and teak. The stocks are light, except of walnut, hickory, whitewood, and greenheart; the decreased quantities of yellow, red, and pitch pines, also of oak and deals, are remarkable.

SANDEND.—It is proposed to construct a new harbour at Sandend. The cost is estimated at £500.

MESSRS. LITTLE & BALLANTYNE, of the Royal Seed and Nursery Establishment, Carlisle, have issued a new garden-seed catalogue for 1892. Like all their publications, it is well got up, and will be of great service to all horticulturists, and to those who take an interest in gardening. The firm’s list of forest trees, which was published in November, can still be had on application.

FIRE AT AIRDRIE.—At noon on Thursday a fire broke out in the extensive woodyard of Messrs. William Shanks & Son, Frithfield, Airdrie, and in a short time the whole building was in a mass of flames, the efforts of the fire brigade proving almost ineffective in subduing the outbreak. The yard is surrounded on all sides by very valuable property, and the Airdrie Gas Works form the southern boundary on the premises, but fortunately the wind was blowing to the north, and the gas-works were not therefore in immediate danger. There appeared to be little hope of saving the saw-mills, where steam was blown off the boilers to prevent explosion.

DUNDEE IN 1891.—During the year the general trade of the Dundee district has been in a fairly prosperous state, and whilst there has been an absence of any special development of activity in any department, still the position has been well maintained. Producers here have had to struggle constantly against a variety of adverse circumstances to a greater extent than usual, and when these are remembered and considered, it is satisfactory to think that if there has not been witnessed any great expansion in the volume of trade, yet Dundee has been able to compete successfully in maintaining its prominent position without incurring loss either of credit or connections.

JANUARY 9, 1892.
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
CUSTOM OF PORT CASE.
DUNDEE.
Sheriff Guthrie has decided two cases of claim and counter-claim, on the discharge of a timber cargo at Glasgow, "according to the custom of the port." Of all vessels that of discharging as customary is a thorny palm. In the first suit Captain Theodor, of the Norwegian barque Theodor Korner, claimed £36 as demurrage, and £60 4s. 7d., which was allowed, balance of freight. Messrs. M'Dowall & Neilson, timber merchants, together £52 4s. 7d., in consequence of delay in unloading and freight. The merchants were consignees of a cargo of deals, and were empowered to order the vessel, in terms of charter-party, to any place they deemed fit. The barque was in the Clyde, and a correspondence was carried on with reference to delivery of the timber at Greenock. No amicable arrangement was arrived at, and a berth was assigned for her in the Clyde at Yorkhill Wharf, about the filthiest sewerage part of the river. It was usual, said Mr. Guthrie, for timber-laden vessels to discharge at Greenock or Port Glasgow, in the vicinity of the timber ponds; and the consignees of the Theodor Korner wished the master of that vessel to wait at Greenock till instructions could be sent, but, having been ordered to Glasgow, he took his ship up there. Through loss of time, it was alleged, every endeavour to induce the master to discharge at Greenock, the berthing accommodation at the Queen's Dock was occupied, and the vessel was put to a berth near the foreign animals' wharf at Yorkhill, where there was only a narrow passage between the slaughter-house and the wharf, and no appliances for unloading deals on the quay. The timber was discharged by the bow port into the river.
