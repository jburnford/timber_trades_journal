SALE of Growing TIMBER on the ESTATE of DRUMMOND CASTLE.
THERE will be Exposed to SALE by PUBLIC ROUP, in the George Hotel, Perth, on FRIDAY, the 22nd day of January, 1892, at One o'clock afternoon, 5,373 TREES, mostly full grown, forming the whole of Auchinglen Wood and Ochtermnthill Strip, and the reserves in Balloch Copse Wood, consisting of 308 Larch, 1,865 Scots Fir, 732 Spruce, 2,025 Oak, 100 Ash, 52 Beech, 149 Birch, 76 Plane, 26 Elm, and 19 Spanish Chestnut, Gean, and Poplar, divided into five lots.

Mr. WILLIAM HUNTER, Forester, Drummond Castle, will point out the several lots previous to the Sale; and the Conditions of Sale may be seen in the hands of HENRY CCRR, Pitkellony House, Muthill.
Pitkellony House, Muthill, 24th December, 1891.

We notice the cargo of large Riga red-wood logs recently referred to has been discharged at Leith, the importers being A. Garland & Roger.
The timber is of heavy dimensions up to 20 in., and is of excellent quality, clean and free from sap.
It seems to be finding a ready market judging from the deliveries taking place direct.
The same firms are also discharging a parcel of very good Riga wainscot logs, of which commodity there is at present only a very limited stock.

There is very little to report concerning the home wood trade, the business is well maintained and orders for consumption are plentiful enough.
An important public sale of standing timber takes place in Perth on Friday next, when over 5,000 trees of all varieties growing on the Drummond Castle estate, will be offered.
Included in t is are some very fine trees and the sale will receive large attention, we refer our readers to advertising column for the details.

TRADE REPORTS.
DUNDEE.
The severe weather which is being experienced at present is curtailing business to a considerable extent, and the mills here are decidedly slack as far as immediate demand is concerned, although orders are on band for forward delivery and prospects are fairly good locally.
We need scarcely remark on the total absence of imports since our last, and we observe a large raft composed of various Baltic and American timbers made up for towage to Aberdeen, the value, judging roughly being, we should say, not far short of one thousand pounds.
Taking these facts into account, stocks may be said to be diminishing at a rapid rate for this season of the year, and a strong position will doubtless be taken up by importers when weather opens and spring business fairly begins.

GLASGOW.
With the close of the new year holidays trade here has resumed its ordinary course, the shipbuilding yards, &c., having been all re-opened from the beginning of this week for the resumption of work.
There are scarcely any imports to note this week, no full cargo; and any parcels of wood goods that have arrived per steam liners have been very light.
For some time lately the parcels arriving, per steamers, from the States were pretty large, comprising a good many walnut and whitewood logs, but for the present there is a lull.
As regards walnut, the stock on hand of small and inferior wood is heavier than desirable, but for good parcels of medium and large squares, the supply of which has been scarce, there is no lack of demand, and very fair prices are obtainable.
Some parcels of this discription have been recently sold ex quay, and one lot of K brand was delivered this week ex store.
With reference to the trade generally, the prospects of a good demand have recently

been adverted to, and, as the year progresses, there is likely, so far as can be seen, to be a development of conditions or circumstances more and more favourable for the timber trade.
Meantime there is nothing of special interest that calls for comment.
The saw-mills are well employed, but, of course, little done in putting stuff out.
From Yorkhill, however, deliveries were going on to a considerable extent for cartage of deals, &c., into the mills; but for some days past, on account of a severe wintry mixture of weather that we have been experiencing, the roads have been in a very slippery state, and there has been less cartage traffic about Yorkhill yards than usual.

GREENOCK.
In the shipyards a general resumption of work took place on Monday last, but house-building operations are at a standstill, on account of the prevailing frosty weather.
Deliveries from the ponds have, to some extent, been retarded by frost and snow, concealing the identity of the logs.
One or two intervals of fresh weather have, however, greatly lessened this difficulty, and work is now progressing pretty much as usual.
The shipbuilding yards here are well employed and the general prospects of a liberal demand for wood goods of all kinds are fairly good; indeed, a satisfactory demand is pretty well assured for the first half of the current year at least.
Prices are firm, with every prospect of higher values immediately, chiefly in consequence of the low state of stocks.
There have been no arrivals since we last reported.
We understand that several ships have already been fixed from Quebec to Greenock at 19s., a rate slightly over that obtained about the same time last year.

LEITH.
The arrivals this week are of a somewhat miscellaneous character, consisting of 229 logs timber, per Dunedin (s), from Riga; 1,200 staves, per Glendower (s), from New York; 3 fathoms lathwood and 432 rickers, per Livonia (s), from Riga; 20 logs oak, per Orient (s), from Stettin; 499 pieces oak and 4,799 oak staves, per Terfing (s), from Libau; and 1,800 oak staves, per Kingsdale (s), from New York.
The holidays being now over, the usual low of business has been resumed, subject only to the interruption occasioned by the wintry weather, which has generally to be reckoned with at this season.
Orders are coming in as well as can be expected, and prospects for the year are fairly good.
A number of the shippers' agents have in Scotland this week, and it is evident, from the f.o.b. prices being paid, that the cost of the new season's goods will be a good deal higher than last.
On the whole, buying is being gone about very cautiously by importers here, until values on the spot can be levelled up.

mentioned by Linnæus.
A fine specimen of it, once to be seen growing at Syon, near London, was 60 ft. high.
There are many varieties of the cultivated filbert trees throughout Great Britain, such as C. alba, or the white filbert; C. rubra, the red filbert; C. ovata, or the oval filbert; C. grandis, the large cob-nut; C. glomerata, which produces its fruit in large clusters at the ends of the branches.
There is also the C. Barceloniensis, or Barcelona filbert.
The best filbert or nut soil is generally found upon a strong loam.
The filbert standards are cultivated 10 or 12 ft. apart, and they admit of green crops intervening, and the working of the latter with the spade and the hoe is of great benefit to the trees.
The filbert trees are kept pruned to a single stem of about 6 ft., with a diameter of the same extent.
With good cultivation the nuts of some of the choice kinds will sometimes fetch as much as £50 per acre.
The squirrel and the nut-hatch are the chief depredators to be guarded against where nuts are grown.
Both these are very destructive to the crop, and their instinct will direct them to well-filled nuts, so that they but seldom either of them waste their energies upon an empty shell.

SOCIAL.—At St. Andrews, on Thursday, the workmen in the employment of Mr. T. Harriss, Kinness Park Saw-mills, to the number of about 40 were entertained to supper in the St. Regulus Hotel, Mr. Harriss in the chair.
A programme of toasts and song was gone through, and a most enjoyable evening was spent, the company separating at an early hour.
