  "text": "JANUARY 16, 1892.\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\n\nThese debentures contained a charge on all the undertakings, including the uncalled capital for the time being.\nMr. Tucker obtained judgment against the company for £4,904, including costs, and on 6th March, 1890, he obtained garnishee orders nisi against six of the contributories, attaching their uncalled capital for his debt.\nNo order absolute was obtained except in one case, and that seemed to have been by a slip.\nThe liquidator's view was that garnishee gained no security by a garnishee order which over-rode a prior encumbrance.\nMr. Hastings, Q.C., for Mr. Tucker, was now understood to admit this, but complained that until the summons was amended, and the bank made a party, no suggestion about the debentures had been given to his client.\nMr. Beale, Q.C., for the Bank of Montreal, said that all his client's costs had been occasioned by Mr. Tucker resisting their application to be made parties.\nHis Lordship said that the right of the bank was now uncontested, and Mr. Hastings' client should not have put the bank to the cost of coming to Court.\nBut between Mr. Hastings and Mr. Buckley, Mr. Hastings was in the right.\nThe order would be that Mr. Tucker should pay the costs of bringing the bank into Court; that Mr. Tucker should have his costs, as against the official liquidator, out of the estate down to the time when the amendment was made; making the bank parties; and that the subsequent costs be allowed to the liquidator against Tucker.\nThe order for the call of £6 per share, to be paid to the account of the Bank of Montreal would also be made.\n\nIMPORTS.\nBRISTOL\nJan. 12 Llandaff City (s)-New York-1 box veneers-Shapland & Petter\n\nCARDIFF.\nJan. 4 Fortescue-Bordeaux-1,100 lds. pitwood-Simkin Bros.\nEmilin-Rochefort-732 lds. pitwood-Watts\n6 Taff-Bordeaux 600 lds. pitwood-Hooper\nLa Rochelle (s)-Bayonne-1,300 lds. pitwood-A.
