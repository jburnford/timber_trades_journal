"LINSODINE."—All users of paints will appreciate the special features of this preparation, which is intended to supersede linseed oil. The chief advantages claimed for "Linsodine" over the ordinary boiled oil are that it is paler in colour, has a stronger and more uniform drying power, dries hard and bright, with a better surface, can be used with confidence for all classes of work, more durable, and does not blister, shrink, or crack. It is cheaper than boiled oil, saving from 25 to 30 per cent. In point of body and consistency it is claimed that "Linsodine" is equal to linseed oil, and that it contains nothing injurious to the qualities of paints. It is supplied in any size of casks, and in tins containing five gallons and ten gallons. The makers are Messrs. Ferguson, Hamilton, & Morison, Kinning Park, Glasgow, whose London representatives are Messrs. Somerville Bros., 1, Bury Street, St. Mary Axe.
