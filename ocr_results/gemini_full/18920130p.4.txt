OBITUARY.—Mr. James Mather died this week in the 91st year of his age. Mr. Mather was born at the croft of Knowehead of Carmyllie, where his father carried on the trade of a joiner. After serving his apprenticeship with his father, Mr. Mather started business on his own account at Cottown of Usan, near Montrose, where he remained for a number of years. He then went into Montrose, and for a very long period he carried on an extensive business as house-carpenter and joiner, having as a partner his eldest son, Mr. John Mather. A considerable time ago the firm was dissolved, Mr. John Mather having left for Canada; and latterly, owing to advancing years, Mr. Mather retired from business.
