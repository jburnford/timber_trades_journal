of the timber trade, and maintained throughout the summer, but heavy impor­tations and a decline in freights had a depressing effect upon the market, causing a general fall in values. The work com­pleted during the year by our Clyde shipbuilders has been on the whole fairly satisfactory, although during the autumn months new orders came in but slowly, in consequence of which large numbers of workmen were thrown out of the yards. As the year closed, however, some important orders were placed. On the whole, the output of tonnage is high on the list of tonnage in the previous history of the trade. The total tonnage built this year in steam and sailing vessels is 338,000 tons, an increase of 10,000 tons compared with 1891. The estimated value of the steam and sailing ships launched this year is £7,500,000, compared with £8,900,000 in 1891, and £8,500,000 in 1890.

A very interesting work has just been published by Mr. George Good, bookseller, Edinburgh, entitled, “Liberton in Ancient and Modern Times.”
It shows a rich fund of historical and antiquarian lore, and on, indicating the studious care the author has acquired of his subject.
There are many interesting illustrations of places and objects in the parish are dis­persed through the book.
ALLOA BUILDER.—Mr. A. Younger, Alloa, has been enter­tained by his fellow-townsmen at a banquet in honour of his jubilee in business.
Mr. Younger, who was in the seventy-fifth year of his age, presided at the ceremony to the honour and memory of Burns. Mr. Mitchell was held by his fellow-citizens both as a man and as a citizen, and Mr. Mitchell was presented with a handsome gold watch and a marble timepiece, as a token of their esteem on the occasion, and his daughter, who kept house for him, was presented with a handsome silver tea and coffee service. Mr. Mitchell, in the course of an interesting reply, made an interesting statement, in the course of which he said :—
“During the fifty years I have executed work in almost all parts of Scotland as well as in England, I may say that no accidents of any consequence ever befel any of my work­men, and I may say that I was fortunate in having several very experienced workmen, some of them having served their apprenticeship in the same shop as I did myself, and I did not often part with my men.
I had a foreman about two years ago who had been with me for forty years, and at the present time there are in the shop two work­men who have been forty and thirty-six years respectively in my employment.”

MESSRS. GABRIEL & Co., of the Dunbar Saw Mills, Dunbar, has sent us a neat and effective office calendar, upon which are depicted sketches of a loading place and timber yard. The calendar is artistic and deserves a permanent place on our walls. The following information is conveyed on the calendar. Two red letter days occur throughout one year. Public sales will be held on March 21st and September 2nd.

SEMI-JUBILEE OF MESSRS MACPHERSON & M’LAREN GRANGEMOUTH.
A social meeting of the employés of Messrs. Macpherson & M’Laren was held on Wednesday evening, to celebrate the semi-jubilee of the firm. There was a large turnout of workmen and wives, friends, and sweethearts. Ex-Provost Macpherson pre­sided.
After supper had been partaken of, Mr. Macpherson said it gave the firm great pleasure to meet them in a social capacity to celebrate the semi-jubilee of the firm of Macpherson & M’Laren. (Applause.) It was now over a quarter of a century since they started business in Grangemouth, and he was glad to be able to say that year after year the business of the firm had been extending and increasing. They had had bad years as well as good years, still he was glad to say that, taking all in all, they had enough and to spare. (Applause.) They all knew that in Mr. M’Laren they had a first-rate chancellor of the exchequer, in pro­viding the ways and means. As employers and employed they met together to raise their Ebenezer, their jubilee stone of remem­brance, saying, “Hitherto the Lord hath helped us.” It was exceedingly interesting to find that there were those who had been with the firm from twenty to twenty-five years—(applause)—and a still larger num­ber who had been ten to twenty years. Not a few who came both to the mill and office as boys had now grown up in the service, and were occupying the highest places in their respective departments--both in the count­ing house and in the mill. (Applause.) He thought they would all agree with him that these facts spoke volumes as to the good relations that existed between employers and employed. The mill was allowed by practical men who had seen it to be one of the best in Scotland, having all the most modern machinery. Orders came in almost every day by telephone and telegraph, and invariably were wanted to be dispatched the same day, if possible, so that they were frequently hard pressed in executing orders. They wanted the men to help them in that

matter. That was one of the reasons why they had to work overtime, not that the firm wanted to work overtime, not at all, but in order to supply the wants of their customers they had to do so. He was going to tell them a secret. Macpherson and M’Laren had got orders that would have gone else­where but for their quickness and dispatch, which went to bring grist to “your mill and oor mill.” (Applause.) He saw before him a large number of young men who, he trusted, in the providence of God, would be spared to meet and celebrate the jubilee of the Forth Saw-mills. He could only express the hope that the jubilee might be as pleasant and harmonious between employers and employés as the semi-jubilee was that night. (Great applause.)
Mr. Fairley said that he had been twenty-two years in connection with the firm, and during that time he was very happy to say that their relations had been of the most pleasant and cordial character. He hoped that the relations for the future would con­tinue as pleasant and as happy as they had been in the past.
Mr. M’Laren said he desired to mingle his congratulations on the happy and auspicious occassion on which they were that evening gathered together. He also congratulated them, as their workmen, on the unanimity and cordiality and good feeling that had existed between employers and employed all these years. (Applause.) If his memory served him right, he thought there was only a little friction—that was a good many years ago—with the workmen, and that was happily got over. They got on fairly and well with their workmen. At the close he had some­thing to say to them, and he would make an application, like the minister at the end of his discourse. He advised them all to start and keep a bankbook. Possibly they had them already, with a good balance. The firm was going to give them something that night, and they should try the savings-bank, even although it should be a small sum. Mr. Macpherson suggested that as a tangible token of their good-will and their satisfaction with them as workmen, they should that night hand them a gift of one week’s wages. (Great applause.) If they carried out his advice and visited a savings bank to-morrow, then
