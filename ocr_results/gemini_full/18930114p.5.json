Little & Ballantyne have extensive nurseries covering over 250 acres, and they are able to recommend first-class men as gardeners, foresters, and bailiffs.

It is matter of legitimate curiosity whether a thick undersowing or underplanting with beech or some shade-enduring wood, might not revive some of the drooping oaks, ashes, and larches, and give them vigour to make a better resistance to the baneful effects of the smoke. The hopes of maintaining green woods in South Yorkshire in the future seem to be directed chiefly towards the sycamore and Spanish chestnut. The sycamore, too, when it springs up to some height, would require to be underplanted with soil-sheltering wood. For, although isolated sycamores are provided with good dense heads of large leaves, yet, growing together, they do not at an advanced stage sufficiently shade the ground.\nAssuming the absence of any such precautionary underplanting, some objections or dangers may be mentioned as peculiarly attaching to open coverts with artificial pruning. The principal danger is that already referred to—the exposure of the soil, endangering its continued fertility, and entailing the loss of all those advantages enumerated at the beginning of this paper. Although it is true that, other advantages of site being equal, each tree in an open covert may make wood rather faster than each tree in a close covert, yet too much of this wood is put on in the branches, whence the necessity for artificial pruning. The shafts of trees in an open covert, unless they can be corrected by pruning, taper very much ; whereas in close order, the crowns and all the leaf power being set high in the canopy, the shafts are proportionally thicker in their upper parts, and do not diminish so rapidly in their girth. In open coverts, too, the shafts occasionally take a crooked form, since malformations due to frosts or other accidents in early youth are not corrected by the nursing\nBELL & SIME,\nTIMBER MERCHANTS AND SAW-MILLERS,\nDUNDEE SAW-MILLS, DUNDEE.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned AMERICAN and BALTIC TIMBER of every description.

It is doubtful whether artificial pruning can entirely eradicate crookedness of shaft. Open coverts also show a good many cases of forking of the shaft. Of course remove the forking, and the resulting crookedness of the shaft is corrected. Again, if each tree in an open covert is liable to require pruning, it is not unlikely that, where there are many and extensive open coverts, there will be many more trees in need of treatment than can possibly be attended to with out detriment to other necessary forest operations. The difficulty is not lessened by the consideration that each tree pruned will probably require periodical pruning several times repeated during its life. This difficulty of labour, with the allied question of expense, seems almost prohibitive of the employment of artificial pruning on a very extensive scale. In a large forest, or the woody parts of a great estate, great stress was laid on the results were encouraging. Pruning may perhaps be more feasible in the woods of a wealthy proprietor, where labour may be available to devote to this purpose ; such woods will be favoured in various ways which could not be adopted in forests depending entirely on their own resources. A forest, if it is to have an independent existence, and pay all expenses out of its own yield, must be large, and economically worked. Even if pruning can be beneficially employed in the woods on a residential estate, it does not follow that artificial pruning can be considered as more than a remedial and rather exceptional operation in forestry. The usefulness of pruning for standards among coppice is scarcely to be denied that it might often be a valuable remedial measure even in high wood forest, if it could be afforded. However desirable and useful it might be even in close coverts, yet in operations on a large scale it has often to be omitted as a too expensive luxury.\nThe question of expense will probably have the greatest force in determining whether the forester shall extensively apply artificial pruning, or whether it will be a deterrent or limiting effect of expense on the extensive application of artificial pruning,\nJAMES JOHNSTON,\nTimber Merchant & Saw-miller,\nTHE SHORE,\nSTIRLING.\nROBERT HOWIE & SONS,\nDUNLOP,\nTimber Merchants, Joiners, & Cartwrights,\nMakers of Washing Machines, Scythe Sneds, Hand Rakes, and Agricultural Woodwork of all descriptions.
