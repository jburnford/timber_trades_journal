Abbott), builders, Chatham.—These bankrupts again appeared for their public examination at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Hayward, on Monday. Frederick Abbott again appeared, and was examined by the Official Receiver (Mr. Prall), and said that the statement of receipts and payments, which he had handed in, was the best he could prepare. He said that in October, 1891, Abbott Bros. had the same amount as they did at the time of the receiving order. The stock at that time was estimated as worth about £700 or some such sum, irrespective of the liabilities. He had no schedule of affairs to which he could refer the Official Receiver. From the 12th October, 1891, to 1st August, 1892, Frederick Abbott paid into the firm £220 18s., which exceeded the sum drawn out by £88 5s. 8d. This money he paid from his own private resources, and not from money received by him on behalf of the firm. Alfred Abbott was then briefly examined, his evidence being in support of the evidence of his brother, previously examined, and the public examination of both bankrupts was then concluded, debtors being allowed to pass.\n\nBAIL'E BRO'S (Robert Samuel Bailie and Francis Edward Bailie), builders and contractors, Lisburn Avenue, Belfast.—The following are among the creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBoyd & Challen, Belfast ... ... ... 113 0 0\nBest & V., Belfast ... ... ... ... 80 0 0\nCampbell J. A., Belfast ... ... ... 25 0 0\nDunlop Bros., Belfast ... ... ... 50 0 0\nDunlop James, Belfast ... ... ... 25 0 0\n\nBOGER, CHARLES J., of Shipbourne, builder.—The first meeting of creditors in this matter was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Maidstone, on Wednesday. The statement of affairs showed liabilities £220 17s. 11d., and assets £10 1s. 3d. The failure is attributed to bad trade and want of capital. The case was left in the hands of the Official Receiver to be wound up in bankruptcy.\n\nCAPSELL, W. J., builder, Holly Cottage, Holly Park, New Southgate.—The public examination of this bankrupt was held on Tuesday at the Barnet Bankruptcy Court. The statement of affairs showed liabilities £1,061 10s. 10d., and assets £202 10s. The bankrupt attributed his failure to losses on building contracts, bad debts, and law costs. The examination was adjourned.\n\nCHAMBERS, SAMUEL, coachbuilder, George Street, Brighton.—The summary of the debtor's statement of affairs shows gross liabilities amounting to £185 19s. 10d., and net assets £39 11s. 10d. Deficiency, £142 10s. The cause of failure ascribed by debtor is \"bad trade.\" The Official Receiver's observations were: The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition on the 22nd December, 1892, and on the same day he was adjudicated bankrupt. The bankrupt states that he commenced business as a coachbuilder in 1873, without capital. That in 1876 he compounded privately with his creditors, paying 5s. in the pound on liabilities amounting to £110. He recommenced business in 1883 in St. James's Street, Brighton, and in March, 1891, when he sold his stock and fittings, he states he had about £200. That in September, 1891, he removed to George Street. Here, rent £61 per annum, but the business there never paid. No proper books of account have been kept. The landlord had distrained prior to the date of the Receiving Officer and has since sold off the whole of the effects.\n\nDERBY, JAMES, builder, of Glenisla, Adelaide Road, Brockley, Kent.—On Tuesday this case again came before the Greenwich Bankruptcy Court, when Mr. Horace Emison, on behalf of Mr. John Barrett, stated that the debtor had served the Official Receiver with a notice of his intention to present a petition for the annulment of the bankruptcy, on the ground that the creditors had been paid in full. It may be remembered that the debtor's estimate of his liabilities showed a surplus of £339 5s. 3d., the total liabilities being £103 10s. The Registrar adjourned the case.\n\nTOIDGE, THOMAS, builder, 36, Ashted Row, Birmingham.—The following are among the creditors in this deed of arrangement:—\n£ s. d.\nCardall & Son, Birmingham ... ... ... 17 0 0\nCity Timber Company, Birmingham ... ... 17 0 0\nChitterbuck & Co., Gloucester ... ... ... 19 0 0\nEckstein & Co., Birmingham ... ... ... 30 0 0\nGriggs & Co., Loughborough ... ... ... 19 0 0\nHales Ed., Birmingham ... ... ... ... 39 0 0\nHassall & Singleton, Birmingham ... ... 33 0 0\nHollis Bros. & Co., Leicester ... ... ... 16 0 0\nKemp & Tabberner, Birmingham ... ... 14 0 0\nNelson & Co., Birmingham ... ... ... 45 0 0\nRudder & Son, Birmingham ... ... ... 13 0 0\nSouthon W., Birmingham ... ... ... 20 0 0\nWood P. & S., West Bromwich ... ... ... [?]\n\nFILMER, EDWARD JETHRO, residing at 48, Castle Road, Luton, formerly of Ashford, thereafter of Chatham, builder.—This bankrupt should have appeared before Mr. Registrar Hayward, at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday last week for his adjourned examination, but failed to do so. The Registrar said that as hitherto the bankrupt had given every assistance he was of opinion that he had mistaken the date of the adjournment, so the examination would be further adjourned till the 16th.\n\nHUGHES, EDWARD, late of Handsworth, now of Solihull, builder and contractor.—The first meeting of creditors in this matter was held on Monday, before the Assistant Official Receiver for Birmingham (Mr. Woollett). The case is a summary one, and the Official Receiver therefore is the trustee in the bankruptcy. The statement of affairs shows debts, £472 9s. 7d.; assets, £457 9s. 2d. The Official Receiver's report states that the debtor up to July, 1891, was engaged as a journeyman carpenter. In that month, without capital, he commenced business at New Road, Solihull, as a builder and contractor. Eight houses, Speedwell Road, Hay Mills, Coventry Road, were finished in September last, and are estimated by the bankrupt at £850. The mortgages are £700 and £75. The property was offered for sale in October last, but there was no bidding. Four villas, Broad Road, Acock's Green, are not complete. The bankrupt ceased working on the day the receiving order was made. He estimates that he has expended £800, whilst the mortgages amount to £740. Four houses, Beechnut Road, Solihull, are also incomplete, and the bankrupt was engaged upon them until the receiving order was made. The bankrupt estimates they have cost him £500, and the mortgages upon them amount to £316. According to the statement of affairs the bankrupt estimates a surplus of £409 from these properties, but the prospect of anything like this amount being realised appears to the Official Receiver remote. The furniture is all claimed by the bankrupt's wife as having been left to her by her father, who died in 1879, and the bankrupt states that he has never been possessed of any furniture. The insolvency is attributed to \"want of capital to finish property.\"\n\nJENNINGS, RICHARD, builder, Horley, Surrey.—This bankrupt came up for his public examination at the last sitting of the Croydon Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Fox. He said that at a private meeting of creditors, some time ago, he submitted an arrangement by which they would be paid in full, and he offered as security the firm of Jennings & Co., Limited, in which he owned nearly 5,000 £1 shares. The creditors declined to accept the offer. He had been in business at Horley since 1880, and he started with a capital of £400. He opened a banking account in 1884. With regard to the company, it was\n\n51\npromoted by a Mr. Walker, who was to act as secretary, and debtor as managing director. The company was registered in 1891, with a capital of £5,000, and one of its objects was to purchase a brickfield from him. He sold 400,000 bricks per annum for £600. The ten acres of land cost him £650, and the machinery £500. The purchase price was fixed at £2,500, payable £1,500 in cash, and £1,000 in fully paid up shares. The prospectus suggested a profit of 10s. per 1,000 on the sale of 2,000,000 per annum. He did not draw up the prospectus, or furnish the statements contained therein. Mr. Walker did not examine his books, as he had not kept any. He did not give Mr. Walker the figures, and he could not say from what source they were obtained. His shares were now held by Head's Bank as security. The examination was finally adjourned until February.\n\nMATTHEWS, GEORGE, builder and contractor, 22, Eastbourne, and Long Acre, Bath.—The Official Receiver for the Bristol District has issued particulars under this failure. The gross liabilities amount to £467 16s., of which £242 7s. 9d. is due to unsecured creditors. The assets, which consist of £150 from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors, are returned at £216 17s. 3d., thus leaving a deficiency of £25 10s. 6d. The debtor alleges his failure to have been caused through losses on building speculations, losses on contracts, illness, and bad debts. The report and observations of the Official Receiver are as follows: The debtor commenced business in 1873 with a capital of £20. His books of accounts have been kept in a very imperfect manner. Although the debtor has expressed an intention of making a substantial offer, no proposal of any sort has been submitted.\n\nPERCIVAL & MORROW (Edward Percival and Thomas Morrow), builders, King Street Mews, Belfast.—The following are the creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nAdams John, Belfast ... ... ... ... 18 17 11\nBrown Anthony O., Belfast ... ... ... 20 6 10\nCarlisle William & Co., Belfast ... ... 20 9 7\nClements John, Belfast ... ... ... 39 7 8\nCorry James P. & Co., Belfast ... ... 200 16 5\nCurrie John & Co., Belfast ... ... ... 47 1 10\nDixon Thomas & Sons, Belfast ... ... 86 8 8\nFisher Thomas, Belfast ... ... ... 12 10 0\nGabbey William, Belfast ... ... ... 27 16 9\nIrvine James, Belfast ... ... ... 13 1 2\nKeys Robert, Belfast ... ... ... 30 0 0\nLowrie David, Belfast ... ... ... 24 0 9\nMartin H. & J. (Lim.), Belfast ... ... 79 4 6\nPotts & Houston, Belfast ... ... ... 46 6 11\n\nPOLLOCK, JAMES, & SONS, builders, High Road, Nottingham, Kent.—At this bankrupt was requested to lodge within twenty-one days a cash account in duplicate, showing his transactions for eighteen months prior to the date of the receiving order. It was stated on Tuesday at the Greenwich Bankruptcy Court, that three days ago debtor, who was present, handed to the trustee some sheets of paper purporting to be the account required in terms of the order, as the object for which it was asked was to trace certain transactions with a Mr. Hutcheon. The Registrar inquired of the debtor how it was that he had not complied with the order of the Court. Debtor said he had done so to the best of his ability. On behalf of the trustee it was said that, on the occasion of his public examination the debtor being examined at considerable length, fenced the questions in such a way as to show that he could comply with the order if he desired to do so. The Registrar informed debtor that if he did not do so he should adjourn the case sine die. He advised him to see the trustee. Eventually the case was adjourned till 31st January. The following are the principal trade creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBonsall & Co., Peckham ... ... ... 188 0 0\nElliott S, Albert Moulding Mills, Newbury 19 0 0\nEldridge & Youngman, Bermondsey ... 17 11 4\nLewis Gasson, Forest Hill ... ... ... 76 0 0\nWatson & Hiscox, Woolwich ... ... 142 0 0\nMessrs. Watson & Hiscox ... ... ... 142 0 0\n\nPRICE, DANIEL, builder, Nantymoel (Glam.).—The public examination of this debtor took place on Friday last, at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court. Replying to questions put by the Official Receiver, debtor said he commenced business in 1883, at Nantymoel, with £50 capital. He had built 120 houses on his own account, besides others for other people. He had sold the houses, with the exception of 32, which had been taken possession of by the mortgagees. He had lost on some of his contracts. The debtor was allowed to pass.\n\nPULLEN, ABEL, builder, Horsham.—The summary of the debtor's statement of affairs shows gross liabilities amounting to £224 12s. 2d., of which is expected to rank £220 7s., and net assets £26 9s. 10d. Deficiency, £203 17s. 2d. The causes of failure are partly secured.",
