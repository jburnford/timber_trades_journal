TREES IN FRENCH CITIES.
Mr. Horace G. Knowles, of the United States Consulate at Bordeaux, writes:—
One of the chief beauties of the French cities, and second only to their magnificent edifices and monuments, are the trees. The almost interminable vistas of chestnuts and acacias stretching along the broad and superbly paved avenues as far as the eye can reach, their bending branches almost touching one another in one endless arch of verdure, form not only a delightful prospect for the eye of resident and visitor alike, but serve to add beauty to cities already beautiful, and grace and symmetry to whatever might be harsh and forbidding.
It must not be presumed, however, that the existence of this veritable rus in urbe is the result of Nature's handiwork alone, for science and art have each in turn lent their aid in converting these great centres into tremendous forest gardens.
In short, the planting as well as the maintenance of the trees in French cities is an item of no little import in the annual budget prepared by the municipal council. Nor does this body look upon their preservation as a matter of less consequence than the repairing of its roadways or the lighting of its streets.
The climate and soil of France are not suited to the nurture and growth of every sort of tree; so that those chosen to line the avenues and boulevards of her cities must be selected with no little judgment.
Chestnuts thrive wondrously. They grow well on a not too rich or generous soil, but require, at the same time, frequent watering at the roots. The elm is also a favourite tree with the professional landscape gardeners, though they are, unfortunately, extremely susceptible to the destructive work of worms and insects. Maples grow slowly, but they are hardy and strong in the end. Add to these the acacia, the linden, the sycamore, the oak and the buttonwood, and the list of trees that live and thrive to advantage in the great continental cities approaches completion.
France imports a great many of her fruit as well as shade trees, and the utmost precaution is taken as to where these shall be planted. Handfuls of earth from each and every spot where a tree is to be placed are carefully examined and analysed. Upon ground rich and moist the trees from the United States grow best. A sandy soil is most favourable to resinous trunks, and so on in proportion to the teachings of science and arboriculture.
In squares and parks, though more especially along the principal thoroughfares, where the trees are planted about twenty feet apart, particular attention is given to the replacing of the dead or dying by healthy trees of the same species. In this way the line of prospective is never broken, nor is the vision repelled by the absence of a single trunk.
It would seem that a great many American cities, with their tremendous expanse of stone, brick, and iron façades, might profit in the provision of shade and verdure by the example set by the cities of France. Side-walk locomotion would be facilitated in the summer months by equal protection from the sun's rays on both sides of the street, while grace, combined with general utility, would serve to make the avenues as attractive, perhaps, as some of them are now for bidding.
Charles Kingsley, if I mistake not, is bidding.

BROKERS' ANNUAL CIRCULARS.
MESSRS. SINGLETON, DUNN, & Co. say:—
A buoyant tone, stimulated by the small stocks held by importers and dealers, the reports of probable light supplies for shipment, and the activity prevailing in all timber-consuming trades, marked the opening of the past year. This buoyancy soon vanished, as holders found it difficult to make sales, and that prices actually receded from the points touched towards the close of 1891. The actual consumption was well maintained in the earlier months of the year; but the amount tendered for shipment was greater than had been reckoned on, and prompted the forcing of spot stocks before new goods came forward. Then the collapse in freights all over caused very low c.i.f. quotations, and this again lowered all values, and produced that feeling of depression and uncertainty which caused buyers generally during nearly the last half of the year to negotiate merely for immediate wants. The import of all goods proved excessive, and in consequence increased quantities compared with a year ago are carried over. Prospects: In respect of prices, the feeling prevails that the lowest has been touched, and, in respect of consumption, there should be an average. Shipbuilders have a good amount of work in hand and in view. The housebuilding trade is active, and promises to continue so during the year. New railways, docks, and other public works are still in progress and more in preparation, and the general trade of the country is in a normal state. Pitch pine timber and Canadian deals during the past year largely took the place of North of Europe red and whitewood logs and deals. The cheapness and excellence of sawn pitch pine has enabled it to supersede the Baltic logs, and this not only in Clyde, but very largely too in the other ports of Scotland.

Baltic deals, 9 in. and up. x 3, were higher than Canadian deals, and dealers bought the latter c.i.f. much more extensively than in former years. It seems probable this will be repeated, as Baltic 9 x 3 white deals are quoted about similar to the last year's rates. Freights fluctuated during the year, beginning at 18s. 6d. to 19s. for timber, Quebec to Greenock, closing at 16s., and for deals per steamers chiefly at 40s. to 45s.; Montreal and Quebec to Glasgow closing at 50s. From Lower Ports rates varied from 35s. to 45s. From pitch pine ports rates were 100s. at the beginning of the year, running down to 87s. 6d. at the close. For fresh pitch pine business from 85s. to 90s. may be quoted as current to direct ports.
