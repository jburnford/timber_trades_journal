FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists, hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BOOTH, HENRY, of Mawney's Road, Romford, in the County of Essex, builder.—The Official Receiver has issued his summary in this case, under date 13th inst. The report and observations state that the receiving order was made on the 15th of December, 1892, on the petition of the debtor himself, and by an order bearing the same date the debtor was adjudged bankrupt. The bankrupt commenced to trade on his own account at Romford as a builder about March, 1886. He had no capital of his own, but borrowed about £80 (since repaid). The bankrupt states that for the last four years he has been working on contract. He attributes his position to illness for the last four years of his wife and daughter, to losses on contracts (estimated at £200) within the last four years and to a loss of £50 (bad debts) incurred four years ago. The bankrupt asserts that he is unable to state when he became aware of his insolvency, but he admits he was insolvent three years ago. The statement of affairs shows that almost all the present debts, amounting to £1,052 1s. 4d., have been contracted by the bankrupt since he became aware that he had not sufficient property to pay all his debts in full. The bankrupt appears to have had no reasonable expectation of meeting his liabilities, and states that he has been paying money away as far as he was able to within the last three months, and that he did not expect the house put up for sale on the 14th ult. would yield a greater surplus than £150. There are no cash creditors. The outstanding claims are shown to be due to ordinary trade creditors. The amount of the gross liabilities is set down at £1,312 13s. 4d., of which £1,052 1s. 4d. is expected to rank, and the estate shows a deficiency of £693 5s. 5d.
BOWES, SAM., builder, 34, Besley Street, Streatham.—The summary of the debtor's statement of affairs shows gross liabilities amounting to £16,216 6s. 3d., of which is expected to rank £1,271 6s. 3d., and net assets £519 12s., deficiency £751 14s. 3d. The receiving order herein was made on the 17th November, 1892, on the petition of creditors, the act of bankruptcy being the failure of the debtor to comply with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice served on him on August 11th, 1892. The petition was presented on October 18th. The bankrupt states that he was by trade a carpenter, but that in 1879 he began to build houses on speculation. His capital was £250 cash and £100 plant, besides some building on which he had paid £50 deposit. The bankrupt attributes his present insolvency to the dishonouring of a cheque given by Mr. Barrs the solicitor to the petitioning creditor in consideration of which I had given Mr. Barrs a second charge on my property in Worfield Street, Albert Road, Battersea." The sitting for the public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Wandsworth Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week. The receiving order was made on the petition of a creditor, and the Assistant Official Receiver (Mr. J. G. Gibson) said he must ask for an adjournment, as the debtor had not filed his statement of affairs. Mr. Preston, for the petitioning creditor, supported, and the Registrar adjourned the examination until February 9th. The creditors are:—

BUCKERIDGE, L. M.—In our report of this case last week Messrs. Houghton Bros., Devonshire Chambers, Bishopsgate Street Without, E.C., were stated to be unsecured creditors for £1,625. We now learn that they are not creditors of this company at all, except inasmuch as they hold, as a collateral security, some of the first debenture bonds. If (we are informed) the error arose from the fact that Mr. Walter Buckeridge was at the date of the formation of the company somewhat heavily in Messrs. Houghton's debt, the figures
