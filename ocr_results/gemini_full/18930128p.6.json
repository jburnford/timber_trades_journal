B. M'Donald, the city engineer.\nOutwardly, the Italian style of architecture has been adopted, and the white freestone of Giffnock quarries will be used in the construction of the walls.\nThe elevation will be three storeys in height, and to Oxford Street two storeys; but as the court-room, with a lofty roof, is to be situated on the upper storey in the latter street, the height of the building will be nearly the same all over.\nThere will be 55 cells, giving accommodation for 160 prisoners, and also the usual rooms for the police officials of the district.\nA part of the building will be utilised as barracks for 30 men, consisting of kitchen, mess-room, baths, and reading and recreation room, and a separate bedroom for each man.\nIn rear of the buildings there will be a large open quadrangle for drilling the men, with a commodious muster hall on one side of it.\n\nS.
