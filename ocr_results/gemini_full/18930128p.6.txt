GLASGOW.—Operations are about to commence for the erection of a new police station for the southern district of Glasgow.
A site has been secured at the corner of Nicholson Street and Oxford Street, and designs for the building have been prepared by Mr. A. B. M'Donald, the city engineer.
Outwardly, the Italian style of architecture has been adopted, and the white freestone of Giffnock quarries will be used in the construction of the walls.
The elevation will be three storeys in height, and to Oxford Street two storeys; but as the court-room, with a lofty roof, is to be situated on the upper storey in the latter street, the height of the building will be nearly the same all over.
There will be 55 cells, giving accommodation for 160 prisoners, and also the usual rooms for the police officials of the district.
A part of the building will be utilised as barracks for 30 men, consisting of kitchen, mess-room, baths, and reading and recreation room, and a separate bedroom for each man.
In rear of the buildings there will be a large open quadrangle for drilling the men, with a commodious muster hall on one side of it.

A YEAR'S FIRES IN GREENOCK.—Mr. William Taylor, Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, has reported to the Police Board that the total number of alarms received during the year was 61.
Of these 58 were for fires, and three proved to be alarms only.
Of the 58 fires, 36 were attended by the brigade with engines, &c.
The fires for the year ending December 31st show an increase of six compared with those of 1891.

AN IMMENSE FIR POLE.—An immense fir pole has lately been erected in front of the Washington State building in the Chicago Exhibition.
It came from a forest near Everet, where it towered to a height of 300 ft.
When the top was cut off there was a trunk of 238 ft. left.
Owing to its great length the tree had to be cut in two, so as to enable it to pass over the lines of railway, the curves being unsuited to its being carried whole.
Even when cut in two four cars were required for each piece.
When it reached Jackson Park it was spliced with a steel band, and after considerable labour and expense it was got on end with a globe on the top, and it now forms a most conspicuous object in the grounds.

INGENIOUS DOVETAILING.—A case containing nine dovetail puzzles of an ingenious nature—the work of over 22 years—has just been presented to Paisley Museum by Mr. James Anderson, Paisley.
They are as follows:—1. Challenge trying square made out of two pieces of wood only, showing no less than nine distinct dovetails.
2. Two pieces of wood joined by the triple reverse-lock dovetail.
3. Two pieces of wood joined by four dovetails.
4. Two pieces of wood joined by twelve dovetails of four sizes.
5. Two pieces of wood joined by five dovetails and no joint anywhere.
6. Two pieces of wood joined by three dovetails.
7. Five pieces of wood, four inserted through the plate, with a stopper on both end and no joint anywhere.
8. Four pieces of wood, three intersected through the plate, metred on both ends, and no joint anywhere.
9. Two pieces of wood, one inserted through the plate, with a double stopper on both ends and no joint anywhere.

DICK'S PATENT BELTING
(GUTTA PERCHA AND CANVAS).
Have been thoroughly tested, and have proved them to be absolutely the best Driving Belts for the various qualities of work they are adapted for.
THEY ARE OF
GREAT STRENGTH,
UNEQUALLED DURABILITY,
PERFECT SMOOTHNESS AND GRIP,
Which makes fraying at the edges impossible, and ensures a complete contact with the pulley.

R. & J. DICK,
GREENHEAD, GLASGOW.
Messrs. R. & J. DICK.
Dash Bros.—In reply to your letter of yesterday's date, which regarding your Belting, we have pleasure in stating that we find your belting for a main drive, and for our planing machines, especially suitable where so much shifting is required.
We have had one of your new jointe' where a new belt was put on, and we find them to wear well and give every satisfaction.
We have no hesitation in recommending your belting to any one in the trade, as we find it superior to any other we have tried, and the mode of fastening is very simple and lasting.—Yours faithfully,
(Signed) [?] & Co.
