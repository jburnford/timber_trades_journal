CASUALTIES TO TIMBER-LADEN VESSELS.

FALMOUTH, January 28.—Norwegian schooner Hoffnung, from Doboy, timber, arrived here to-day leaky and lost bulwarks.
DOVER, January 28.—German schooner Gripen, from Bordeaux for Rotterdam, arrived here for orders, reports loss of bulwarks, sails, stanchions started, top sides leaky; vessel much strained.
BORDEAUX, January 31.—Swedish barque Vita, from Pensacola, laden with wood, has arrived leaky. It is reported that the cargo is not yet damaged, but the extent of the damage has not been ascertained.
GENOA, January 27.—Telegrams from Constantinople state that a violent gale had been blowing in the Black Sea for some days. Greek brig Prodromos, from Galatz with wood, has been wrecked near Midia. Greek vessel, Manolaki, from Galatz, wood, has been lost at the mouth of the Bosphorus.
PENSACOLA, January 31.—Barque Star of India, for London, was passed January 22nd, lat. 41.12 N. long. 28.30 W., abandoned and waterlogged, foremast gone; lower main and mizenmasts, mainyard, bowsprit, and jib-boom standing; the main deck was level with the water. She was quite in the track of ships between Fayal and Flores Island.
CHRISTIANIA, January 26.—Brig Mira, of Arendal, from London for Christiania, is ashore near Svinoer. She is a total loss.
DROBAK, January 23.—Steamer Primus, of Drobak, from London for Drobak, was grounded at Elleskjoer, but was got off after discharging part of cargo, and safely moored at Elleskjoer. Later advices state she has been examined by a diver, and found to be uninjured.
VICTORIA, B.C., January 20.—British ship George Thompson, from New Westminster for Sydney, N.S.W., lumber, before reported aground in the river at Vancouver, has been towed over the bar in the Fraser River, and is now in Burrard Inlet. She had to be lightened of 250,000 ft. of lumber before going down the river. She will not go to Esquimault, but on arrival at Sydney will go into dock for repairs. An examination of her hull has been made, and it was found that a few of her copper plates had been torn off. She has been strained, and is leaking a little, but not sufficient to prevent her proceeding on her voyage. She will probably sail to-morrow (January 11th).
QUEENSTOWN, January 31.—Barque Velox, of Fredrikstadt, Apalachicola for Conway, which was abandoned December 6th, as previously reported, was towed into Queenstown to-day derelict.
