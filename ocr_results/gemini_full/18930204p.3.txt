LEITH.
There have been no arrivals of wood goods during the past seven days. With open weather, trade moves, if not with any great briskness, at least steadily, and as deliveries are being made from yarded stocks, a sensible impression is beginning to be made on same. On the same day this week was taken up by Messrs. A. Garland and Roger, who offered a fairly large variety of American and other hardwood goods. Although the company was rather thin at first, as the sale proceeded there was a fairly large attendance of buyers. The auctioneer (Mr. J. W. Hardie) devoted most of his attention to the log timber, and succeeded in clearing a line of waney boardwood at from 2s. 4d. to 2s. 6d. per cubic foot; a small parcel of canary whitewood, of superior quality, at 2s. 4½d. to 2s. 6d. Several other lots were placed at the following prices:—Birch at 5s. 6d., Riga wainscot at 4s. 4d., American walnut at 4s. 6d., all per cubic foot; Mexican mahogany at 7d., and Merant at 4d. per super. foot. It was late in the day before the Baltic goods were reached, and consequently the quantity of deals and battens placed was not so large as usual, but a number of lots of the various dimensions found buyers. Prices were practically unchanged from those of the previous week's auction.

A large cabinet-making establishment belonging to Mr. Intosh, at Kirkcaldy, is fitted with automatic Sprinklers.
LEITH.—It is recommended that a new school be erected to accommodate 500 pupils. It is estimated that the cost of such a school would be from £7,000 to £8,000.
DALKEITH.—There were great rejoicings in the town, on Monday, on the occasion of the coming of age of the Earl of Dalkeith, heir to the Dukedom of Buccleuch, proprietor of Granton Harbour. The event was celebrated in the evening by a banquet held in the town, at which the officials of the harbour and a large party of the surrounding neighbourhood were present. The chair was occupied by Mr. Alexander Thomson, of Mitchell Thomson & Co., who proposed the toast of the evening.
