LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT.
HERRMANN v. WESTMAN.
This case came on in the Secondary's Court, Guildhall, on Wednesday, before Mr. Secondary Roderick and a jury. It was an action by Messrs. Herrmann & Co., timber merchants, of Eastcheap Buildings, against Mr. John Westman, a timber merchant, carrying on business in Sweden, to recover damages for breach of contract. The defendant had allowed judgment to go by default, and the case had been remitted from the High Court for assessment of damages. The plaintiffs estimated their total loss at £216 9s. 10d.
Mr. Jas. Gray, counsel for the plaintiff, said by the first contract, which was dated February 4th, 1892, the defendant sold to the plaintiff 850 fathoms of timber. The defendant knew at the time that the plaintiff was buying the timber for the purpose of re-sale. On the 850 fathoms, the plaintiff actually sold to a firm named Allen 130 fathoms. But the defendant sent wood which was absolutely worthless, and which did not come within the description of the contract.
A term of the second contract was that the plaintiff should charter a vessel and send it to Sweden for shipment of the timber to London. This the plaintiff did, but when the vessel arrived the timber was not ready and the vessel had to come away without it. The plaintiff had entered into an agreement to re-sell this timber to Messrs. Crundall & Co., and, in consequence of being unable to carry out this contract, he had sustained loss.
Mr. Maximilian Julius Herrmann was called, and bore out the opening statement of counsel, stating that he had entered into the contracts with the defendant through his (defendant's) agent in London, Mr. Knudsen, who knew that he intended to re-sell the timber.
The Secondary briefly summed up the evidence, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount claimed, £216 9s. 10d.

DUNDEE BILL OF LADING DISPUTE.
THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND v. DONALD BROTHERS & Co., Mobile, Alabama, v. THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND and others.
On Saturday Lord Low gave judgment in this action, which was to recover payment of £688 10s. 5d. consigned with the Bank at Dundee, and also £300 as damages, and to obtain declarator as to a bill of lading held by the Bank. It was stated that in November last Donald Brothers & Co. chartered the Norwegian barque *Lakme* to convey a cargo of pitch pine from Mobile to this country, and bills of lading were sent on to the pursuers. The *Lakme* sailed on 23rd November, and, as the cargo had been purchased by Mr. John Jessiman, timber merchant, Dundee, it was sent to the Tay, and arrived on Friday, 29th January. On 21st November Samuel Craig Thomson, merchant, Dundee, had sold the cargo of the *Lakme* to Mr. Jessiman at the price of £1,975 8s. 7d., less freight, insurance, &c. One of the bills of lading, endorsed was forwarded by them on receipt of the sale. On 10th December Jessiman accepted the pursuers' bill for £820 17s. 1d, being the price of the cargo under deductions. A bill of Jessiman's for £630 15s. 9d. fell due at the Bank on 20th December, and pursuers said that on 29th December he endorsed the *Lakme* bill to the Bank in security, they believing, of advances made by the Bank to him.

to the amount of £1,369 9s. 2d. On 3rd January Thomson, in order to protect the pursuers, intimated to the defenders, Pettersen and Buik, who are agents for the ship, that he held an endorsed bill of lading for the *Lakme's* cargo, and requested information of the arrival of the vessel. It was accordingly intimated to the master of the *Lakme* on his arrival at the mouth of the Tay, by letter delivered by a pilot cutter, that the purchaser of the cargo had suspended payment, and that the pursuers claimed the cargo. Immediately on the arrival of the vessel the Royal Bank presented a petition in the Sheriff Court at Dundee for interdict against the pursuers' agent taking delivery of the cargo. Interim interdict was granted, and the cargo was discharged and sold under reservation of the rights of parties, and the sum now claimed was consigned in that bank. Pursuers claimed the cargo as onerous holders of the bills of lading, and maintained that the attempt on the part of the Royal Bank to seize the cargo had entailed a loss of £300 on them. They also claimed that the endorsation by Jessiman was reducible, as having been granted within 60 days of bankruptcy. The Bank defended the action on the ground that Jessiman was a customer of the Bank, and that they held as security against overdrafts a bill of lading endorsed by him for a cargo of timber from Quebec. He got that bill from them on 29th December on delivery to them of the bill for the *Lakme's* cargo. On the arrival of that ship in the Tay a representative of the Bank presented to the captain the bill of lading which had been endorsed to them, and the captain admitted it was first presented to him, and said he would obey it. Next day, however, he and the agent for the ship said they did not know what to do in consequence of pursuers' agent claiming the cargo, and the Bank then presented their petition to the Sheriff.
Lord Low, in disposing of the case, said the questions to be determined were (1) whether value was given by the defenders for the *Lakme* bill of lading, and (2) whether the bill was not given in security of the existing overdraft. If no value was given for the bill, then the defenders were not onerous endorsees, and could not compete with the unpaid seller who stopped the goods in transitu. If the bill was given in security of the prior debt the transaction was reducible under the Act of 1696, c. 5. His Lordship was of opinion that, although in one sense the bill was given in security of the prior overdraft, in that it came in place of the *Stralsund* bill, yet the immediate consideration which the defenders gave for the *Lakme* bill was the *Stralsund* bill, which they handed back to Mr. Jessiman. If the *Stralsund* cargo had not been delivered he did not think that it was disputed that the bill applicable to that cargo would have been full value for the *Lakme* bill. But the pursuers argued that, the cargo having been delivered, the *Stralsund* bill was worthless. As between the defenders and Mr. Jessiman, it seemed to his lordship that the *Stralsund's* bill of lading was of value to the former although the cargo had been delivered. If the purchaser of a cargo in course of transit endorsed the bill of lading for value, and then fraudulently procured delivery of the cargo to himself, his Lordship could not think that the bill of lading became worthless. So long as the cargo was in the endorser's possession, he thought that the endorsee would be entitled to claim it, as against him, by virtue of the bill of lading. Then the master of the *Stralsund*, by delivering the cargo without production of the bill of lading, rendered himself and the owners liable to the true owner of the cargo if it turned out that the person to whom it was actually delivered had no right to it. So long as the defenders retained the bill of lading they had a title to claim against the master and owners for loss which they had sustained through the unwarrantable delivery of the cargo; but when they gave up the bill of lading they parted with their title to make such a claim. When, therefore, the defenders re-delivered the bill of lading he thought that they gave up a valuable security in that bill, which they might otherwise have enforced. When they exchanged it for the *Lakme* bill, which they also had in a question with Mr. Jessiman, his Lordship was, therefore, of opinion that they gave value for and were onerous endorsees of the *Lakme* bill. The same considerations seemed to him to negative the idea that the transferance of the *Lakme* bill was struck at by the statute of 1696. The view which he had taken of the bill was sound, the transferance of the bill was not a voluntary conveyance in security of a prior debt, but a transaction in the ordinary course of dealing between the parties in which immediate value was given and received. It had been argued that the defenders could not be held to be *bona-fide* holders of the bill of lading, because at the time they received it they knew Mr. Jessiman was insolvent. There was no doubt that if Jessiman had only had his own resources to rely upon he would have been insolvent; but he was being aided by his father. It appeared to have been a man of means, and at the time the transferance took place an arrangement was almost completed which would have enabled Mr. Jessiman to meet his outstanding obligations and continue business. In such circumstances his Lordship did not think it could be said that the defenders could not in good faith and honestly take the bill of lading. He was therefore of opinion that the defenders were entitled to prevail, and assoilzied them with expenses.
