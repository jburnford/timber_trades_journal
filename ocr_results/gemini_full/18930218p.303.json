However well versed they may be in French language, such a book as that compiled by Mr. Williams should prove of considerable utility, since it enables the English trader to see at a glance the value of any French quotation, and vice versa, by giving in parallel columns with the English prices the equivalent values in French currency for the usual quantities recognised by the trade in each country. The little work has internal evidence of the author's thorough acquaintance with both French and English trading operations, and an important feature of the work is that the prices are given at any rate of exchange.\nArchitects' and Builders' Price Book. By W. Young. London: E. & F. N. Spon; New York: Spon & Chamberlain. 1893.\nThis well-known authoritative price book has now reached its twentieth edition and comes to us enlarged in size, with extended memoranda, and with additional information. While improvements have been made on the original plan of the work, we are glad to see that the arrangement of the matter in alphabetical sequence has been adhered to as in the former editions. It is unnecessary to further commend Spon's Builders' Price Book, for its reliability is so generally acknowledged and its comprehensive utility so widely appreciated that most architects and builders requiring such a work will probably possess themselves of a copy without further urging on our part.\n\nVast Saving in Fuel, Wear, and Tear.\nUNQUESTIONABLY THE BEST\nTELLURIC CEMENT\nFOR COVERING BOILERS PIPING &c &c\nSUTCLIFFE BROS.,\n\nIMPORTS.\nBARROW.\nFeb. 9 Urania-Port Blakeley-40 lds. sawn fir-Master\nBRISTOL.\nFeb. 13 Wells City (s)-New York-100 lancewood spars-T.

They were on the Atlantic Ocean, when Johun's foot slipped, and he fell from the mast to the deck. He died shortly afterwards, and was buried at sea. Another accident also befell the mate at Hartlepool. He was hauling in the tow rope when his hand got caught between the rope and the hole. He was taken to the hospital, where it was found his fingers were cut from his left hand. The mate said he had never been in such rough weather before. The Midas is from Pensacola with a cargo of timber for West Hartlepool.\nA NEW SYSTEM OF WOOD PAVING.—Mr. P. J. Jackson, 17, Grainger Street, Newcastle-on-Tyne, has secured patent rights for street paving on an entirely new principle. His system is the ordinary creosoted wood block, cut in grooves, circles, or other shaped sections on the face of the block. The interstices, as well as the edges of the blocks and intervening spaces between the blocks, are, when laid, filled in with a composite material in a liquid state, which afterwards sets as hard as granite. Specimen blocks have been submitted to experts, who consider it will meet the want of a noiseless and lasting pavement; while being part wood and part asphalte gives comfort to horses from the grip or hold secured, and which neither wood, asphalte, nor granite alone gives. It will avoid the danger arising from slipperiness which exists on the asphalted streets of London. Mr. Jackson has obtained permission from the Newcastle Corporation authorities to lay a specimen of his paving, and the thoroughfare selected by the City Engineer is New Bridge Street, so as to try it against the paving now being laid on the north side of that street, and both of which will be laid by Messrs. Armstrong, Addison, & Co., of Sunderland.\n\nGreater Safety, Durability, and Economy.\nSUPERIOR ENAMELLED & PLAIN\nGAUGE GLASSES\n& NEEDLE LUBRICATORS, EXTRA STRONG\nCAUCES APPLICATIONS EXTRA STRONG\nNEAR MANCHESTER.",
