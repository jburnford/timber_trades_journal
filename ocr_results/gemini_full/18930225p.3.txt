re in Ecuador, according to Mr. Haggard's report, is still in its infancy. It is carried on with a wooden plough, and agricultural implements are unknown. Owing to the lack of roads, all haulage is done on the backs of men, donkeys, or Indians. There is no market for surplus produce, and the harvest is declared to be the property of the cultivator, by payment of certain prices. Less than one-hundredth part of the inhabited land of the Republic is under cultivation. In spite of these circumstances, Mr. Haggard is of opinion that it will have a great future before it.

THE FORTH BRIDGE.—Sir John Fowler, one of the engineers of the Forth Bridge, states as a curious fact that while at the present time work several of the men employed on the bridge 150 or 160 feet high, without being killed or even injured, there is not enough left in the caissons for them to catch a rope to save themselves from, but not breath enough to last them the next fortnight, they can go down and lay perfectly still, and at the end of that time they generally recover. It has been beaten up by the same egg arrangement, and the percentage of loss of life has been opened up while it was being built. The same authority that the design of the bridge as a whole, and of its class is unique, has been granted. In fact, it will be nearly half as long as the Forth Bridge. The cost will be £500,000 sterling.

FORESTRY will be a feature of the Exhibition at Earls Court, London, S.W., to be held during the coming summer.

GLASGOW.—The Scotsman says:—'The briskness in the building trade in Glasgow shows no sign of abatement. At one sitting at the Dean of Guild Court eleven 'linings' were granted for the erection or alteration of property in the city. Mrs. Ferguson, Inverleith Row, Edinburgh, received the necessary permission to alter and add to property at 7, Ferguson Street, and Paterson's Chemical Manufacturing Company, Limited, to add to their works at Lochburn.

DUNDEE INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTURE, SCIENCE, AND ART.—The third ordinary meeting of the institute for the session was held in the hall of the Young Men's Christian Association on Thursday evening, when a lecture was delivered on 'The Theories of Architectural Proportion' by Mr. Archibald Macpherson, architect, Edinburgh. The following is a resumé of the lecture:—The three things necessary for students of architecture—any advance lately made by present-day architecture has been in the direction of greater correctness of beauty of detail—the study of general proportion and scale less attended to—some cursory examination of now neglected theories likely to prove interesting—fifty years ago—'the geometric principle of beauty analysed'—its relation to optics—to music — early investigators — pedantic rules applied to Gothic buildings by modern theorists would make their design a geometrical puzzle—the existence of traditional rules recognised in mediæval times, nevertheless indisputable—the evidence of ancient plans — other documentary evidence — the theory of Viollet-le-Duc—definition of proportion—application of the theory in detail to some mediæval French buildings—the use of certain angles probable enough as a handy method of setting out ancient buildings, but anything like a rigid system of proportion to which the designer was subject inadmissible—no series of geometrical ratios, however cunningly reasoned out, will ever take the place of the cultured mind and trained eye of a true artist.

EDINBURGH.—The Public Parks Committee of the Town Council has authorised estimates to be got for new greenhouses in lieu of those displaced by the railway extension in Prince's Street Gardens. It is proposed to erect the new houses in Inverleith Park. The estimates of Messrs. John Morris & Sons, contractors, amounting to £1,077, for the embankment and the planting of trees and shrubs in East and West Prince's Street Gardens have been accepted.
