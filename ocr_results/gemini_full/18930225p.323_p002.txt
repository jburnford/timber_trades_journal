COOK, JAMES, coachbuilder, Harrow Bridge Works, Stratford.—Upon the application of Messrs. Ward, Perks, & McKay a receiving order was made in this case on Tuesday under a creditor's petition. The debtor states that the rent of his works is £60 in arrears, and there was a small stock of timber and materials on the premises not sufficient to cover the rent. There was also timber of the value of about £40 at the Imperial Saw-mills, Bow Bridge. The amount of the debts was not stated.

COSTER, JAMES, builder, Eastbourne. —This bankrupt attended at the local Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Coles, for his order of discharge. Mr. Æ. Mackintosh appeared for the trustee, and Mr. Williams for several creditors. Bankrupt said he believed he was solvent in 1889—he had no difficulty in meeting the bulk of his bills—and also in 1890, but there might have been one or

two renewed; he attributed that, however, to having some large contracts. Towards the end of 1891 he was £1,000 to the bad. He made no definite request to the bank to meet his bills, but they paid them as they fell due if there was sufficient balance. He was now doing piecework. The examination was adjourned until March 16th to enable the bankrupt to furnish a statement showing his financial position in December, 1889, and also in March, 1890.

FOSTER HENRY, ALFRED, AND THOMAS.—The receiving order under this failure was made in April, 1891, and the Official Receiver applied on Friday for the approval of a scheme of arrangement agreed to by the creditors. The debtors were timber merchants in Gt. Eastern Street, and at Singleton, Sussex, and Henry and Alfred Foster were also partners in a somewhat similar business at Boxmoor, Herts. They propose that agreements for the sale of their partnership property to "Fosters, Limited," be carried into effect by the trustees, who will receive £8,500 in cash, and 5,750 in £1 fully paid-up preference shares of the company as consideration. The money will be applied in the first place in payment of costs and preferential debts, and the residue will be divided amongst the joint creditors at the rate of 10s. in the pound. The shares will be allotted to such creditors as may desire to have them at par value to 10s. in the pound, the residue to be sold and the proceeds divided rateably amongst the other creditors. The trustee certified that the scheme would be distinctly to the advantage of the creditors, as, in the event of a forced realisation, nothing approaching the amount at which the assets were estimated by the debtors would be obtained from them. The Official Receiver also reported in favour of the proposed scheme. Mr. Registrar Hope intimated that he would probably confirm the scheme on being satisfied by the Official Receiver that there had been a separate voting by the creditors as provided by rule 267. He granted a formal adjournment for one week.
