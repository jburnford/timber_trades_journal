Russell & Co., Port Glasgow, by Messrs. Allan & Co.\nMessrs.

Edmiston & Mitchells' public sale this week has been postponed, and Messrs. Singleton, Dunn & Roger announce their sale for the 15th inst.\n\nFORFAR.—The Forfar District Committee of the County Council has decided to erect a new bridge ford at Revernie, near Kirriemuir, at about £100.\nThe Forfar Town Council has approved of the plans of a new street in the north end of the town.\nA new fire engine is to be purchased for the town from Messrs.
