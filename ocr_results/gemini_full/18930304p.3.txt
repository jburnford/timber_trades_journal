GLASGOW.

GREENOCK.
The demand is improving, but the prices are not so appreciable as to be scarcely worth quoting.
Deliveries are proceeding favourably by rail, and are chiefly to consumers, merchants and saw-millers, whose stocks, which usually occupy a large space, as water deliveries, are, for the time, very limited in extent, being a sufficient testimony of the healthy condition of that industry.
There were no arrivals during the week, but to-day several sailers are due with pitch pine.
The contracts for the month of February show a considerable falling off in tonnage launched when compared with the corresponding month of last year.
Indeed, only for the Cunard liner, the Lucania, at present building, the total would have been the lowest on record.
The order for this district has been placed with Messrs. Russell & Co., Port Glasgow, by Messrs. Allan & Co.
Messrs. Singleton, Dunn & Co.'s auction sale on Wednesday last, at James Watt Dock, Greenock, owing to the small attendance of the trade, and the general dulness of business resulting was not an attractive one.
The prices of the pine sold were low.

The deliveries of wood goods to consumers used to be seven days, but now it is understood that here will likely be an alteration, as the Norwegian battens are arriving, and in the meantime the consumption of home wood goes on steadily, and has not been interrupted this week by bad weather.
There ought to be an improvement with the advancing season.
Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells' public sale this week has been postponed, and Messrs. Singleton, Dunn & Roger announce their sale for the 15th inst.

FORFAR.—The Forfar District Committee of the County Council has decided to erect a new bridge ford at Revernie, near Kirriemuir, at about £100.
The Forfar Town Council has approved of the plans of a new street in the north end of the town.
A new fire engine is to be purchased for the town from Messrs. Shand, Mason & Co., London.

GREENOCK.—Messrs. Russell & Co., Port Glasgow and Greenock, have secured the contract for a large sailing ship of 2,700 tons measurement for Mr. D. M'Gillivray, Greenock.

IN DUNDEE.—Ex-Provost JAMES Mitchell has purchased the property in Seagate, on, where they have for many years been the representatives of the wire system which has been laid down by Messrs. Whyte & Co., of Glasgow, the price being the sum of £1,000, being the balance of the amount of their contract for the lighting of the town by the electric light.
Mr. Alexander M'Ritchie has received the second instalment of his contract for lighting the station.
