  "text": "LLOWGATE GLASGOW.\nArchitraves, &c.\n\nstances connected with the original plan of the new town, for which the poverty or narrow spirit of the times in which it originated forms no sufficient answer. It unfortunately occurred to some of the parties concerned that the earth dug out of the foundation of the new houses might be employed to advantage in forming a communication with the old town, by the creation of that mound of earth which is now extended cross the valley. For this purpose the proprietors and builders of houses were bound, in their contracts with the city, to excavate their front areas to a certain depth, in order that each might contribute a share of earth to a great and, as it was then thought, most useful undertaking. This was the origin of that huge deformity which extended its lumpish length betwixt Bank Street and Hanover Square, the most hopeless and irremediable error which has been committed in the course of the improvements of Edinburgh, and which, when the view which it corrupted was contrasted with that which it presented, was, and must be, a subject of constant regret and provocation. Had the feuars formed in the new town been no more than half their present depth, the following consequences would have necessarily arisen:—(1) The feuars, relieved of a very considerable expense, would have been able to pay a larger ground-rent. (2) The houses, being higher by the half-storey which is now buried below ground, would have acquired more dignity and importance. (3) The surplus saved would have been more than sufficient to build a handsome arched bridge where the earthen hulk extends itself, furnishing all the convenience now derived from that mass of deformity, and substituting instead an object of high architectural beauty. The new town of Edinburgh, as originally planned, contrary to every prediction which had been uttered on the subject, was built and occupied within forty years after it had been commenced.\n\nEDINBURGH.—The members of the Edinburgh Architectural Association recently visited the M‘Ewan Hall, Edinburgh, where they were received by Dr. Anderson, the architect, who showed the party over the building. He explained that he had adopted the form of the Greek theatre, believing that to be the best form for the auditorium. There were two galleries, both alike, the one above the other, and the building was capable of holding three thousand people. The arrangement of the staircases was such that the occupants of the two galleries never came together, and there were a good many entrances and exits. A large skylight and a series of windows close to the roof furnished the principal means of lighting the building, and the air was to be heated by passing over a steam coil. There was a great outer wall, and an inner wall of arches and pillars, the diameter of the building being 144½ feet. To roof such a building was rather a problem. He had called in the assistance of Mr. Arrol, and of Messrs. Cunningham, Blyth, and Westland. It was to be hoped that before long the great tower would be erected—a tower which would reach to about 280 feet in height. Behind the platform there was a gallery, where, he understood, there was to be erected an organ. Mr. Westland, at the request of the architect, described the construction of the roof. It was carried on twenty-two ribs, which had to be of particularly strong construction, because it was impossible to put in any tie-rods. The horizontal strain had to be borne by the bracing between the ribs. In connection with the bracing, at the back of the stage the circle was not completed. If it had been a complete circle the strains would have been easily calculated, but, as the circle stopped, the whole strain had to be carried across the opening by means of a very heavy steel girder weighing about six tons. In order to prevent horizontal thrust on the walls, every rib was set upon rollers.\n\nMARCH 11, 1893.\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\n\nIMPORTS.\nGLASGOW.\nMar. 2 Hibernia-Philadelphia-1,200 staves-Mitchells\nMar. 6 Alcides-Portland-169 pcs oak-J.

EDMISTON & MITCHELLS, in their monthly timber circular, dated 28th February, say:—During the month there has been no great animation in the market in respect to Canadian goods is barely maintained, and operations continue to be on a limited scale. The shipbuilding inquiry continues in an unsatisfactory condition, and very little business is being got through, buyers being decidedly adverse to operate beyond immediate requirements. There have been three auction sales held during the month—all at Greenock. The attendance at these sales was fair, but the buying was on a limited scale. During February seven vessels were launched, measuring 13,000 tons, as compared with 30,000 tons the same month last year. The fresh contracts booked register about 17,000 tons, as against 14,000 tons last February.\n\nJOHN MITCHELL & CO.,\nTIMBER MERCHANTS AND SAW-MILLERS,\nLEITH WALK SAW-MILLS, LEITH.\nImporters of American and Baltic Timber of every description.\nTELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS—\"MITCHELL, LEITH.\" Telephone No. 458.\n\nBROWNLEE & CO.,\nCITY SAW-MILLS,\nPORT DUNDAS, GLASGOW.\nBranches—\nCALEDONIAN SAW-MILLS, GRANGEMOUTH, & KILMARNOCK SAW-MILLS, KILMARNOCK.\nImporters of American and Baltic Timber of every description.

It is to be built in West Newgate Street, on the site of an old brewery.\n\nPLANTING AT BARRY LINKS.—The War Office has decided to plant with forest trees a portion of the Links at Barry, so as to provide increased shelter for the military encampments there. They have entrusted Messrs. Methven & Sons, nurserymen to the Queen, Edinburgh, with the carrying out of this important work.\n\nFORESTRY.—Messrs. Blackwood are about to reissue a very useful work, \"The Practical Forester,\" by the late Mr. J. Brown, which was first published by the firm in 1847. The book is considered of standard value, the writer having a most comprehensive knowledge of his subject, so far as regards British forests. The reissue will be revised and put into condensed form by Colonel Bailey, R.E., Lecturer on Forestry at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nTHE RESTORATION OF EAST PRINCES’ STREET GARDENS, EDINBURGH.—A vigorous beginning has been made with the restoration of the East Princes’ Street Gardens. The pieces of garden ground on each side required for railway purposes are now permanently appropriated, and the walls dividing the garden from the railway solidly built. To screen the railway as much as possible from view, an earthen mound, nearly as high as the top of the railings, will be raised just inside the retaining wall, and along it trees of good size will be planted. At the foot of this screen a narrow walk will be carried along the length of the gardens from east to west. A similar screen will be raised on the south side of the railway. The work at present in progress will cost nearly £1,500.",
