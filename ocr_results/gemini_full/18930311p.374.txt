FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases the creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ARMTAGE, WILLIS, joiner, builder, and undertaker, 13, Charlotte Street, and 1, Bower Street, Bradford. - The statutory meeting of the creditors interested herein took place on Tuesday last at the office of the Official Receiver, Bradford. From the Official Receiver's observations it appeared that the debtor was formerly employed by his father and then by his mother as joiner and builder. When in 1890 his mother gave up the business, the debtor purchased the stock, &c., for £18, and since then he had carried on the business by himself, but without success. The estate was finally left in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.
BOOTH, HENRY, builder, Romford. - The public examination of the above bankrupt took place at the Chelmsford Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar, on the 2nd inst. The statement of accounts filed by the debtor showed liabilities amounting to £1,052 1s. 4d, and a deficiency of £693 5s. 5d. The debtor was allowed to pass his examination.
BATES, THOMAS, builder and decorator, 41, Gracechurch Street, E.C.-A sitting for the bankrupt's public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard, when the accounts showed total liabilities £1,746 8s. 1d., of which £797 10s. were fully secured, and £704 18s. 1d. expected to rank, against assets estimated at £188 10s. It appeared that the bankrupt commenced business as above in June, 1882, with a capital of £2,000; that in 1882, in consequence of a heavy falling off of trade, he altered the premises at a cost of £1,100, and sub-let a part thereof; that in January, 1892, he disposed of the stock, &c., for £150, and in May obtained a tenant for the remaining portion of the premises; that his insolvency was stated to be attributable to the expenses having exceeded the takings, owing to the falling off in the business, to heavy rent, and to his inability to obtain payment from sub-tenants. Mr. Grey attended as Assistant Receiver, and, having examined the bankrupt, his Honour ordered the examination to be concluded.
CHAMBERLAIN, RICHARD, builder, Petworth and Farnham.-This bankrupt attended at the Brighton Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Jennings, for his public examination. In replying to the senior Official Receiver (Mr. A. Mackintosh), he said he commenced business in 1886 with a capital of £70. He purchased a business and had to pay for it by instalments. He could not say if these had been paid, as he was unable to obtain an account from his solicitor (Mr. Daintrey). In May, 1892, he made a private arrangement with his creditors, who agreed to accept 6s. 8d. in the pound, payable in two instalments. His solicitor guaranteed the second, but whether it had been paid he did not know, neither could he say (debtor) where a bill of sale was. He gave Mr. Daintrey the bill of sale. His father managed the business at Farnham. He admitted that he knew of his insolvency in 1892, and had contracted debts since. The examination was protracted and closed.
CHARLWOOD, CHAS. W., builder, late of East Grinstead.—The statement of affairs filed herein shows liabilities to unsecured creditors of £754 11s. 6d.; assets £111 9s. 1d.; deficiency, £642 12s. 5d. The failure is alleged by the debtor to be due to execution in connection with the bankruptcy of Franklin. The Official Receiver was appointed trustee. The calling of the first meeting of creditors was delayed owing to the debtor's illness. The statement of affairs is not yet complete. The debtor states he commenced business in July, 1890, with a capital of about £40. On the 30th November, 1892, he filed his petition in connection with the debtor's summons, and on the 20th January last he was sentenced to five years' penal servitude. The debtor's stock-in-trade was sold by auction, and the sum of £250 was realised. On account of the total sum of £262 7s. 4d., which the debtor had, under agreement, to pay on the 1st December last, undertaken in his own defence. The balance, after payment of legal expenses, of £12 7s. 4d., is in the debtor's hands. The debtor's books are in a very imperfect state; he states that he only became aware of his insolvency when he gave instructions for his petition to be filed. A summary order was made, and the Judge has appointed Mr. A. C. W. of Wandsworth Prison to be trustee.

D-LBY, H., timber merchant, Wharf, Banbury.-The examination of this debtor was continued at a sitting of the Banbury Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar. The debtor stated that the cash-book produced was the one he had always used, and he could say if it contained all the entries of receipts and payments. If the entries of payments they had not been done by himself. He said he was instructed to keep a proper inspection. He had given his solicitor his cash-book for a period of about two years preceding October 1st, 1892, in order to get a summary of the debtor's affairs prepared. He had to know if the debtor had received any money which it was not an accumulation of the debtor's takings. The debtor knew nothing whatever about it. The debtor was allowed to pass his examination.
FRICKER, HY., timber merchant, Kingston-on-Thames.-The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held on Monday, before Mr. Cecil Mercer, Official Receiver, Brighton. The Official Receiver's observations showed that the debtor was formerly a clerk, and on the death of his mother in 1886 he succeeded to the business. In 1890 his brother joined him in partnership. The debtor's brother died in December last. The debtor's liabilities were £1,200, and assets £1,000. The debtor attributed his failure to bad debts, and to his brother's illness. The debtor offered a composition of 7s. 6d. in the pound, payable in three, six, and nine months, the last instalment to be secured. The creditors resolved to accept the offer, and appointed Mr. Figg, accountant, St. Paul's Churchyard, London, as trustee to carry out the arrangement.
FOSTER, H. A., timber merchant, Great Eastern Saw Mills, Hart Street, W.C.-The statutory meeting of creditors was held on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Hope, on the application of the debtor to confirm a scheme of arrangement come to at the first meeting, of which the particulars have already appeared in this journal. In addition to the facts stated as above, Henry and Robert J. Ward were partners in a somewhat similar business carried on at Boxmoor, Herts. The Official Receiver was satisfied that all the requirements of the Act had been complied with, and he confirmed the scheme.
