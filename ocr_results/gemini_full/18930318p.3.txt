PLANT FOR HARBOUR AND SEA WORKS.
AT a recent meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Mr. Harrison Hayter, pre-sident, in the chair, a paper was read descriptive of "Plant for Harbour and Sea Works," by Mr. Walter Pitt, M.I.C.E.
The first part of the paper gave a short account of concrete-mixing machines. The difference between intermittent and continu-ous mixers was one of degree merely—the efficiency of the latter type being dependent upon the proper feeding of intermittent charges of stone, sand, and cement into the hopper.
The arrangements for dealing with concrete in the block-yard were considered. One of the earliest examples of the "Goliath" was that constructed in 1869 for the harbour works at Karachi. In its main features it consisted of a strong timber framing carrying a boiler and a set of rotary engines and pumps, which delivered direct into the hydraulic cylinder. The latter was placed on trunnions so as to give an inclined pull. The engines that drove the pumps also actuated by separate gearing (which could be worked independently) both the traverse motion and the longitudinal travelling motion of the whole machine. The maximum load was 40 tons, and the diameter of the hydraulic cylinder was 12 in. This machine worked well, although there was a slight tremor owing to only two pumps being used. With three pumps a more even delivery was effected, and vibration was reduced. The principal objection to the system was that for any considerable range of lift either a very long hydraulic cylinder was required, or a complication of multiplying gear had to be introduced.
Among more modern block-yard "Goliaths," that built for the Admiralty in 1891, for use at the Peterhead harbour of refuge works, was worthy of attention. The span of the machine was 54 ft., and its working load was 50 tons. The framework was entirely of steel. Parallel box girders, 3½ ft. in depth, were adopted, united together by heavy double horizontal gussets of U-form.
The end frames also were constructed of box section, and were strongly gusseted to the underside of the main girders. The load was lifted by an eight-part wire rope, 5 in. in circumference, reeved as a four-part rope, being double through an equalising pulley ensured equality of stress on each side of the system. The lifting-barrel was 4½ ft. in diameter. Two brakes were pro-vided, one an ordinary strap-brake, for loads up to about 12 tons, and the other a Matthews hydraulic brake, consisting of a pair of water cylinders with pistons and adjustable valves fixed in by-passes. The brakes were charged from two small tanks, in which a supply of glycerine and water was kept.
A somewhat uncommon form of lifting machines for use in the block-yard was that constructed for the Leixoes (Oporto) harbour works. It consisted of a strongly-braced truck, with sufficient space underneath the platform to pass over one concrete block; the ends of the chain slings, which were passed below the block, were connected to four nuts running in guides, and could be raised or lowered by four large screws. These were revolved simultaneously by four worm-wheels and worms geared together, the whole being driven by engines placed on the top of the platform, which also drove travelling gear. The block was raised a few inches, just sufficient to clear the floor. The machine then travelled with the block suspended, until it was brought over the block-truck; the latter ran on a sunk-road, placed at such a level that the top of the block-truck was level with the block-yard floor—a slight lowering of the screws then placed the block on the truck.
The most important piece of machinery used in harbour construction was the block-setting machine known as the "Titan." In earlier examples, the movements of this machine were all rectangular—lifting and lowering motions, a longitudinal travel, and a traverse from side to side. As an example of this type, the "Titan" constructed for the harbour works at Mormugao was described in detail.
Turning from the rectangular type to trace the history of the evolving machine, it was found that a certain process of evolution had [?]
