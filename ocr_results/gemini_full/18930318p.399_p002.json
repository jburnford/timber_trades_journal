Had all the stands been ready on the opening day, or even on Tuesday, we might have been led to pronounce the present display the best of the series. Some previous exhibitions have been sparsely attended, but that now open is a decided improvement.\nThe first stand attracting attention on entering the hall is that allotted to Mr. Francis E. Clotten, 258, High Holborn, W.C., who displays several xylolith or stone-wood specialities. This he claims to be valuable in the construction of creameries and dairies, and for small summer-houses, &c. Being a non-conductor of heat and non-absorbent, it will stand the Indian and Colonial climates with perfect success. Resisting wear and being practically unbreakable, it is recommended for flooring and roofing, while it can also be sawn for bored, polished and painted, like ordinary wood. Xylolith is made in various thicknesses and colours, and Mr. Clotten claims that it is unsurpassed for many building purposes.\nMessrs. E. Amette & Co., of the Star Works, 100, Pentonville Road, London, N., have a small display of their specialities, which include French band saws, circular saws, fret saws, and hand saws. The firm are contractors to the War Office, and undertake the sharpening and repairing of saws of every description. Their manufacture of French band saws is an important branch of business in which they have attained much distinction.\nMr. Charles Batchelor, of 208, Holloway Road, N., is present with a varied collection of ladders of various kinds, barrows, trestles, steps, &c. He has been known as an efficient ladder maker for nearly twenty years, and builders and contractors will find his present display worth seeing. Besides his manufacturing operations, Mr. Batchelor also deals in spars, poles, boards, &c.\nThe clever invention of Mr. H. J. Ford, 29, Lichfield Grove, Church End, Finchley, N., which we introduced to the notice of the trade some months ago, is shown in actual operation. These fittings provide a capital method of enabling the outside as well as the inside face of the window pane to be cleaned with safety and convenience whilst standing inside the apartment. It also allows of large articles of furniture being removed merely by swinging the sashes inward. The sash lines can be renovated without in any way interfering with the woodwork, and without the employment of any tool. Fitted to houses and shops it could hardly fail to become an inducement in letting or disposing of such property.\nIn our Special Issue we described the fireproof floors and partitions constructed with the patent corrugated iron sheets made by Messrs. H. Cunnah Wright & Co., of 28, Gracechurch Street, E.C., and St. John’s Road, Moseley Road, Birmingham. This system is illustrated at the Building Exhibition, and is attracting considerable attention on account of its cheapness, the rapidity with which it can be erected, and the satisfactory result when finished. As we have so recently described this excellent system, further comment would appear to be superfluous.\nStreet paving is an important matter in most towns, and hence the value of the display at the stand occupied by Messrs. John Hampson & Co., Bank Chambers, Tooley Street, S.E. This is made up of an exceedingly hard, non-slippery Irish paving, for which the firm have, we believe, the sole sale in this country. The stone is said\n\nAs supplied to H.M. Government, &c.\nPREVENTS INCRUSTATION IN BOILERS\n\"CLIMAX\" BOILER FLUID\nHARMLESS & ECONOMICAL\n\nMARCH 18, 1893.\nBEACH, WILLIAM, builder, Brondesbury Road, Brondesbury, N.W. — The public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Giffard, showing total liabilities £8,574 13s. 5d., and assets £1,388 5s. is expected to rank for £1,408 10s. In reply to the Senior Official Receiver, the bankrupt stated that he formerly carried on business in partnership with his brother at Sheffield. He came to London and commenced business on his own account in 1888. He attributed his failure to the falling off in his business, to a guarantee given by another person, and to the fact that he was supplied with building materials of bad quality in progress at Exeter Road, Brondesbury. Bankrupt was allowed to pass his examination.\nBISHOP, GEORGE, builder, Boscombe, in partnership with Henry Bishop, of Boscombe.—Bankrupt has a deficiency of £1,300. Mr. Machonochie, through Mr. W. H. V. Bythway, of Poole Bankruptcy Court for his discharge. The Official Receiver reported that bankrupt had omitted to keep proper books of account, continued to trade after knowing of his insolvency, and brought on his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous trade. The learned Judge said the case was a very bad one. Bankrupt had begun with nothing, and had not only lost everything, but had been injuring honest tradesmen. The only good feature was that he was examined as to the ownership of some property at Southampton, but said he knew nothing about it, and the learned Judge suspended the discharge for two years.\nGILBERTHORPE, JOHN, builder and builder, Charlton Street, Sheffield.—This bankruptcy came up for public examination at the Sheffield Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday last week. The Official Receiver said the first meeting of creditors was only held on the previous day, and he thought he should ask for an adjournment. The bankrupt had received considerable sums of money, and he would have to ask him to furnish accounts of how he had disposed of them. Finally, it was decided to adjourn the examination for a month.\nHOOPER, JOSEPH, timber contractor, Newport, Mon.—An application was made at the Newport (Mon.) Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, before his Honour Judge Owen, for the discharge of the above debtor. The proceedings in reference to a contract with Mr. C. Bevan, at Newport. A Mr. Hutchins, an architect, was to be the sole arbitrator in the matter. The debtor put in a claim for £1,000, but he found had not been specified in the contract, telling Mr. Hutchins of the omission, and asking that it would be allowed for, and he was told that when the time came for a settlement, the extras would be allowed for. Mr. Hutchins said there had been no such conversation, and the extras would not be allowed for. The debtor stopped after putting in £1,000 worth of work. The Official Receiver said he was afraid debtor had fallen into the hands of the “Philistines.” Finally his Honour suspended the debtor’s discharge for two years.\nHERMON, PERCY (trading as Hearn & Co. and Hermon & Co.), builder and contractor, Bayswater and St. James’s.—According to the Official Receiver’s observations, debtor commenced business in 1878 in partnership with his father at 18a, St. James’s, and Beak Street, Pimlico, with whom he traded as “Hearn & Hermon” until December, 1883, when his father retired, and he took over the business at a valuation of £6,000; that he then took into partnership his clerk, who brought in no capital (the debtor’s capital at that time being £5,000), and in March, 1886, he opened a branch at Craven Terrace, and 18a, Queenswater, purchasing the business of Mr. William Hearn for £3,000 (which was subsequently paid), and also retaining the premises at 21, King Street, St. James’s. The business was carried on under the styles of “Hearn & Co.” and “Hermon & Co.” until December, 1891, when the partnership was dissolved, and he (the debtor) took over an agreement for the business under the same style and at the same addresses (the office at Beak Street being relinquished in December, 1892), up to the date of the receiving order.\n\nTHE THA...\nTIMBER WHARF, SAV...\nDOORS,\nSASHES AND FRAMES,\nSTAIRCASES,\nSHOP FITTINGS,\nBAR FITTINGS,\nPIPER'S WHA...",
