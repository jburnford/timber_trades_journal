Milne & Sons (Limited), Milton House Works, Edinburgh, and 111, St. Vincent Street, Glasgow, state that they are experiencing a very gratifying increased demand for this ware. It is composed of wood fibre reduced to a pulp, and in this condition moulded into shape by means of hydraulic pressure. Afterwards it is slowly baked hard, and by this process it becomes tougher than the wood of which it was originally a portion. The idea is, of course, American, and it seems to be \"catching on\" wonderfully well in this country. One of its latest patrons is H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, who has purchased one of the handsomest and most expensive bath-tubs ever made in this material. It is embossed and traced in gold, is supplied with heavy silver-plated fittings, and was sent direct from New York to Marlborough House. The latest uses to which this material is being put are as water-closet seats and flushing-cisterns, purposes for which it seems admirably adapted. The ware may be stained and grained so as to imitate any of the natural woods, and is actually better than these for the purposes above referred to, because it neither warps, absorbs moisture, nor harbours germs. In the case of flushing-cisterns, no metal lining is required to hide an unsightly article, as the outside may be stained and polished to match the surroundings. The London agents are Milne, Sons, & Macfie, 60, Holborn Viaduct, London, E.C.\n\nThe Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\n\nEDINBURGH ARCHITECTURAL ASSOCIATION.\nAt the last meeting of this association, Mr. W. W. Robertson, the president, in the chair, Dr. Rowand Anderson read a paper on \"Dunblane Cathedral,\" which has been restored under his direction. He explained that the tower was the only remaining part of the old Culdee Church which was supposed to have existed at Dunblane, and that the building in other respects dated from the thirteenth century. The cathedral suffered greatly at the Reformation, and until the beginning of the present century, when the chancel was again opened as a place of worship, it seemed to have been disused and neglected. There was not so much architectural history in the building as in many cathedrals, and this was accounted for by the energy of Bishop Clemens, the moderate size of the structure, and its situation on the high road between Stirling and Perth. Among the points of special interest in the cathedral, from an architectural point of view, were the west door, the absence of tracery in some of the clerestory windows of the nave, the comparative smallness of the chancel arch, and also the presence of two openings above it, the blank wall on the north side of the choir, and the long apartment on the north side of the choir. Mention was also made of the vesica window in the west wall of the nave, of which, Dr. Anderson said, Mr. Ruskin had written so much in his Edinburgh letters.\n\nGLASGOW.—Messrs. Robert M'Alpine & Sons, 81, St. Vincent Street, have secured the contract for the new purifiers and meters for the Dawsholm Gasworks.

In the Police Commissioners have under consideration the construction of an intercepting sewer at an estimated cost of £17,000, the building of a retaining wall along the bank of the Kelvin at an estimated cost of £6,000, and the making of a road at a cost of £2,260.\n\nJOHN MITCHELL & CO.,\nTIMBER MERCHANTS AND SAW-MILLERS,\nLEITH WALK SAW-MILLS, LEITH.\nImporters of American and Baltic Timber of every description.\nTELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS—\"MITCHELL, LEITH.\"\nTelephone No. 458.\n\nBROWNLEE & CO.,\nCITY SAW-MILLS,\nPORT DUNDAS, GLASGOW.\nBranches—\nCALEDONIAN SAW-MILLS, GRANGEMOUTH, & KILMARNOCK SAW-MILLS, KILMARNOCK.\nImporters of American and Baltic Timber of every description.
