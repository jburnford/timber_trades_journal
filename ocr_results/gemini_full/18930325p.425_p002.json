K. Rollit, M.P., presided, and there was a large and influential attendance.\nMr. Mundella, M.P., occupied a seat on the right of the chair.\nIn opening the proceedings, the President said that much had been accomplished by the association.\nThey had helped to secure greater safety for both life and property by electrical communications with lightships and round the coast ; in demanding postal, telegraphic, and telephonic reforms ; in urging upon the attention of the Government the need of reconciling and reforming our laws as to the rating of machinery, and of exempting it from local taxation ; and in enforcing the duty of dealing with the establishment of the decimal system.\nLast year was a bad business year, almost the world over ; and the present one was, so far, scarcely more hopeful.\nThe continued contraction in our home and foreign trades and in both our imports and exports, in railway traffic, in shipping, and in the bankers' clearances, the increase in the number of insolvencies, and the Board of Trade reports upon, and the percentages of non-employment in, the skilled labour trades—all these only left the consolation that what had occurred might be a step, though a downward one, towards a better and safer economic condition, and towards clearing an atmosphere clouded by the financial difficulties of South America, and, to a less extent, of Australia.\nFor the moment, the railway question properly riveted popular attention.\nThe railway companies were now conceding reductions, reversions, and rebates ; they were wisely conferring with their customers, and they had left with the traders the lesson that such a commercial catastrophe, must never occur again, but must be previously and permanently provided for by our mercantile law.\nFor the moment the traders were content to wait the end of March, but when Easter had come and gone, and upon the publication of the re-revised rates, each Chamber should at once compare them with the actual rates in force before and after January 1st respectively.\nSir Albert Rollit proceeded to urge that increased powers should be given to the Board of Trade.\nLastly, on the subject of railways, he would suggest that when the line was cleared of the goods train the interests of passengers might well be considered ; and such railway reforms as more punctuality, less overcrowding, through\n\ncarriages, better times and connections on non-competition lines, and the zone systems of tariffs, in the interests of the public, might well be carried out.\nIn conclusion, he dealt with the subject of tariffs and treaties, and spoke of their influence on trade.\nHe then moved the adoption of the report.\nMr. J. F. Firth, the vice-president, seconded the motion.\nMr. Mundella said it was perfectly true the association met at a time of gloom and depression.\nDuring the last 33 years, however, he could recall much darker days than the present in our social history.\nBut he trusted that the bottom of the depression had been touched.\nWhen they considered the great financial disturbances which occurred two or three years ago, what tremendous interests were involved, the distrust which they caused, and the fact that nations with whom we had been accustomed to trade were in discredit, and the further fact that even now there were many of them that were unwilling to trust, it was hardly surprising that we were passing through a period of trade depression.\nOn the question of railway rates, he considered it a great mistake committed by the large railway companies of this country that in a time of severe commercial and agricultural depression they should have attempted to raise, as it were, the legislation of 1888 to raise the cost of transport.\nIt was a great mistake in their own interests, and it had done much to discredit them in the eyes of the commercial community.\nHe was glad to recognise that at the present moment the railway companies were taking steps, so to speak, to re-establish their claims upon the confidence of the traders.\nMr. Boulton, of the London Chamber, who had been negotiating with them lately on behalf of the timber trade, might be congratulated upon a success which even the last President of the Board of Trade failed to achieve, for he believed that the timber trade was about to resume its old relations with the railway companies in respect to rates, measurement, and the like.\nHe hoped that would be the case generally throughout the industries of the country.\nSeveral important resolutions were agreed to, that moved by Mr. S. B. Boulton to this effect :—\" That, having in view the growing desire for the extension of conciliation and arbitration for labour disputes, it is expedient that some recognition on the part of the Government should be bestowed on such conciliation boards as have been formed or may be formed in connection with Chambers of Commerce and otherwise, and after inspection and approval of their rules, bye-laws, and constitution by the Board of Trade.\"\nThe association then proceeded to consider the question of railway rates, and Mr. Wigham (Dublin) moved :—\" That the executive council of this association be requested to watch the further proceedings of railway companies respecting rates, more particularly in regard to the carriage of foreign imports, which, it is alleged, in certain instances have been carried at preferential rates, lower than those levied on home produce.\"\nMr. Harvey Daw moved, as a rider :—\" That any general advance in railway rates without due regard to what the traffic will bear is a serious hardship to the trading community, and that special powers should be conferred on the Board of Trade, or a tribunal acting under its authority, to determine in all cases when applied to what rate is equitable and reasonable.\"\nThe rider was adopted.\nThe Bristol Chamber proposed, as a further rider :—\" That it is desirable that the decisions embodied in the various Railway Rates Bills already passed into law, instituting the payment of carriage on timber, deals, battens, boards, and scantlings by machine weight instead of measurement as hitherto, be reversed, and that this association support and, if necessary, introduce a Bill in the present Session of Parliament for this purpose.\"\nThis last proposal was negatived, and the first motion and rider were agreed to.\nThe Foreign Office have been very active in conferring with the various Chambers of Commerce throughout the kingdom.\nMany communications from the Foreign Office have been received concerning certificates of origin for Spain, accompanied with forms of Acts, translations of Royal orders, &c., appertaining to them.\nIt would appear that the slightest irregularity in them causes the rejection of the goods until the certificates are put in proper form.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Government, in fact, have expressed their willingness to receive certificates of origin issued by Chambers of Commerce.\nAs to Switzerland, another communication states that Earl Rosebery has obtained for British commercial travellers in this country the benefit of the provisions of the Swiss law of 1892, and that on production of a certificate, called a 'legitimation card,' they will be able to trade for commercial houses established in this country.\nA letter from a firm announced that under a commercial treaty of 1891 between Germany and Switzerland, the German Chambers of Commerce issue certificates of this kind, and these, and they are printed in both English and German, are given in both languages.\nAs indicating the extent to which Continental Governments recognise the fact that Chambers of Commerce are the best means of extending the commerce of the world, a letter has been received stating that the Belgrade representatives are increasing their staff, and will push their trade with renewed endeavour on the opening of the navigation.\nThey have already had opened orders for goods on to stock, and will be glad of the opportunity of quoting for any superior quality of timber, and hope to be able to forward orders for large numbers of deals and battens for the Continental markets.\n\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must be understood that the following information is simply a record of what has taken place in the London Gazette, and we do not vouch for its accuracy.\nIt is simply a legal record of the facts therein contained.]\n\nADLINGTON, JOHN, 13, Peacock-street, Walworth, and The Lord Bognor, Bognor, builder.—Public examination May 4, at 11.30, at Bankruptcy-buildings, Carey-street, W.C. Debtor's accounts show liabilities £1,057 1s. 11d., and debts expected to rank £507 1s. 11d. ; assets £21 15s. 4d.\nFrom 1883 to 1889 he was in partnership with his brother, trading as Adlington Bros., at Walworth.\nMr. Registrar Linklater ordered the examination to be concluded.\n\nCox, M., 10, St. John's-road, East Ham, and Colthurst-road, Leytonstone, builder.—At the London Bankruptcy Court, on Wednesday, Duke Graham and Co., timber merchants, May & Hassell, timber merchants, and Reynolds and Co., timber merchants, were returned as creditors.\nYour reporter was unable to obtain any further particulars.\nMr. Registrar Linklater made an order concluding the examination.",
