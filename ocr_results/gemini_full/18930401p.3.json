Some additional cargoes of yellow pine are due, including one of very considerable size. There is a small cargo of teakwood due here from Rangoon.\nThe home timber trade has undergone no change since last report. Outside of shipbuilding the air amount of timber is going into consumption, but not sufficiently to clear the ponds to the extent desirable at this time of year. Altogether the tone of business is slow and the prospect not bright. It is rare now to hear of a shipbuilding order, and we therefore note with pleasure that Russell & Co. have contracted to build two sailing barks of 600 tons each for Messrs. Honeyman, & Co., Glasgow.\nThe Glebe Sugar Company, Limited, have decided, instead of rebuilding their works on Cleston Street, recently burned down, to put up large fireproof stores to meet the company's present requirements on Irn Square, for the purpose of carrying on an extensive scale the manufacture of their cereal products. The new buildings will be double the size of the old works in the le Street. The contract has been let to Th J. & R. Houston & Co., Greenock, and, & Co. will hold an auction sale on the 5th inst.\n\nLEITH.\nThe arrivals he past week are small, consisting of 63 poplar logs, 70 hickory logs, and 1,103 boards oak per Montana, from Baltimore; 4,560 pitprops and a few deals per Stettin; 4,688 battens and some whitewood, per Frithjofs, from Gothenburg. The joys cargo is for Mr. D. W. Beattie, and is the first of the small Swedish summer sailers usually arriving here about this time.\nBusiness continues fine, and trade is on the whole good, although still without any special feature. There was no public sale last week, and there is nothing special to report in private business. With the new season a large shipment is expected, and prices for the new season there is certain to be a keen competition.\nThe timber traders are still negotiating with the North British Railway Company for a reduction in rates, and a favourable result is anticipated.\n\nPrice 6d.\n\nBARKS\nOak Bark, Wood.\n\nHOLLAND AND GERMANY,\nQuotations supplied by Shippers' Agents for Principal Stocks.\n165, Fenchurch Street, London, E.C.\n11, Gracechurch Street, London, E.C.\n6d.

It would seem as though some of the organic tissues of the wood (not the sap) decomposed under certain conditions of the surrounding atmosphere (as in close, damp, confined air), and that they thus furnish, as it were, a soil for the growth of the fungi, which in turn distegrated the remaining portions of the tissues by their mere mechanical expansion in growing. The wood becomes, in fact, reduced to a mere powder, and may then be rubbed away by the finger, sometimes with a rapidity quite alarming. There is also this particular danger about dry rot, viz., that the germs of the fungi producing it are carried easily and in all directions in a building wherein it once displays itself, without necessity for actual contact between the affected or the sound wood, whereas the communication of the disease resulting from the putrefactive fermentation or wet rot only takes place by actual contact. It may possibly be the case that woods grown in certain soils are more exposed to dry rot than others are, and that the germs of the fungoids are taken up by the spongioles of the roots; for timber grown where large fungi abound are said to be more exposed to this disease (dry rot) than those which are grown on dry, well-drained soils. At any rate, wood kept for any length of time in situations where it is exposed to become covered with fungi is very likely to \"take on\" dry rot at an early period. Much of the timber arriving from the north of Europe leaves the ships in a state which seems to contain the germs of decay. The method of stacking the timber and deals in some of our docks is also often very dangerous. From whatever source the fungoid growth producing dry rot may proceed, if once it should be recognised to exist in a building, the affected parts, and all the woodwork around them, should at once be removed. If the various processes for preserving timber should not then be applicable, great precautions should be observed to cut off the access of moisture and to ensure a free circulation of air round the newly-fixed wood.\n\nBUILDING NEWS.\nTENDERS OPEN.\nFor the supply of timber to the Edinburgh and Leith Corporations Gas Commissioners. Tenders to Mr. James McJack, 28, Waterloo Place, Edinburgh, by the 5th inst.\nFor the supply of British wood and foreign timber and ash handles for the Police Commissioners. Tenders by the 15th inst. to Mr. J. Young, 64, Cochrane Street, Glasgow.\n\nFOREST GEOGRAPHY.\nTHERE is, perhaps, no more agreeable or practical way of grasping the geography of a country than by a study of its forest flora, says Mr. George Cadell. The empire of Japan, which stretches from the 24th deg. to the 51st deg. of latitude, and consists of a long chain of islands, some of which enjoy summer, while others endure winter nearly all the year round. But far greater interest attaches to such a general description if we study the five zones of forest flora into which this long stretch of territory is readily divisible. And the forest officials of Japan have given to each of these zones a name borrowed from the tree of the first class which is more frequently met with within its limits. Thus the most southern region they call the region of the Ficus Wightiana. If we remember that there are some eighty species of ficus in India, of which the common banyan is the best-known example, the climate of a tropical country is at once suggested. Proceeding northwards, we come to the region of the Pinus Thunbergii, the common black pine of Japan, which flourishes in a climate where snow rarely falls and never lies on the ground. Coming next to a climate more nearly resembling our own, we arrive at the region of the Fagus sylvatica, or common beech, then to the fourth zone, distinguished by the name of the Abies Veitchii, now widely known in this country, the introduction of",
