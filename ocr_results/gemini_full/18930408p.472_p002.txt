REVIEWS.
Handrailing Complete in Eight Lessons. By J. S. Goldthorp. London: Crosby Lockwood & Son.
Mr. Goldthorp is a practical teacher at Halifax, and this little work is likely to be of considerable value. The arrangement of the book is excellent, and the standard kept in view by the author has been to enable the student to become a [?] lar mechanical method, and to help him to a thoroughly intelligent knowledge upon which he can base original ideas. We heartily commend the work to teachers and students. It contains about forty drawings and over 150 exercises.
How to Deal With It. By D. Schedule D, and How W. Flint. London: John Heywood.
This is a little pamphlet of about twenty pages, intended to be a short and easy guide for traders in making income-tax returns, appealing, &c. The author claims to have provided business men with a clear and concise manual of directions based upon experience gained in the course of interviews with surveyors and commissioners on behalf of clients.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BALL & BROWN, builders, Brecknock Road, Camden Town, and Crouch End.—A sitting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The joint accounts showed liabilities £1,389 14s. 2d., of which £1,130 18s is unsecured, and assets £604 18s. 10d. These accounts have been verified by Mr. Ball only, owing to the decease, since the date of the receiving order, of his partner. It appeared that the business was originally carried on by Mr. Ball in partnership with another person, who retired in 1883, under which a composition was paid. That the partnership of Ball & Brown was commenced at Michaelmas, 1888, Mr. Brown introducing £350 that date, and a further sum of £150 in August, 1889. That in September, 1891, another private arrangement was made, and a composition of 5s in the pound paid to the creditors. That the business consisted of building and decorative work under contract, and that the insolvency was attributable to losses under various contracts and to bad trade. The examination of Mr. Ball was concluded; that of Brown, who has died, being adjourned sine die.

CARTER, WILLIAM, 15 and 16, Sherbourne Road, Balsall Heath, builder.—A meeting of the creditors of this bankrupt was held on the 30th ult. The statement of affairs showed the liabilities to be £331 18s. 8d., and the assets £101 17s. 3d, leaving a deficiency of £230 1s. 5d. The report of the Official Receiver states that the bankrupt up to 1878 was engaged as a bricklayer. In that year he commenced business without capital as a builder at 16, Sherbourne Road, Balsall Heath. At the commencement of 1892 he accepted a contract to build a villa in Oakfield Road, Balsall Heath, for £470, and to alter a house in Stratford Road for £215. In consequence of the strike in April, 1892, and his illness about that time, both these contracts resulted in a loss which the bankrupt had been unable to recover from. The two contracts were finished about August, 1892, and the bankrupt became aware at that time there was a deficiency. No contracts have been accepted since then, and the bankrupt has been engaged upon jobbing work. Creditors commenced to press in December last, and a private meeting was held on the 17th January, and an offer of composition of 6s. 8d. in the pound submitted, which the bankrupt's friends were willing to pay if the creditors were unanimous. The liabilities amounted to about £300, and the assets to £80 17s. Three of the creditors declined to assent and the present proceedings were instituted. On the 14th February, 1893, the bankrupt sold his pony, harness, and trap for £23 10s., out of which he paid £12 to his solicitor on account of the payments incident to this petition, and states he has lived on the balance. The insolvency was attributed to illness, bad trade, bricklayers' strike, and losses on contracts. The case being a summary one, the Official Receiver is the trustee.
GROVER & GROVER, timber merchants, Kentish Town Wharf, Kentish Town.—Under this failure the usual summary of accounts has been issued by Mr. H. Brougham, Official Receiver. The total liabilities are returned at £47,067 3s. 6d., of which £15,797 18s. 3d. are expected to rank, against assets valued at £25,203 10s, 10d., thus showing a surplus of £9,405 12s. 7d. The debtors commenced business in 1871 as pianoforte manufacturers in partnership with their father, who retired for two years later. In 1877 they purchased the timber merchant's business at Kentish Town Wharf for £16,000, and have traded there down to the failure. In 1810 they purchased about 35 acres of freehold building land at Edmonton, in connection with which they estimate they have incurred a loss of about £10,000, on unrecouped outlay amounting to about £40,000. They attribute their failure to depreciation in the value of stock, plant, &c., and to loss on trading, particularly in endeavouring to compete with the foreign trade. The 20th instant is fixed for the public examination of the debtors.
COWPER, JOSEPH, builder, 181, Brixton Road and 55, Holland Street, Brixton, S.W.—Upon the application of Messrs. Watson, Sons, & Co., a receiving order was made in this case last week under a creditor's petition. The debtor states that he resides at 181, Brixton Road, and his furniture there is covered by a bill of sale for £30, held by the Central Advance Corporation, Charing Cross. His assets consisted of building plant and materials of a value of about £105. The amount of the debt was not stated.
MEECH, H. W., shop window fitter, 63, Wood Street, E.C.—This debtor, trading as Meech Brothers, has filed his petition, and last week, upon the application of Mr. B. F. Linnett, the usual receiving order was made. The debtor states that he removed from 112 to 65, Wood Street about three months since. He estimates his stock at about £300 at cost, and book debts £200. It was a cash and credit business. The sheriff was in possession under an execution. The debtor adds that the household furniture at his private residence belongs to his wife. The amount of his liabilities did not transpire.
MORTER, JAMES, builder, &c., Fort Lane, Chatsworth Road, of Albert Road, Stratford.—The first meeting of the creditors interested herein was held on Wednesday week before Mr. E. L. Hough. Messrs. Ingle, Cooper & Holmes, attended on behalf of the debtor. The accounts showed assets £9,597. The other side of the account showed total liabilities £8,725. There was therefore a nominal surplus of £872. The Official Receiver (Mr. Hough) said there were several unfinished contracts on hand which were represented by the debtor to be valuable contracts, and ought in the interest of the creditors to be proceeded with so as to avoid any forfeiture of the retention moneys or plant. Mr. Jas. Worley, of Leadenhall Street, chartered accountant, had (the debtor stated) prepared to go on with those contracts, and accordingly he (O.R.) had made the appointment, and Mr. Worley had since been carrying on the contracts. A scheme had been submitted on behalf of the debtor, but he had not had sufficient time to digest it and report thereon to the meeting. It provided for the vesting of the estate in the hands of Mr. Worley upon trust for the creditors, to carry on the business and to realise the assets so far as might be necessary for the purposes of the scheme. To pay the costs, charges, and preferential claims in full, and a composition, of 10s. in the pound to the creditors by four equal instalments, payable on the 15th January, March, May, and July, 1894, respectively. That upon payment of the said composition, or upon security for the payments being given to the satisfaction of the trustee and committee of inspection, the assets remaining vested in the hands of the trustee were to be re-assigned to the debtor. The trustee was to employ the debtor at a reasonable remuneration, and was to advance or borrow money to carry on the business, security of a first charge upon the estate being given. Those were shortly the terms, and if the creditors desired to entertain them, it would be necessary to adjourn the meeting. A creditor thought the scheme was hardly a desirable one, as it asked the creditors to wait ten months before receiving the first instalment, and although the accounts showed a considerable surplus they were asked to accept 10s. in the pound in full settlement of their debts. Mr. Worley, the special manager, said the principal contract was for the erection of a board school at West Ham for over £16,500. One of the conditions was that the authorities were entitled to retain 10 per cent. of the amount of the contract until the work was finished, and finally approved. That meant the retention of £1,650, and the same course was adopted with other contracts, so that until they had been completed the stock-in-trade, machinery, &c., could not be realised, and it would be vain to hold out any expectation of receiving the first instalment before January next. The chairman inquired the cause of the debtor's position, and in reply Mr. Worley said that for some months past the debtor had been hampered by pressure on the part of creditors, but under the scheme those difficulties would disappear, and with the advantage of the capital that would be introduced they would be able to get the proper and usual discounts, &c. The meeting was adjourned for three weeks.
