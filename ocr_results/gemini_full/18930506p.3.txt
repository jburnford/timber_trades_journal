ROSS-SHIRE.—The contract of Mr. MacDonald, builder, Inverness, has been accepted for the restoration of the Beauly stone bridge, which was partially destroyed by the great flood of last year. The amount of the contract is £4,896.
At the meeting of the Glasgow Philosophical Society Mr. W. F. Murray, of the Caledonia Pottery, Rutherglen, read a paper "On a New System of using Gaseous Fuel in Firing Pottery Ware." In explaining his system he remarked on the extravagant use of fuel by potters and the economies that had been introduced by the adoption of scientific methods of obtaining and applying heat in the metal industries. Similar economies, he said, awaited the pottery trade, which were to be reached by the same paths as had led to comparative prosperity among metal-workers.
EDINBURGH.—Acting on the instructions of the Edinburgh and Leith Gas Commission, Mr. Linton, engineer of the Leith works, has prepared a report on the subject of oil gas—a matter upon which Mr. Mitchell, engineer of the Edinburgh works, reported to the states that he has no hesitation in advising the Commissioners to erect plant at the Edinburgh works for the manufacture of oil gas as soon as it is possible to do so. The report has been submitted to which the committee have unanimously approved of it, and have instructed the engineer to prepare plans and estimates for the construction of the necessary works at New Street.
