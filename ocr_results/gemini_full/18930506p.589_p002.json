H., builder, Thornton Heath.—At the Croydon Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday the debtor appeared for public examination. The debtor, who commenced business about forty years ago with a capital of about £4,000, attributed his failure to the action of the petitioning creditors. For the first twenty years he did very well, but more recently had been unfortunate in contracts. The examination was adjourned.\nDUFFY, M. C. & SON, LIM.—The creditors of this company met at Carey Street last Wednesday, before Mr. A. S. Cully, Assistant Receiver, to consider as to the appointment of a liquidator and committee of inspection. The company was formed in May, 1887, to acquire and continue the business of W. C. Duffy (trading as M. C. Duffy & Son), wood flooring manufacturer, turner, and box and packing case maker, carried on at Storks Road, Bermondsey, and Vauxhall Terrace, Lambeth. The winding-up order was made last February upon the petition of creditors, under which accounts have been filed, showing debts £3,203 10s. 10d., assets £816 15s. 2d., and a deficiency of £18,176 15s. 8d. as regards contributories. The failure of the company is attributed to the destruction of the works at Bermondsey by a fire in April, 1891. The proofs having been dealt with, the Chairman stated that there were several points in connection with the case requiring careful investigation. The transfer of the business to a company appeared to be the result of pressure brought upon Mr. Duffy by Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co., to which firm Mr. Duffy was largely indebted at the date of the transfer, as out of a total indebtedness of nearly £15,000 about £13,000 was owing to Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. The effect of the transfer appeared to be that Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. not only received shares as security for the amount of their debt, but they practically obtained entire control of the business, and had seats on the Board of Directors. Another point calling for inquiry was with regard to the fire that occurred on the Bermondsey premises in April, 1891. The money received from the insurance company as compensation was at the present moment in the hands of Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co., who claimed a right to retain it as a set off against their debt. It appeared that that firm acted as agents for the company in regard to the insurance, and in that capacity they held the policies, but so far as he (the chairman) was able to ascertain, no arrangement was in force under which they had power to retain the money as security for their debt. The amount in question was £3,662, and it would be a matter for serious consideration whether steps should not be taken against Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. to recover that money. The actual business before the meeting was to consider as to the appointment of a liquidator and a committee of inspection. With regard to the tangible assets, the Official Receiver had in hand a sum of £122 13s. 10d., and anticipated receiving further amounts which would enable about £700 to be divided amongst the creditors by way of dividend. In considering the desirability of commencing proceedings against Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co., the creditors would have to remember that the costs thereof would probably have to be defrayed from the assets belonging to the estate. Mr. Brown (Duus, Brown, & Co.) said it appeared to him that whatever steps were taken with regard to the money held by his firm, the general body of creditors would not reap any material benefit, and there could not be sufficient to pay the unsecured debts in full. The assets were sufficient for his firm to pay its own creditors, but a debt of £2,043 due to the company was a corresponding loss. The fire money would be in the interim placed on deposit in independent personal names. The cost of liquidation was likely to be more moderate than the Official Receiver's department might be. He would move that a liquidator with a committee of inspection be appointed. The chairman said the creditors would be wise in allowing the Official Receiver to appoint a liquidator, as otherwise they would have to find the money to cover the probable cause of action for the recovery of the money. The chairman remarked that if the creditors appointed a liquidator they would be represented on the committee of inspection, and clients he should do everything possible. (Hear, hear.) The business of the meeting that had been arranged for had been already disposed of, and the question of the appointment of a liquidator was one remaining for consideration. It would be better to appoint a liquidator at that meeting, as it would save a short time and expense. He would leave their number with the creditors. With Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. out, to adjusting the matter would undoubtedly be much better for the creditors if an amicable arrangement could be made instead of allowing the matter to go into the assets. He, therefore, proposed that the meetings should be adjourned. The resolution was then unanimously put to the meeting and carried. In reply to the chairman, Mr. Brown said that at the present moment he could not say that his father's address was known. He did not know that his father was in any way connected with the company, he did not know that he was a director. The chairman: He was a director. The Receiver, or liquidator, would find him out. (Laughter). The chairman: He was a director in your father's absence. Mr. Brown: Yes, unfortunately it was so. (Renewed laughter). Mr. Brown said he was then formerly a director.

A statement of affairs was submitted showing unsecured liabilities £1,126 18s. 11d., and fully secured £24,000. The assets consisted of an estimated surplus from securities held by fully secured creditors of £1,800, which are scheduled as creditors for £25,800.\nAlliance Iron Company, Limited, 46, Queen Victoria Street, E.C.\nAird & Son, Belvedere Road, Lambeth, S.E.\nAkers T., 1, Great Portland Street, W.\nChaul & Son, near Crawley, Sussex\nCarpenter W., Queen Street, Hammersmith\nEdwards J.
