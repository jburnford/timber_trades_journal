SCOTCH CUSTOMS.
UNDER the title of “Sixty Years Among Saw-mills,” Mr. J. E. Emerson is contributing a series of articles to the North-Western Lumberman. In his last contribution he says:—
Scotland as a whole is the best timber land of Great Britain, and has, I think, more mills for sawing and working timber and lumber. This probably is largely due to her numerous shipbuilding interests, and remarkable enterprise and rigid economy.
Scotland has the best monetary and banking system of any part of the world. Shipbuilding was at one time carried on on the Thames in London, and its immediate vicinity, but as many shipbuilders were comparatively poor and there was a panic in England, and interest jumped as it often has from 2 to 10 per cent. in one day, and the bank of England suspended specie payment, as it did during the wars of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Crimean War, it was dangerous to be in debt and have notes falling due. Sir Walter Scott wrote under the assumed name of “Mullecar Mulla-gruder” (if I have spelled it correctly) and opposed Scotland’s establishing the monetary system of England.
For more than one hundred years interest in Scotland has not been more than 2 per cent. When I was there, there were thirteen parent banks having from fifty to a hundred subordinate banks all through the Highlands and Lowlands. These small banks circulated the paper money of their parent bank, but were not obliged under the law to redeem in specie. If specie was wanted the parent bank was resorted to.
It cost over 15,000,000 dollars to dredge the Clyde so ships could be launched. I was exceedingly interested in learning the method of doing business in shipbuilding, so I had a bank president explain it. Said he:—
“We want to know that a shipbuilder is a practical workman and manager. Such a man gets for the Cunard Line or East India, or a reliable nation, shipbuilding to the amount of say 5,000,000 dollars, and comes to us for a loan of 100,000 dollars until his first payment, which is when the outside or frame is ready for the machinery, and so on at each stage as the work progresses, until launched, when all is then due. We get the contract at say 1½ per cent. interest; if awarded to us he brings us his contract as our security, and sends all of his bills, even his labour bill, for us to pay, and we pay them up to the sum loaned. He comes and says that he is ready for an inspector, and we order one that is furnished by our Government. Soon he brings in his receipt that it is done satisfactorily, and we then send the receipt to the parties he is building for and draw on them for the first payment. It comes, and we place it to his credit, and then go on again, settling every six months, charging him interest for the exact time that he has had the money, and allowing him half interest for what lies in our bank not used by him. It costs us ½ per cent. to handle money, including all expenses, so that whatever we receive over that is clear profit.”
MAY 13, 1893.
Some years ago I was for several weeks stopping at Asheville, North Carolina, and made the acquaintance there of a young Scotchman who represented a Scotch company in Glasgow. He was purchasing large tracts of timber land and importing Scotch families to settle on it, and was operating several portable circular saw-mills used for slabbing timber, which was shipped in square shape to Scotland, where he told me it was resawed by band mills and bench circulars into whatever was wanted there. He said by settling the land which they sold on long payments at low interest the timber cost them nothing.
In all of their doings I found the Scotch a farseeing people and in no way what we may call sharpers. They lay their plans often generations ahead, and what we call “clannish” Scotchmen look after the interests of Scotchmen wherever found.
No country is more careful to preserve its relics than Scotland and the Scottish people. While in Edinburgh I took one day to wander through Hawthornden. This is a region of beauty in shade trees and romance. In Scott’s poems he says: “Johnson sat in Drummond’s social shade,” Johnson walking all the way from London to enjoy these shades. Under the old mansion are those wonderful caves hewed out of solid rock. I was permitted to enter a tunnel hewed or cut through the rock about 100 ft. long, where we entered a room. On the sides were an immense quantity of pigeon holes, and here was an old sword, rickety and rusty, said to have been used by William Wallace. They are now called Wallace’s caves, and it is said that for many years he occupied these apartments. These dreary rooms are located near the steep banks of a brook and have pigeon holes hewed through for light and air. It seemed to me that dire necessity alone during Scotland’s tempestuous days could have induced any human being to occupy so dreary a mansion. I finally came out at Rosslin, where I enjoyed a lunch better than at any hotel in all the kingdom, probably because it was so nicely prepared by the neatly-dressed and pretty little Scotch lassie.
I visited Melrose Abbey and the residence of Sir Walter Scott. On this mansion are carved various inscriptions like “up with ye suiters of Selkirk, 1525.” I was in Sir Walter’s room, which contained many relics, among which were a silver urn, a gift from Lord Byron, and a set of ebony chairs presented by George IV. I saw the unfinished manuscript where Sir Walter laid down his pen.
