KARRI.\nDivision the case of the Jarrahdale Jarrah Forests Company and the Jarrah Wood and Saw Mills Company, Limited, v. Temperley and Co., came before Mr. Justices Wills and Charles in the Queen's Bench Divisional Court. This was an appeal from an order for an injunction to restrain the defendants from printing or publishing certain documents. It appeared that when the plaintiff company were on the point of going to trial, giving judgment, said that this was an application in one of those cases in which the Court was asked for preventing the circulation of a document which was undoubtedly calculated to do a great deal of mischief to the plaintiff company, and which was uncised. The defendants had published a certain statement that the jarrah wood of the plaintiffs had have been proved inferior to the karri wood sold at the King's Road, Chelsea, by Messrs. C. Temperley and Walsh, sole agent for the Karri Wood Paving Company. Any ordinary person reading that would naturally suppose that some comparison had been drawn was that there had been some judicial decision between the two woods, and that was the meaning of the statement; very likely it was not intended, but a statement made by the defendants was the cause of action. But a statement had been made by the defendants on the ground that something had been said in Court cannot be a ground of justification for such a statement. It turns out that the comparison made was between the wood at Chelsea and some wood from Jarrahwood. The defendants had had their attention called to this matter by the plaintiffs' solicitors as many as three timesâon the 25th of April, and the 4th, and 6th of Mayâand they had paid no attention to the fact that they had been told that what they got was that the defendants had no real intention to defend an action, and that under the circumstances the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction than bring the action to trial. Under these circumstances they were not entitled to the costs. With regard to the letter of the 8th May, which was written by the defendants' solicitor said he could not see that the defendants were not in the right in what they had done. The defendants had had every opportunity offered them, upon erroneous information, and that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the costs of the motion, and take the order for an injunction and the costs of the action, with costs. Judgment accordingly.",
