KARRI.—In the Queen's Bench Division the case of the Rockingham Jarrahdale Company and the Jarrahdale Timber Company, Limited, v. Temperley & Co., has been before Justices Wills and Charles, sitting as a Divisional Court. This was an application for an injunction to restrain the defendants from publishing certain disparaging matter affecting the plaintiff companies. Mr. Justice Wills, in giving judgment, said: In my opinion this is one of those cases in which the jurisdiction of preventing the circulation of a trade libel, which undoubtedly is calculated to be very mischievous to the plaintiffs, ought to be exercised. The defendants had published the statement that the jarrahwood, which seems to have been proved inferior to the karriwood in the King's Road, Chelsea, was supplied by Mr. Walsh, sole agent for the Jarrahdale Jarrah Company. Any one reading that would naturally suppose that the inference to be drawn was that there was some connection between the two woods. The defendants made the statement very likely they were misled by a statement made by Mr. Croyle in another action. But a statement made on the ground that some one else had made it cannot be a ground of defence to this action. It turns out that they were entirely wrong.\n\n621\nMANUFACTURERS OF THE\nRegistered RED TANG\nFILES.\nGAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nASHBY BROTHERS.—On Thursday Mr. Wace applied for the approval of a scheme of arrangement, under which a composition of 15s. in the pound is to be paid to the creditors by instalments within eighteen months from the date of approval, certain of the creditors consenting to postpone their claims. The debtors were builders and contractors, of Union Court, Old Broad Street, and Goulston Street, Whitechapel, and they filed their petition in February last, returning their joint liabilities at £8,407, with estimated assets £6,909, but the Official Receiver, having regard to the fact that the realisation of the estate would be of a hazardous character, reported in favour of the scheme, and his Honour made the desired order.\nBURBAGE, HENRY ALFRED, builder, Fishery Wharf, Boxmore.—This trader has executed a deed of arrangement. The following are creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nColes Shadbolt & Co., London ... 17 0 0\nCrowley S. W. & Co., Cambridge ... 30 0 0\nDolton, Bournes, & Dolton, London ... 34 0 0\nGordon Thomas, Bettws-y-Coed ... 35 0 0\nGoodman, Hughes, & Co., London ... 65 0 0\nHead & Co., Berkhamstead ... 20 0 0\nKey & Son, Berkhamstead ... 156 0 0\nKnight, Sons, & Co., London ... 18 0 0\nMarshall William, London ... 133 0 0\nNewell Francis, Southall ... 74 0 0\nStell Russell, Hemel Hempstead ... 16 0 0\nSturgess P.

(Charles Cheesman and Frank Cheesman), builders and contractors, 82, Queen's Road, and 47, Gloucester Road, Brighton.—Under this deed of arrangement stated the following are creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBarnard & Son, Brighton ... 13 0 0\nBotting William, Brighton ... 13 0 0\nBrown E. J., Brighton ... 78 0 0\nButt J. E. & Sons, Brighton ... 49 0 0\nChatfield & Sons, Lewes ... 36 0 0\nHall & Sons, London ... 14 0 0\nHart Bros., Brighton ... 10 0 0\nHayward Tyler, & Co., London ... 10 0 0\nNewington & Co., Brighton ... 19 0 0\nNicholls & Clark, London ... 41 0 0\nShapland & Petter, Barnstaple ... 18 0 0\nWells J., Brighton ... 20 0 0\nCOWPER, JOSEPH, builder, Holland Street, Brixton, and Brixton Road, S.W.—The receiving order in this case was made upon the petition of Messrs. A. & W. T. Richardson, of Vauxhall, and a sitting for the bankrupt's public examination was held on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The accounts showed unsecured debts £709 6s. 2d., and a debt fully secured £105 13s., the assets being estimated at £239 18s. 9d., after deducting £42 13s. for preferential payments. It appeared that the bankrupt commenced business in August, 1889, without capital, and that for about three months, until February, 1890, he traded in partnership with another person. He stated that his insolvency was attributable to losses and liabilities incurred in respect of contracts undertaken by him in June and October last, to strikes in the building trade, and to ill-health. The examination was concluded.\nEDWARDS, E. J., builder, Trumpington Street, Forest Gate, E.—The bankrupt attended for his public examination on Thursday before Mr. Registrar Hope. He commenced business in 1888 with about £150 capital, and has since, by means of advances secured on the properties, carried on speculative building operations at Forest Gate, Southgate, Acton, and Wimbledon. The statement of affairs showed unsecured debts £2,014 13s. 7d., and debts fully secured £6,916 15s. 11d., with no available assets. Mr. Brougham attended as Official Receiver. The examination was concluded.\nFERGUSON, DANIEL, builder, Bayswater, W.—The liabilities amount to £27,804, of which £3,336 is due to unsecured creditors. The assets are estimated to realise £2,247. The debtor formerly carried on business as a slate, lime, and cement merchant, at Paddington. In 1889 he was adjudicated bankrupt, and as soon as he obtained his order of discharge he started in business as a builder at Hereford Mansions, Hereford Road, Bayswater, where he had carried on business down to the date of the receiving order. The debtor alleges his present failure to have been caused through want of capital and inability to realise property, heavy interest, and commission in connection with advances, and to damages and costs incurred in respect of an air and light action.\nGARMAN, A. & W., builders, Frankton Road, Peckham, S.E.—The debtors have filed their petition, and upon the application of Messrs. Ward, Perks, & McKay a receiving order was made on Friday by Mr. Registrar Hope. The debtors state that their landlord has taken everything under a distress for rent, and is now in possession of the premises. They had been doing work in Milk Street, E.C., under a building agreement, but were in default. They had a plant, &c., of the value of about £30, the book debts being of doubtful value. The amount of the liabilities was not stated.\nGROVER & GROVER, timber merchants, Kentish Town Wharf, N.W.—This case has been already reported, and at an adjourned sitting held on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Hope, the bankrupts were allowed to pass their examination. The statement of affairs disclosed gross liabilities to the amount of £47,067, of which £15,797 are expected to rank, and an estimated surplus in assets of £9,405.\nHOCKING, WM. JOHN PRICE, builder, Station Road, Strood, late of Sydenham and Cuxton Road, Strood.—The debtor appeared at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday week. The gross liabilities were set down at £3,229, of which £1,687 was expected to rank, and the deficiency was £1,483. Messrs. HOCART & Robinson, timber merchants, are creditors for about £1,190, and another creditor Mr. Goodenough, timber merchant, who attended the examination, and questioned the debtor at some length with reference to the removal of certain plant. The debtor stated that he commenced business about twenty years ago with a capital of £50. He attributed his failure to losses on contracts at Woolwich, and in connection with the Manchester Ship Canal. The examination was adjourned.\nHORNE, ARTHUR, builder, Surrey Street, Strand, W.C.—This case has been previously reported in the Timber Trades Journal, and the debtor attended for his public examination last week before Mr. Registrar Hope. He returned his gross liabilities at £61,622 12s. 10d., of which £51,727 4s. 5d. are stated to be fully secured, and £9,895 8s. 5d. expected to rank, and the accounts show an estimated surplus, subject to realisation, of £371 7s. 2d. The debtor attributed his failure to the non-completion of a proposal by a land company to purchase his Surrey Street property, owing to the collapse of the Liberator and kindred companies. His examination was ordered to be concluded.\nJOHNSON, WILLIAM, builder, John Street, Bradford.—A meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held on Monday, when a statement of his affairs was laid before those concerned. The debtor attributed his position to heavy losses on a contract near Blackpool, and had no offer to make. An assignment for benefit of creditors was agreed to under the inspection of Mr. Judson, Mr. Guy, and Mr. Croft. Those most interested in the trade were:—\n£ s. d.\nBeecroft & Wightman, Bradford ... 20 15 2\nCurwen & Co., Fleetwood ... 38 13 10\nHarrison & Singleton, Bradford ... 512 7 1\nTealby & Co., Hull ... 64 7 11\nLEARMOUH, WM., builder, Emsworth Road, Portsmouth.—This bankrupt attended at the Portsmouth Bankruptcy Court on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Renny, for his public examination. Mr. Wm. F. J. Hunt, Assistant Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, Mr. E. J. Bechérvaise the trustee, and (Mr. G. Tayler) the debtor. The debtor had filed his accounts as ordered, and after a brief examination was closed.\nMEECH, H. H., shop window fitter, 65, Wood Street, E.C.—An adjourned meeting of creditors was held in this case last week, before Mr. L. Hough, Official Receiver, for the purpose of considering a scheme of composition. The Chairman said that at the previous meeting an offer of 10s. in the pound was before the creditors, but it was now raised to 12s. 6d. in the pound, payable as to 10s. within twenty-one days, and the balance in three months. The offer was accepted, and Mr. J. W. Barratt, accountant, was appointed trustee to carry out the scheme.\nThe wood at Chelsea was not Jarrahwood. The defendants' attention called to this misstatement as many as three times—by letters of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th of March. The only answer attention to the fact that this was wholly without foundation. The answer they got was that the defendants meant to defend an action. Under these circumstances the plaintiffs could not do otherwise than bring the action. However, they were not entitled to suppose that, after the letter of the 8th March in which the defendants' solicitor said he had nothing to add, the defendants were not likely to give in in any way? The defendants had in my judgment acted upon erroneous information for which the plaintiffs are not responsible, and they must take the consequences. There must be an injunction and the defendants must pay the costs. Judgment was given for the plaintiffs with costs and the injunction claimed.",
