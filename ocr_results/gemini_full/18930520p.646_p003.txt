Mr. A. S. Cully, Assistant Receiver, presided at the adjourned meeting last Wednesday of the creditors and shareholders in this business being wound up under a compulsory order of the Court.
A committee of inspection was appointed, consisting of Messrs. Stoneham, Moore, and Mr. Sidney James, to conduct the winding-up on behalf of creditors.
The company was floated in May, 1887, with a capital of £25,000, of which £1,080 was privately subscribed, and £14,780 was issued in fully paid shares as the purchase price of the business.
In April, 1891, the works and stock were destroyed by fire, to which cause the failure of the company is ascribed.
The debts are returned at £3,203 10s. 10d.; the assets are valued at £18,176 13s. 8d., and there is a deficiency of £10,107 7s. 2d. as regards contributories.
The Chairman having explained the business of the meeting, Mr. Richard J. Hodges (Y. J. Ward & Co.) proposed that Mr. Percy Holman (Holman & Fox, croft), accountant, 11, Queen Victoria Street, E.C., should be recommended to the Court for the post of liquidator.
The resolution was seconded by Mr. Prosper Ahohbot, and was carried unanimously.
The creditors were elected to assist the liquidator in the administration, viz., Mr. R. J. Hodges, and Mr. J. E. Earl.

He had, he said, traded with his son's capital for the last seven years.
The examination was concluded.

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. MAY 20, 1893.

HOBBS, JAMES, builder, Weymouth.
This bankrupt attended at the Dorchester County Court on Friday for his public examination.
The liabilities were £975 17s. 6d., and tassets £130 4s.
The deficiency was attributed to losses on contracts.

He failed since then, and upon restarting he only did contract work.
His old creditors received 7s. 6d. in the pound, and he was assisted by his father-in-law, who was also a builder.
He had lost money over the contracts.
He had also guarantee at [?].
He lost money over the contracts on one for £1,000 he lost £450.

Messrs Edell & Gordon represented the petitioning creditors.
In the course of the proceedings the debtor stated that he commenced business in January, 1892, with a capital of £200.
In October and November last he had goods to the amount of £389 from the North Germano Pinewood Company, Limited, and he sold them all at a loss.
He believed that they realised about £200 or £300.
Being asked why he sold the goods at so low a price, the debtor said he was charged too much for them, and after the first delivery he wrote making a claim upon the company.
With reference to the claim of Mr. Edwards, of Birmingham, he had borrowed £500 from him, and repaid him £300 or £400 on account of principal and interest, the sum of £437 representing the balance of the claim.
He had had dealings with Messrs. Dolton, Bournes, & Dolton sold their goods under cost price.
The prices of firewood had fallen last year, and he considered that he had been charged too much.
He had been obliged to do a large trade.
The Chairman: Not much good doing a large trade when you sold at the prices you did.
You have succeeded in running up a large amount of indebtedness in a very short period.
The debtor said that he was unable to make any proposal, and his affairs will be wound up in bankruptcy, the Official Receiver acting as trustee.

It appeared that the debtor commenced business originally in 1868, with £600 capital, and in 1881, when trading at Brockley, he became involved in difficulties in connection with building operations at Catford and Grove Park, and his property was realised, with the result that a dividend of 6s. 8d. in the £ was paid on liabilities amounting to £13,000.
In October, 1891, he undertook the erection of thirty-four houses in Rosedale Road, Streatham, and the troubles in connection with his present failure arose in connection with the manufacture of bricks and his building operations at Streatham.
The Official Receiver observed that there were circumstances in the case which would require strict investigation, particularly with reference to charges which had been given upon his property.
It was stated that, so far as the debtor's assets were concerned, he was a prisoner for debt, and it was concerned, she was a prisoner for debt, and it was likely to lose any chance of recovering the money.

and Mr. J. E. Earl, who was represented by the telephone.

TRACY, F., builder, 12, Southbrook Road, Lee.
The debtor appeared for his public examination on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Pitt-Taylor.
The liabilities were £1,000, and the assets £200.
The debtor attributed his failure to want of capital, and to his building operations at Southbrook Road, Lee, where he had erected four blocks of houses, which are still unfinished, but in which his interest is the subject of litigation.
The mortgagee has taken possession, and the debtor has also stated that he has a claim against him with a certain firm.
The debtor stated that as his building progressed he had erected houses in Southampton Row, Bloomsbury, but in consequence of executions put in by creditors, the above-mentioned firm induced him to remove his office, that, as he had made several large advances, the work on the houses in question took possession of them.
The bankrupt states that he has commenced an action against this firm for illegal possession.
In reply to the bankrupt's statements the meeting of creditors was held on Feb. 23rd, when a composition of 7s. in the £ was offered and refused.
The bankrupt states that he is not insolvent, and his assets show an apparent surplus.
He attributes his present position to the delay in getting his case into the High Court, and to delay in finishing the Southampton Row buildings, which had been stopped by the freeholder; also to the loss sustained by the mortgagees in possession of the houses, and to loss by the alleged illegal possession of the Southampton Row property.
It should be noted, however, that the debtor's estimated surplus is arrived at by taking the whole of his property at cost price.
Mr. F. C. Willis appeared on behalf of Mr. Foote for the bankrupt, and Mr. Wreford, attending as Official Receiver, the bankrupt was examined as to his affairs, and stated that his accounts required some time in setting out the actual position of his affairs, and that he was unable to give any further information respecting his affairs until his books had been written up.

The bankrupt agreed to allow to remain as a debt to his wife's estate the sum of £1,000, which he had received from her, and he had also given her security for the amount.
The bankrupt stated that he had not made any profit out of his building operations.
He attributed his failure to depreciation in the value of his property, and to his having to pay a high rate of interest for money advanced.
The bankrupt's books had been kept by his wife, and she had also drawn cheques on his account, and he had not seen the pass-book for some time.
