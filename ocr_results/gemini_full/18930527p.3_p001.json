The trade was sparsely represented and the country buyers were exceedingly few. The home wood trade was, however, largely present. The situation of the trade is unaltered, and reports are all of one nature, that business proceeds in a most routine fashion. One further stoppage is reported in the west, but on the only port interested to any extent, ousebuilding trade keeps its good custom, and orders from this department are satisfactory. The following representatives of the trade were present, viz. :—\nMessrs. Roger (Garland & Roger), Leith\nBuchanan (R. Melville & Co.), Grahamstone\nMarshall (J. Denholm & Co.), Bo'ness\nPeters (M.

Built from plans by Mr. A. B. M'Donald, the city engineer, the barracks have a front elevation to the Clyde, are four stories in height, cover about 20 square yards, and are estimated to cost about £10,000. Accommodation has been provided for the housing of eighty unmarried constables. The barracks have been erected in the central district of the city.\n\nPERTH.—Messrs. Henderson & Shaw have just completed the erection of a substantial and roomy drying shed at their Victoria street saw-mills, Perth. This addition is on the latest and most approved principles, and will provide for the firm's stock of suitable hardwoods and pine. The dimensions are about 90 ft. by 20 ft., with two floors, and will accommodate a very large stock of cut wood. The new saw-mill for Messrs. Fleming & Barry is in process of erection at their Perth yard, and will soon be in active operation. It is hoped for the sake of the trade that this additional mill will not exercise an has once been hinted, a reduction of prices which, on saw-milling effects in Scotland.\n\nThe Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\n\nGAZETTE.\n\nPOLLOCK, JOHN, Cabinet Works, Beith.—The following are creditors herein :—\n... £ s. d.\nAgnew R.

Williamson, secretary and treasurer of the Williamson & Libbey Lumber Company, Oshkosh, Wis. Mr. Williamson was born near Melrose, Scotland, in 1830, but when three years old came to America with his father, Robert Williamson. The family settled in Schenectady, N.Y. When fifteen years old George M. left his father and learned the carpenter's trade, at which he worked until 1854, the time when the gold fever was stimulating the adventurous spirits of the country to seek their fortunes in California. Mr. Williamson spent two years in the gold fields with moderate success, and when he returned to the States he settled in Oshkosh, in 1856. He pursued his trade of carpenter for some years, but in 1866, in company with G. C. Griffith and N. Conrad, he purchased a sash, door, and blind factory. In 1869 Mr. Conrad's interest in the business was sold to J. S. Cameron, the firm name becoming the following year Williamson & Company. In 1875, during the great fires which afflicted the north, and in which Oshkosh was a heavy sufferer, their mill was totally destroyed, but immediately rebuilt on a much larger scale. In March, 1879, Daniel L. Libbey became a member of the firm which was reorganised into a stock company, the present organisation being incorporated. — The First Chicago Timberman.\n\nIMPORTS.\n\nALLOA.\nMay 16 Ida—Gothenburg—54,380 props and sleepers—Order\nMay 17 Frede Brodre—Arendal—10,903 pit props—Alloa Coal Co.\nMay 19 Victoria—Konigsberg—7,074 pit props—Madsen & Borch\nMay 20 Drag—140 lds. pit props—Kirkwood & Co.\nMay 22 Almas—Konigsberg—150 lds. pit props—Ensign & Macleod\n\nAYR.\nMay 19 Architect—Halmstad—543 lds. pit props—Love & Stewart\nMay 20 Emblem—Hommelvik—411 lds. sawn fir battens—W.
