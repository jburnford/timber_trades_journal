Two hundred lots of cut timber, consisting of beech, ash, elm planking, and spokes, felloes, and naves, were exposed for sale. Ash planking 1 in. thick brought from 2d. to 3½d. per foot, beech from 2d. to 3d., and larch about 2d. per foot. Spokes realised 6s. 6d. per gang and felloes 11s. per gang of 12. Cart lorry wood yielded prices slightly below those of former years. A quantity of beech averaged about 1s. 8d. per cubic foot. Large ash fetched about 1s. 10d., though two truckloads of logs brought 2s. 3d. per foot. Four trucks of elm realised 1s. 4d., and Scotch fir large timber 11d. per foot. Larch yielded 1s. 4d. to 1s. 8d. per cubic foot. Mr. John M'Intyre acted as auctioneer.\n\nHENRY EDWARDS,\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\n212, CANONGATE, EDINBURGH.\nMahogany, Walnut, Wainscot, Oak, Ash, Birch, &c., in Planks, Boards, & Veneers.\n\nMAY 27, 1893\nGOEHRING'S WOOD MOULDINGS.\nAT the Gardening and Forestry Exhibition, Earl's Court, London, the exhibit of Messrs. J. M. Bennett & Sons, of Hyde-road, Manchester, and South Wharf, Paddington, E.C., will attract considerable attention. This exhibit consists of what is known as \"Goehring,\" or machine-made carved wood mouldings, both for architectural, decorative, and picture-frame purposes, invented by a citizen of Leipsic, a non-medical graduate of one of the Leipsic hospitals, named Goehring. It is claimed in the name of the process that any kind of wood is so highly compressed by means of the machinery that it can be perfectly polished without the intervention of sandpapering, and this is demonstrated by the show at Earls Court, where every description of sanitary ware is shown. The application of the process to the softer sort would be immediately apparent. It is not claimed that the process will supersede hand-work, or is intended to do so, but that it can be used to relieve the monotony of plain surfaces. It is perfectly legitimate to claim for it that Goehring can be just as readily applied to the softest to the hardest woods, and that teak and sabicu, as well as the softer woods, can be obtained in any pattern, and can be used wherever desired. It is a distinct description of the process that is claimed, and that Messrs. J. M. Bennett & Sons, the whole of the patents for the United Kingdom, and that all the wood is treated at their extensive mills at Ardwick, Manchester.\nThis handsome and effective exhibit has been designed and carried out by Messrs. J. M. Bennett & Sons, in conjunction with Goodall & Co., of Manchester, the well-known decorators, King-street, Manchester, for the purpose of illustrating the many uses and adaptations of this new treatment of mouldings for decorative purposes. It is a distinctly new departure, and will thus to find province for itself, and will not [?] has hitherto been the province of the [?] but will find themselves side by side in friendly competition with the sister art of carving. The feeling in the trade is that it is a distinctly of an artistic character. The oak work is particularly good, as well some of the panels.\n\nBROWNLEE & CO., LD.\n\nDUNN & CO.\nLarge Stocks of Wainscot Flooring, Greenheart, &c.\n\nA. B. LUNDGREN,\nOVE LANGE,\nLinoleum Poles.
