Ross & Co. report that operations in timber have not decreased in volume, nor have prices suffered to any great extent. From the country as was usual comes the greater demand, which was augmented to some extent by the fact that buyers were induced to purchase in advance of their ordinary requirements before the Easter holidays, in order to secure rail freight at the old rates, which have been increased. Of the leading lines most attention has been devoted to floorings, and there has been some disposition to speculate in deals and battens at a concession. In Oregon sales have been light, and other lines have merely been operated upon to meet bare requirements. At the auctions held on the 21st ult. a good business was done in t. & g. and weatherboards, but, although excellent assortments of sugar and Oregon pine were submitted, only a few unimportant sales were effected of the latter. With the exception of a small line of shelving no other business of material note was transacted. Outside of this particular class there has not, however, been shown any desire to purchase for other than immediate wants, and consequently sales of Oregon, Baltic, and spruce deals, &c., have been of an unimportant character, although we have been informed at the last moment of a large clearance of Baltic deals, which we have not yet been able to verify. The temporary stoppage of two of our largest banking institutions, and which are now under reconstruction, has slightly interfered with timber dealings, and must be prejudicial to the business generally, until these banks have resumed operations. Lumber.—Imports: Clear pine, nil; white pine shelving, 16,826 ft. super.; t. & g. ceiling, nil. Arrival:—Thomas Stephens, from New York. Very little business has been effected. Asking rates for Canadian clear pine are not procurable. Shelving and ceiling are slow of sale. Kauri pine.—Imports: 210,000 ft. super. Arrivals.—Chittoor, from Kaipara; Tarawera (s), from Auckland, from which business has been done privately, and continues very dull.\n\nMR. SAMUEL R. WALTER reports the improved demand for Baltic and Oregon timber noted last month has since continued, and, on the whole, a better business has been carried through than for many months past. The demand, however, is almost entirely confined to the country districts. There is no change to report respecting the town trade, which is still very dull, and is likely to continue so during the coming winter. Late advices of the advance in the values of wood in the London market, and the steady increase of our various natural products, will prove important factors in the return to prosperity so much desired by us all. Norwegian and Scotch flooring.—Imports: 4,312,967 ft. lineal. Sales at auction aggregate 1,067,778 ft. lineal, realising—for red 6x2 t. & g., 6s.; shorts, 4s. 6d.; 6x¾ beaded, 4s.; shorts, 3s.; 4-out weatherboards 1s. 11d.; shorts, one-fourth less; white 6x1¼ t. & g., 6s. 9d.; 6x⅞, 5s. 3d.; shorts, 4s. 6d.; 6x¾ beaded, 3s. 9d.; shorts, 3s.; 4-out weatherboards, 4s. 8d.; shorts, 3s. 6d. per 100 ft. lineal. During the month the cargo ex Glencairn, from Fredrikstad, which was sold to a firm in the trade to arrive, was mostly resold on arrival at the ship's side, very little going into purchaser's yards. Considerable sales have also been made privately of old stocks, and other sales are pending, p.n.t. The bulk of the sales during the month have been for up-country requirements, the local dealers holding sufficient stocks for some time to come.\nMESSRS. GEMMELL, TUCKETT, & Co. report the country merchants have been purchasing rather freely, in anticipation of an advance in railway freights, which has since been confirmed by the Commissioners. At the auction sales, held on the 21st ult., there was a good attendance of the trade, and a fair amount of business was done in flooring. The balance of the cargo ex Drumlanrig was offered, and a clearance of most of the lines made. The remainder of the flooring submitted was withdrawn, as were also the Baltic red deals, spruce deals, Oregon (new stocks), clear pine, sugar pine, shelving, and ceiling, the bidding not reaching holders' limits. Of the other lines catalogued the only sales effected were Oregon (old stock), Oregon laths, Californian clear redwood, clear spruce shelving, undressed, in trade parcels, at prices quoted in our list of sales by auction. Baltic red deals. —Imports: nil. On the 21st ult. parcels ex Cleomene, Heinrich, and Crown of Scotland, offered at auction, were withdrawn, there being no demand. We quote—5½d. for 11x3 mixed to 4d. for 7x2½ 3rds. Baltic white deals.—Imports: nil. Sales, nil. Prices nominal. Canadian timber.—Imports: nil. Parcels of 9x3 and 8x3 spruce and 1, 1¼, 2 in. clear pine were offered at auction on the 21st ult. without leading to business. Vendors quote for clear pine, £12 per 1,000 ft. super.; spruce deals, 3d. per foot 9x3.\nMESSRS. FRASER & CO., LIM., report a decided improvement in the demand for certain kinds of timber has been shown, but no rates have been paid in advance of those lately ruling except for Baltic weatherboards. The bulk of business is still done with the country districts, and the improved demand is partly due to it having been notified that railway freights would be increased from the beginning of the present month; country buyers naturally being anxious to stock a larger quantity than of late before the higher rates of carriage came into existence. A fair amount of business was concluded at auction on the 21st ult., principally in flooring, lining, and weatherboards, and since then, both in old and new stocks of this description of timber, a good demand has generally been experienced.\n\nREVIEW.\nNewspaper Press Directory. London: C. Mitchell & Co., 1893.\nThis is the forty-eighth annual edition of a most valuable index to all the newspapers, magazines, and periodicals in the United Kingdom. It is extremely valuable as a work of reference. Its utility is enhanced by the directories of the Press of Australasia, South Africa, and India, as well as of foreign countries. It will interest our readers to know that there are 459 newspapers published in London and 1,762 in the provinces. A special feature of the Directory is the concise and well-written article on the growth and progress of Australasian trade. The particulars relating to the countries of the world are also not without their interest to commercial men and the general public.\n\nF. W. REYNOLDS & CO.'S NEW CATALOGUE.\nThe Acorn Works in Edward Street, Blackfriars Road, London, S.E., have long been noted for the excellence of their productions, the variety of which can be seen and appreciated by a copy of what we refer to. Messrs. F. W. Reynolds & Co. Generally speaking, the price lists and trade catalogues issued by firms in this country; but a great improvement has been noticeable of late on this side of the Atlantic, and evidence of this is presented in the catalogue to which we now direct our readers' attention. Quite recently we have seen some American productions of unusual attractiveness in terms of the highest praise—terms which might well be bestowed on the latest list issued from the Acorn Works. The catalogue is well and strongly bound, being subordinated to serviceability, while each of the 120 pages of which it consists is splendidly illustrated and capitally printed. The general arrangement, too, is good, and the list of code words will be especially useful to saw-mill owners and builders' and contractors abroad. Among the machines here illustrated and described are many of the indispensable features of every wood workers' plant, including band saw machines, deal frames, fretsaw machines, grinding machines, log frames, mortising machines, planing and jointing machines, rack benches, sandpapering machines, living-up machines, &c. Messrs. F. W. Reynolds & Co. make a speciality of machinery for builders and contractors, and among their productions mention may be made of mortar and paint mills, pumps, turbines, venetian blind machines, lathes, fans, engines, and pulley blocks. These are all fully described in the new catalogue, which also contains particulars of their hire-purchase system as applied to builders' and contractors' machinery for the home trade.\nSaw-mill owners and others interested in the most improved types of wood-working machinery will find Messrs. Reynolds & Co.'s new work of considerable value, as illustrating the best types and most skilful designs calculated to promote the prosperity of one of the most essential industries of the country.\n\nSPANISH EXCHANGE.\nThe following rates of exchange on May 23rd are supplied by Messrs. Utne & Ekman:—\nBARCELONA—London, at 90 days, pesetas 29 20.\nDitto, at sight, pesetas 29 65.\nMADRID—London, at sight, 17.25 per cent.\nParis, at 8 days, 16.85 per cent.",
