The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £2,855 12s. 2d., but proofs have been made by creditors to sums amounting in the aggregate to £4,692 5s. 3d., including a proof for £2,272 in respect of damages for breach of contract. The assets have realised £161 5s. 6d., and a further sum may be received in respect of plant and materials. In 1881, having for some years previously been in partnership at Bow, bankrupt commenced business alone with about £1,000 capital at 13, Lucas Road, Stratford, where he traded down to the date of the receiving order. He attributed his failure to a loss, amounting to over £2,000, in respect of a contract entered into by him in August, 1891, for the erection of blocks of buildings known as the Victoria Dwellings, in South Lambeth Road, to which his unsecured liabilities principally relate. The Official Receiver reported as offences that the assets were not equal to 10s. in the pound on the amount of the unsecured liabilities, and that the bankrupt had omitted to keep proper books of account. His Honour granted the discharge, subject to a suspension of two years, or by the Act.\nFINNEY, ALBERT, joiner and builder, Milton.-At Hanley, on Thursday week, this bankrupt appeared for his public examination upon a statement of affairs showing liabilities of £362 19s. 9d., and assets £331 4s. 7d. Replying to Mr. T. Bullock he stated that he commenced business eighteen years ago with a small capital. He had not carried on business long before he was compelled to file his petition, but he did not remember the amount of his liabilities nor what the creditors got. For several years after that he worked as a journeyman, and started again as a builder in 1890. He did not discover that he was insolvent until February, though he had no doubt that he was unable to pay 20s. in the pound twelve or eighteen months ago. The examination was adjourned for a month, the bankrupt being ordered to file a statement of receipts and payments from the 1st Jannary, 1892.\nHANNETT, STARKEY WILLIAM, cabinet-maker, Beatrice Road, Leicester, and Karborough Road, Leicester, under the style of Derby.-A meeting of the creditors interested herein was held on Monday, at the Official Receiver's offices, Leicester, under the presidency of Mr. Burgess, under the presi- dency of Mr. A. C. Palmer and Mr. J. H. Scott (Timber Trade Protection Association, Hull) represented the creditors. The debtor's statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £12,961 18s. 8d., of which £8,817 15s. 7d. was expected to rank against the estate for dividend. The assets were returned at £2,141 19s. 5d., thus leaving a deficiency of £6,675 6s. 2d. Eventually it was proposed by Mr. Kelham, and seconded by Mr. G. S. Hannett, that Mr. A. C. Palmer, chartered accountant, Leicester and London, and Mr. Scott, of the Timber Trades' Protection Association, be appointed trustees, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection consisting of the following creditors:-Mr. G. S. Hannett, Mr. T. Bailey, and Mr. T. J. Clarke.\nKING, CHARLES HENRY, coach-builder, Quarry Hill, Tonbridge, Kent.-The summary of the debtor's statement of affairs shows gross liabilities amounting to £342 16s. 7d., of which is expected to rank £302 11s. 5d., and assets estimated to produce £278 11s. 1d., deficiency £24 0s. 4d. The debtor alleges the cause of failure to be \"want of capital and inexperience.\" The Official Receiver's observations were:-The receiving order herein was made on the debtor's own petition by his father took over the business carried on in 1889. He has not kept a cash book, or a ledger, or ever gone into his affairs, and [?]",
