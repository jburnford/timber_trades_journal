DAVID CHRISTIE was fatally injured at Dundee Harbour. While repairing a large stalk at Camperdown Sawmills he observed the brickwork giving way, and he leaped to the ground from a height of twenty feet. In alighting the stalk fell above him, and he was buried amongst the ruins. He died a few minutes after being admitted to the Infirmary.

THE FATAL ACCIDENT AT THE EDINBURGH POST OFFICE.—In the Court of Session, Lord Kincairney has been informed of the settlement of an action in which Mrs. Gilhooly, 239, Cowgate, Edinburgh, widow of James Gilhooly, mason, sued Colin Macandrew, builder, Lauriston Gardens, for £500 damages for the death of her husband, who, on 29th June, 1892, while in the employment of the defender, at the building of an addition to the General Post Office fell from a plank leading to the scaffold and sustained fatal injuries. The pursuer sued for herself and also as administratrix for her five children, and has accepted £234 in full of her claims.

The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.
CAMPBELL & MUGGOCH, GLASGOW.
THE portraits we have the pleasure to re-produce are those of the two partners of the firm of Campbell & Muggoch, who have already laid the foundation of a business which gives every indication of assuming to itself the proportions of a prominent Glasgow timber concern. The business was only started in 1892, but the rapid and steady development has been noticeable by everyone since its initiation. In our annual issue, a few months ago, we gave an illustration of their new yard and a sketch of their increasing business. We congratulate them on their growing business, which in the hands of the present partners will continue to grow. Mr. Campbell, in the commercial department, enjoys a deserved popularity for his genial and happy disposition, and Mr. Muggoch, in the more practical department, is one whose thorough experience gives confidence to the customers in their selections of everyday requirements, and with this combination their connection will still further extend. The portrait on the top right hand corner is that of Mr. Campbell; that on the left of Mr. Muggoch.
