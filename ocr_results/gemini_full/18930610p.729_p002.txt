THE KIDDERPORE DOCKS, CALCUTTA.-The docks at Kidderpore, constructed at a cost of nearly three crores of rupees, are fitted with labour-saving devices for the loading and unloading of cargoes, with warehouses for receiving the same, and with all the adjuncts that modern practice can suggest, but they have done little or no business.-Indian Engineer.
THE Dublin Engineer reports that a timber wharf, 90 ft. in length, has been constructed in the Dodder at Ringsend Point, to afford accommodation to vessels discharging coal or other cargoes for Ringsend, Irishtown, and neighbouring parts of the Pembroke township, and the river in front has been dredged out to a depth of about 5 ft. at low water. The wharf east of the entrance to the Graving Dock has been extended 30 ft to the eastward, to accommodate the trade of Messrs. Goulding, making the total length of this wharf 186 ft.

AMERICAN LUMBER IN AUSTRALIA.
The United States Consul-General in Melbourne sends some interesting information in a recent letter to his Government about the use of American timber in Australia. Mr. Wallace says:-
"The large influx of population flowing into Australia since 1852 has developed an extra-ordinary demand for building material. As the timber indigenous to Australia is hardwood and not well adapted for building or joinery, its place was supplied by the importation of Swedish deals, flooring, clapboards, and square timber. At first the trade was entirely in the hands of English houses, but American firms soon entered into competition, bringing ready-made sash and doors and lumber of the usual sizes and grades from the eastern coast of the United States and Canada. The lumber was followed by pitch pine, which in its turn has had to give place to lumber from Puget Sound.
"What is known to the trade as 'Oregon' has become a standard building timber, and the demand for it will keep pace with whatever building or improvement is done in the colonies. This is shown by the importation into the colony of Victoria during the past seven years, the greatest period of building and improvement the colony has ever known. The importations of Oregon, which amounted in 1886 to 31,341,179 superficial feet, rose to 55,487,693 superficial feet in 1888, but has since declined to 12,000,000 superficial feet in 1892; and it is estimated that there are in importers' and trade hands about 3,000,000 superficial feet, which, with from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 feet afloat, will furnish a full supply for twelve months or more to come, as the normal consumption is not more than that amount per annum. It is the opinion of the trade generally that the demand for timber in the near future must be comparatively small, as it cannot well recover quickly from the severe blows dealt it by the collapse of building societies and the bursting of the land booms.
"The kinds of timber imported into the colony of Victoria from the western coast of America are Oregon, sugar pine, redwood, and spruce. Oregon is principally used for the rough and heavy work in building, bridge work, &c. In former years this timber arrived in good condition and was of good quality, but latterly complaints have been made under both counts, and more care should be taken in loading and stowing at the port of shipment. Sugar pine, which is used mainly in the manufacture of fittings, and for the better class of general joiners' work, is gradually growing more and more into favour with architects, to the detriment of Michigan clear pine, which has been used almost exclusively for this kind of work for many years. The average annual consumption for the past few years was about 2,000,000 superficial feet, but, for the same reason as Oregon has decreased, this average is far from being maintained at the present time. The stock on hand is about 1,500,000 superficial feet. Redwood supplies the wants of the cheaper class of cabinet work, fittings, &c. Of this timber the usual annual consumption is about one million two hundred thousand superficial feet, and the estimated stock on hand is about 1,000,000 feet. Spruce from Puget Sound is also imported; but the last was sold as Oregon. The supply can be obtained from St. John's of a better quality and at cheaper rates."
A NEW TOURIST STEAMER FOR NORWAY.-A new steamer, the Venus, constructed by Messrs. C. S. Swan & Hunter, of Wallsend, is made on the spar-deck type, and is rigged as a topsail schooner. All the state rooms are on the main and there are not more than two berths in each. The engines supplied on the improved triple-expansion system, by the Wallsend Slipway and Engineering Company, are so powerful that this vessel-the Venus-is expected to be the swiftest in the Norwegian service.
