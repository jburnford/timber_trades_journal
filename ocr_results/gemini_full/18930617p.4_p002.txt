The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.
LEITH WEEKLY SALE.
The company assembled on Tuesday under the most pleasant conditions as regards the weather; the attendance was large and considerably above the average. The presiding firm, Garland & Roger, had a number of new cargoes to offer from the quay. The broker, Mr. D. W. Hardie, had, however, difficulty in concentrating that amount of attention that leads to animated business; there being considerable apathy shown, indicating that the acquirements were limited. At first he was obliged to pass over a number of the lots owing to the biddings falling short of his limits. The sellers were firm as to prices. Ultimately, however, as the time proceeded the biddings become more free, resulting in business; but at no time were the proceedings characterised by briskness, the prospects and condition of general trade evidently forbidding buyers to speculate more than actual current wants necessitate. With the good company and a little to each, must have totalled up to a fair amount. Nothing at present is occurring to cause special comment, and no subject of general interest cropped up in the conversation. The importers were all represented, and amongst the company we noticed:—
Mr. Robert Wallace (Wm. Fergus & Co.), Leith.
„ A. Paterson, Haddington.
„ Drysdale (Drysdale & Gilmour), Leith.
„ Sounness (J. & A. Sounness), Edinburgh.
„ John Brown (M. & J. Brown), Edinburgh.

GLASGOW TIMBER MARKET.
A small attendance marked the meeting this week. Nothing of an interesting nature is occurring to concentrate discussion on any particular subject. The feeling is cheerful enough, although current business is not up to the standard of activity that is desirable. Hope of improvement with the advancing season has a firm hold on the trade.
The Glasgow Wednesday market does not seem to occupy the same position of importance to the Glasgow timber trade. Their representatives do not muster so largely or so regularly as was the custom of some years. A decided falling away has been marked during the last year or two. The outport firms, however, put in a very regular appearance. The buyers from inland towns are, however, not so numerous or so punctual as they used to be, thus minimising the business to be done. On Wednesday we noticed the following, viz.:—
Mr. A. Thomson (Bell & Sime), Dundee.
„ J. Masterton (M. Thomson & Co.), Granton.
„ G. Muirhead (Muirhead & Son), Grangemouth.
„ W. Kerr (Garland & Roger), Leith.
„ J. McLauchlan (J. McLean & Co.), Greenock.
„ J. Martin (J. T. Salvesen & Co.), Grangemouth.
„ J. Cupples (P. & J. Wilkie), Grangemouth.
„ Williamson, Grangemouth.
„ J. Clark, Grahamston.
„ J. Baird (J. Baird & Co.), Grahamston.
„ R. Buchanan (R. Melville & Co.), Grahamston.
„ Fairly (McPherson and McLaren), Grangemouth.
„ Douglas (Fleming & Barry), Dundee.
„ Peters (M. Thomson & Co.), Granton.
From inland towns were:—
Mr. J. Armstrong, Dumfries.
„ G. Morgan, Crieff.
„ J. McAinsh, Crieff.
„ D. C. Wright, Dunblane.
„ F. Morgan, Crieff.
„ T. Thomson, Wishaw.
„ W. Dick, Hamilton.
„ P. Wilson & Son, Auchinleck.
„ W. Adam, Blantyre.
„ &c., &c., &c.
