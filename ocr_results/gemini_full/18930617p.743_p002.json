C. R. Lilley for the relief of the poor persons who were compelled to leave their homes by the fire at Mr. Forman's timber yard has reached over £340, and it is hoped to raise sufficient to recoup the sufferers for all they have lost.\nHATCHAM. — Between the hours of twelve and one on Monday night a fire broke out at the Hatcham Saw-mills and Wood Packing Case Works belonging to Box and H. Glover & Co. At the time the firm had a night shift of sawyers at work upon some pressing orders. The men had left off work, passed through the night watchman and were at dinner, and the night watchman had about ten minutes previous to the alarm being given. Although two hydrants and a plentiful supply of fire buckets and fire extinguishers were at hand the men were unable to check the fire, which obtained thorough hold of the room in which it first broke out. Several fire engines were quickly upon the scene, and the fire was extinguished at about two a.m., having been limited to the room in which it broke out. The greater portion of the premises are uninjured, owing to the exceptionally strong fireproof construction of the buildings, divided into compartments, separated by iron doors. The premises are said to be insured in the North British and Mercantile Offices. The cause of the fire is unknown, but is believed to have been the act of an incendiary, as it was first seen at a point adjoining the road, and because during the fire a burglary was committed; the time-keeper's office being broken into, his desk forced open, and a sum of money stolen therefrom. The building damaged was used as a box and packing case shop, situate above a portion of the saw-mills. The machinery in the room below was only partially damaged by water. We understand that this fire, although it will incommode Messrs. C. H. Glover & Co. to some extent, will not cause any material interruption to their business, and that work will be immediately resumed in other parts of the mills as usual\nLONDON COUNTY COUNCIL AND THE TIMBER TRADE.\nYARDS.—A meeting of saw-mill proprietors, timber merchants, and other trades interested in the storage of timber, will be held at Botolph House, Eastcheap, E.C., under the auspices of the Timber Trade Section of the London Chamber of Commerce, on Tuesday next, at 2.30 p.m., with the object of considering and deciding upon the action to be taken in view of certain amendments which have been suggested by the Building Act Committee of the London County Council in the London Building Law Consolidation Bill. As they affect the interests of all proprietors of saw-mills, as well as of timber merchants and others, it is felt that objections should be formulated, and steps taken to procure such modifications as may be fair and reasonable. All firms interested in the subject are invited to attend the meeting.\n\nJUNE 17, 1893.\nREVIEWS.\nThe Law of Private Trading Partnership. By James Walter Smith. London: Effingham Wilson & Co., 1893.\nThis book was first written in 1859, but since then legislation has rendered several editions necessary, and it now appears in Wilson's Series of Legal Handy Books in a very different form. It embraces the whole law on the subject of partnership, and will be of considerable interest and value to commercial men generally. It deals with the acts of partners, their interest and liabilities, how one partner binds another, of the duties of partners, and on the closing scene of all, the dissolution of a partnership. We commend the work to our readers.\nFrench and English Technical Terms. By J. J. Fletcher. London: Crosby Lockwood & Co., 1893.\nTechnological dictionaries are valuable works of reference to all classes of the community, and their usual bulky character renders them satisfactory when required away from home. We fancy that many engineers, architects, surveyors, and others, will thank Mr. Fletcher for having prepared a glossary of technical terms, which can be carried in the waistcoat pocket, and which is so comprehensive as to embrace all ordinary technical terms in both languages, as well as tables relating to the strength of iron, and many ready calculations for everyday reference.\n\"PAINTERS AND PICTURES,\" which has just been published by George Newnes, Ltd., contains a reproduction of Mr. B. W. Leader's famous picture \"Carting Timber,\" a delightful rural scene.\nHAMBURG DOCKS.—These docks are the property of the State of Hamburg. They are managed daily by a permanent staff of 1,500 workmen, while on the average 300 are employed, with 6,347 yds. of quayage. The total length of the sheds is 8,831 yds., with 6,347 yds. of covered area of 168,082 square yards. There are 215 steam and 120 hand cranes, and a total length of 67 miles of railway on the quays is about to be accommodated. These figures exclude the portion of the harbour leased to the Hamburg-American Company. Eighty to 100 average vessels can be accommodated.\nTIMBER FOR THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL.—The London County Council on Tuesday ordered a cheque for £775 16s. 6d. to be drawn in favour of Messrs. Foy, Morgan, & Co. for timber supplied for the New Works and Stores Department of the Council. It was also agreed to empower the Committee to spend £4,000 for timber and other materials for the various works in hand. The Committee have arranged for a covering insurance to be effected on the stock of timber and materials at the Central Works, Belvedere Road, Lambeth, and also on a quantity of timber, lying at the docks. The Council also ordered cheques to be drawn in favour of Messrs. Watson & Hiscox, timber merchants, for £18 18s. 6d. for timber supplied to the Royal Dockyard Wharf, Woolwich, for £18 for the construction of a school at Crossness Outfall, and of Messrs. B. Ward & Co. for £33 8s. 6d. for laying wood block flooring at the same school.\nSOUTHAMPTON.—A notice from the Carpenter and Joiners' Union demanding an advance of 1d per hour, that is from 7d. to 8d. in the housebuilding trade, was subsequently altered to an advance of ½d per hour. There was a meeting of the employers on the 9th. The men were invited to attend, but declined to wait and discuss the matter. After the 3rd inst. Owing to statements in local papers of various firms having conceded to the demands of the men, in some cases without any truth, certain employers decided to give the advance, but at the adjourned meeting on the 9th, when twenty-two employers were represented, it was unanimously decided that the state of trade did not warrant any advance, which it was decided to adjourn. The joiners employed in the shipbuilding yards the men were receiving 32s. 6d. per week, and demanded an advance to 33s. The masters offered 34s., but this having been refused, the offer was withdrawn, and the men will not be taken back except at the old rate. With regard to the men employed in the different companies' works part only have gone out from one factory, the others continuing at the former rate of pay, varying from 7d. to 7½d.\n\nJUNE 17, 1893.\nWO[?]\nLONDON SAL[?]\nThe following Goods were sold by Public Auction, by\nMESSRS.
