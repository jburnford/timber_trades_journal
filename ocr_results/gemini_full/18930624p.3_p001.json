  "text": "JUNE 24, 1893.\n697\nGLASGOW.\n\nTIMBER MARKET.\nA little more business was experienced this week, but the attendance from country towns was still somewhat meagre. Nothing of special interest has agitated the trade; prices have not drooped for the moment and a more healthy condition of the trade in this district is anticipated for some time at least.\nAt the Exchange the outports were fully represented, and many had to return home with almost empty books. Attention was more directed to mutual conversation than to the placing of orders. The following were present from any, viz.:—\nMessrs. M. Thomson & Co. (Bell & Sime), Dundee.\nMr. John Mitchell (John Mitchell & Co.), Leith.\nMr. Land (Laidlaw, Land & Roger), Leith.\nMr. Baird (Baird & Co.), Falkirk.\nMr. Muirhead (Muirhead & Son), Grangemouth.\nMr. Wilkie (P. & J. Wilkie), Grangemouth.\nMr. Salvesen (J. T. Salvesen & Co.), Grangemouth.\nMr. Melville (R. Melville & Co.), Falkirk.\nMr. McLean (J. McLean & Co.), Grangemouth.\nMr. Young (J. Young & Co.), Paisley.\nMessrs. McPherson & McLaren, Grangemouth.\nMr. Graham, Grahamston.\nMr. Anderson (W. Anderson & Co.), Grangemouth.\nMr. Cowan (W. Cowan & Sons), Grangemouth.\nThe only home trade present were:—\nMr. Robert Herbert.\nMr. Luke.\nMr. Haybridge.\nMr. Dunblane.\nMr. Crieff.\nMr. Motherwell.\n\nFORESTRY IN GERMANY.\nThe forests of Germany cover 13,900,600 hectares, that is, 25.7 per cent. of the total area of the Empire; this amounts to 0.28 hectare per inhabitant. According to proprietorship, we may distinguish forest-lands belonging to the State and the crown, 32.9 per cent.; various communities, 15.2 per cent.; endowed institutions, 1.3 per cent.; corporations, 5 per cent.; and private persons, 45.6 per cent. The forests are composed to the extent of 65.5 per cent. with conifers, and 34.5 per cent. with deciduous trees. The individual varieties of timber show the following percentage of area covered by each:—Scotch fir, 42.6; pines, 22.6; larch, 0.3; total, 65.5; birch, alder, and aspens, 14.8; beech, 14.8; 3.1; copse, 3.1; and oak, 1.8 per cent. The most prevalent variety of timber is the fir, which occupies more than half the forest-area of Prussia and two-fifths of that of the German Empire.\nIn German forestry, two methods of procedure in cultivation are used. In the one, the wood is raised from the seed; in the other, from the roots and trunks.\n\nJUNE 24, 1893.\nThe Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\nrecognised in Germany as a necessity, proved to be such by the history of our forests. The authority of the Government extends to a general supervision of the property and methods of operation, and to a control of the disposal of the products. Private forestry is to-day almost free from any State supervision and subject to no legal control other than that which the general good requires. The supervision is stricter in the South and West, especially in Prussia. Timber is exported from Germany to France, Belgium, Holland, Great Britain, Switzerland, and Denmark, and the export of wooden wares to Russia and America is considerable.\nIn proper appreciation of the importance of the forests from an economic and climatic standpoint, within the last few decades throughout Germany the conversion of barren belts of land not adapted to agriculture into forest-land has been begun; and it is a matter of pleasure to perceive that the time when the area of our forests will have been greatly increased lies in an indefinitely distant future.—Kuhlow's Review.\n\nBRITISH FOREST TREES is the title of a new work published by Messrs. Macmillan & Co. It is written by Mr John Nisbet, and dedicated to the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, \"through whose efforts so much has been done to promote the better knowledge of woodcraft throughout Britain.\"\n\nTHE ROYAL SHOW AT CHESTER.—Several Scotch firms have been exhibiting at the Chester Show of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. Messrs. A. Wood & Sons, 8 and 10, Stockwell Street, Glasgow, showed their weighing machines, and Mr. J. D. McJanet, of the Woodside Engineering Works, Edinburgh, exhibited a weighbridge made by Messrs. Davie & Son, of the same town. Turbines of an efficient type were displayed by Messrs. Carrick & Ritchie, of the Waverley Engineering Works, Edinburgh. The other Scotch exhibits were of purely agricultural interest.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nJune 13 Bien—Brevig—10 lds. firewood—McIntosh\n14 Yrso—Windau—339 lds. sawn fir—Todd Moffat\n16 Anna Dorothea—Wanevik—2 lds. firewood—C.
