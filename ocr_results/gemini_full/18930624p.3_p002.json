June 9.\nGLASGOW AND WEST OF SCOTLAND.—\nMr. A. J. Hunter reports that the state of\nthe coal trade in Ayrshire has been of\nan unsatisfactory character. Little more than half time\nhas been worked for several months over\nthe greater portion of the county, and\nreductions have brought down wages. In\nLanarkshire the miners have only worked\nthree and a half days a week on an average\nfor quite four months, and a fortnight ago\na general reduction of 6d. per day was\nenforced by the employers.

The\ncollieries in the western part of Stirlingshire\nhave had regular work for the past three\nweeks since the resumption of work, after a\nfortnight's stoppage, in resistance of a reduction of 6d. a day. In the eastern part of the\ncounty work has been slack, partly owing to\nthe doubts entertained as to the course the\nminers might take on the wage question.\nReductions have been made of from 4d. to\n6d. per day at several collieries. In the\niron and steel trades the smelters consider that trade has never been so\nbad before. They do not anticipate\nfurther reductions, and the question\nof a sliding scale has been discussed in a\nfriendly conference with the employers.\nThe makers, engineers, iron moulders, blacksmiths and tin-plate workers, all give\nunfavourable reports, but the patternmakers in the Clyde district have been well\nemployed for the last three months, and have\nonly about 3 per cent. of their men idle.\nThe position of the building trades is still\ngood. The sett-makers report that the\npaving trade has not been so busy for years;\nwork is plentiful in the quarries, in the west\nof Scotland, and all over the country (granite\nis included) trade is unusually active.\n\nFORTHCOMING AUCTION SALES.\nJUNE.\nARBROATH Saw-mill Company Wednesday, 21st\nLEITH D.
