GLASGOW AND WEST OF SCOTLAND.—
Mr. A. J. Hunter reports that the state of
the coal trade in Ayrshire has been of
an unsatisfactory character. Little more than half time
has been worked for several months over
the greater portion of the county, and
reductions have brought down wages. In
Lanarkshire the miners have only worked
three and a half days a week on an average
for quite four months, and a fortnight ago
a general reduction of 6d. per day was
enforced by the employers. The miners,

having adopted the four days a week system
of restriction since the last general reduction
was enforced, are now agitating to have the
amount of the reduction restored. The
collieries in the western part of Stirlingshire
have had regular work for the past three
weeks since the resumption of work, after a
fortnight's stoppage, in resistance of a reduction of 6d. a day. In the eastern part of the
county work has been slack, partly owing to
the doubts entertained as to the course the
miners might take on the wage question.
Reductions have been made of from 4d. to
6d. per day at several collieries. In the
iron and steel trades the smelters consider that trade has never been so
bad before. They do not anticipate
further reductions, and the question
of a sliding scale has been discussed in a
friendly conference with the employers.
The makers, engineers, iron moulders, blacksmiths and tin-plate workers, all give
unfavourable reports, but the patternmakers in the Clyde district have been well
employed for the last three months, and have
only about 3 per cent. of their men idle.
The position of the building trades is still
good. The sett-makers report that the
paving trade has not been so busy for years;
work is plentiful in the quarries, in the west
of Scotland, and all over the country (granite
is included) trade is unusually active.
