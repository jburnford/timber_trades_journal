Binney & Co., timber merchants and joinery manufacturers, of the Hope Works and Roding Wharf, Ilford, Essex, have issued a new catalogue giving the prices and sections of their English manufactured architrave base and door mouldings, bolection mouldings, architraves, and grounds, skirtings, sash bars and beads, sashes and frames, cornices and rollers, doors, sashes and frames, and other specialities. The list is printed with a chocolate-coloured ink, and the arrangement will be of service to buyers of such goods. We commend Messrs. Binney & Co.’s new catalogue to builders and contractors throughout the country.\n\n795\n\nGAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nBAYLEY, W. F., builder.—At the Dudley County Court, before Judge Griffiths, Mr. Hugo Young applied for the discharge of this debtor, who carried on business as a builder at Great Bridge. The application was opposed by Mr. E. P. Jobson (Official Receiver), and Mr. W. Shakespeare on behalf of the creditors. Mr. Shakespeare said seven years had elapsed since the petition was filed, and contended that the fact of the debtor having been an undischarged bankrupt for so long a period entitled him to release when he ought to have known he was insolvent. He gave fraudulent preferences to some of his creditors. Mr. Young admitted that his client did not keep all the books that were necessary. Mr. Shakespeare said he appeared on behalf of almost every creditor in the bankruptcy, and it was one of the worst cases that had been brought before the Court. The petition was filed in March, 1886, and although the first meeting was held in that month, the public examination was not closed until November, 1887. The examination had to be postponed for six months, because the debtor could not file his accounts. The liabilities were estimated at £3,782 11s. 4d., and his assets, which he said would realise £3,692, only realised £409, and he paid a dividend of 6d. in the pound. His Honour said he considered it was a very bad case, and he did not see any reason why he should discharge the debtor now or at any future date.\n\nGOSHER, EDWIN JAMES, builder, Prestburg.—This debtor made an application for his discharge at the Cheltenham County Court on Friday. The receiving order was made in February, 1890, and debtor was adjudged bankrupt on the 3rd of March following. He applied for his discharge on April 10th, 1891. Judge Brynmor Jones adjourned the case for twelve months. More than two years had elapsed since that application, and Mr. Waghorne submitted that the bankrupt had wiped out his offence. The Official Receiver said the statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £51, and assets estimated at £9 only. No dividend had been or could be paid, as the assets were 3s. 7d. less than the expenses of and incidental to the banking. His Honour eventually suspended the discharge for four months.\n\nGRANT, FRED, builder and contractor, and proprietor of Steam Joinery Works, Rugby Cottages, Mill Road, Cleethorpes.—The following are creditors in this bankruptcy:—\n£ s. d.\nBaxendale & Co., Manchester ... ... ... 50 0 0\nDowsow J., Cleethorpes ... ... ... 85 0 0\nHiggs —, Barton-on-Humber ... ... ... 79 9 3\nBrown G., Grimsby ... ... ... 50 0 0\nForstall & Hanwell, Hull ... ... ... 24 15 5\nCarlisle & Clegg, Manchester ... ... ... 50 10 8\nChapman W.

J. P., builder and contractor, Strood, Kent.—At the Rochester Bankruptcy Court last week the debtor appeared before Registrar Smith for his adjourned public examination. The debtor said he had borrowed money at a high rate of interest. He had had strikes of his men, and had had to employ others, and to pay for their lodgings. Eventually the examination was again adjourned for the debtor to file certain accounts.\n\nPITT, WILLIAM, builder, Maindee, Mon.—An application was made at the Newport, Mon., Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, for the discharge of this debtor. His Honour said the debtor had lost a large sum in building speculations at Barry. He considered the case was a serious one, as only 3d. in the pound had been paid on debts amounting to £500. The application was adjourned, as it was stated that three motions were pending respecting preferential payments made by the debtor.\n\nROGERS, EDWARD, coachbuilder, College Place, Bristol.—The first meeting of the creditors was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Bristol. Mr. C. Wintle appeared for the debtor, and creditors were represented by Mr. E. T. Parker. The statement of affairs",
