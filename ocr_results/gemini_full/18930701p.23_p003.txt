FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BEST, FRANK, contractor, Blandford.
—A private meeting of the creditors of this trader has been held at the offices of Mr. W. E. Brennand, solicitor, Blandford. The liabilities were represented as £965, and the assets £345. The debtor had no offer to make, and it was decided to appoint Mr. C. E. Porter, auctioneer, trustee, with Messrs. C. S. Roe, F. Hardy, and J. Dalrymple as a committee of inspection, having power to realise the estate at the end of fourteen days, the debtor being allowed that period to enable him, if possible, to offer 10s. in the pound.
GARNAR, A. & W., builders and con-tractors, Frankton Road, Peckham.—A sitting for the public examination of the bankrupts was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hope. The statement of affairs showed gross liabili-ties £10,598 13s. 10d., of which £7,687 7s. 11d. are fully secured and £2,794 1s. 6d. expected to rank, the assets being estimated at £1,951 18s. 10d. The debtors commenced business in November, 1888, with £8,240 capital, and traded as above until May, 1890, when they were subsequently adjudged bank-rupt. About October, 1890, with borrowed money, they took over the said premises, with the machinery, &c., thereat (which were sub-sequently purchased by their cousin from the trustee under their bankruptcy and let to them), and resumed business, which they continued down to the date of the receiving order. Under the bankruptcy of June, 1890, the liabilities were returned at £2,762, and dividends amounting to 14s. 6d. are stated to have been paid, the discharge being granted in August, 1890. The bankrupts attributed their present failure to bad debts; to loss through a dispute in connection with a contract, which prevented them from meeting their engagements; and to pressure by creditors. Mr. Mackintosh appeared for the trustee, and Mr. H. Brougham as Official Receiver; and Messrs. E. & C. Braby, creditors, were also represented. The bankrupts were examined upon their course of trading, and as to payments made and securities given to par-ticular creditors, and in the result his Honour allowed them to pass.
GLANVILLE, JOHN E. E., builder, Devonport. For five years debtor had carried on business as a builder, and on Tuesday his examination was adjourned until July 25, debtor being ordered to file a goods and cash account for twelve months. His unsecured liabilities were £777, and assets £535, and after paying preferential claims there was a deficiency of £261.
GREENWOOD, P. A., upholsterers, warehouseman and saw-mill proprietor, 74, Curtain Road, E.C.—The debtor, also described as of Church Road, Bethnal Green, and 334, Romford Road, E., has filed his petition, and last week, upon the application of Mr. Ernest Lloyd, the usual receiving order was made. The liabilities are returned at about £4,000, and the assets appear to consist chiefly of stock of the estimated value of about £700, and book debts £400.
HOCKING, W. J. P., builder, Strood.—The examination of the debtor, whose case has been reported in these columns, was concluded at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court last week, before Mr. Registrar Hayward. The debtor was allowed to pass, subject to signing the notes of his public examination.
LISTER, W. J., builder, 37, Snow Hill, E.C. —This failure occurred in November last, and the bankrupt applied on Friday to Mr. Registrar Brougham for his order of discharge. The Official Receiver reported that proofs of debt had been made for £3,014 13s. 6d., and that a dividend of 3s. 6d. in the pound had been paid, and that 3d. in the pound further was likely to be distributed. The failure was attributed to loss on contracts and bad debts. It appeared that the bankrupt was insolvent in December, 1891, and had for some years been short of capital, and obliged to ask his creditors for time. He con-tinued business, however, and, of the unsecured indebtedness, upwards of £800 had been incurred since March, 1892. The offences reported were: Trading after knowledge of insolvency, imper-fect bookkeeping, and the insufficiency of the assets to pay 10s. in the pound. Mr. E. L. Hough appeared as Official Receiver, Mr. Street for the trustee, and Mr. Cohen on behalf of the bankrupt. His Honour suspended the order of discharge for two years.
PEARCE, F., builder and contractor, 16, Red Lion Square, W.C. This case has been already reported, and the bankrupt passed his examination last week before Mr. Registrar Brougham, the accounts showing unsecured debts £283 19s. 2d. and assets £129 16s.
