Among them will be found a most interesting consignment from Balmoral, lent by the Queen, as well as a vast number of examples of what may be termed curiosities of forestry, illustrating abnormal growths and eccentricities of tree life. Other exhibits set forth the varying effects on timber of salt and fresh water, and the ravages of insects.\n\nMOFFAT. — The Commissioners have obtained a report from Messrs. Woodhouse & Rawson, electrical engineers, Glasgow, with respect to the proposal that the town should be lighted by the electric light.

The cost of arc accumulator batteries or small accumulator distributing stations for the supply of private houses is not included. The report states that after supplying the arc lamps in the streets the light available for sale would equal £1,946 13s. 4d. a year.\n\nJAMES JOHNSTON,\nTimber Merchant & Saw-miller,\nTHE SHORE,\nSTIRLING.\n\nGEORGE HALLIDAY,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchant & Saw-miller,\nRothesay Saw-mills, ROTHESAY.\nA large stock of Baltic and American Timber, all kinds of home-grown Timber, well-seasoned Spokes, Naves, &c.\nManufacturer of Flooring, Mouldings, Architraves &c.\nEvery description of Turned Goods.\nTreads, always on hand.\n\nROBERT HOWIE & SONS,\nNEWMILL, DUNLOP,\nTimber Merchants, Joiners, & Cartwrights,\nMakers of Washing Machines, Scythe Snads, Hand Rakes, and Agricultural Woodwork of all descriptions.\nA large Stock of seasoned Hardwoods always on hand and the trade supplied on liberal terms.",
