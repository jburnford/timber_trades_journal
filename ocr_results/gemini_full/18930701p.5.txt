THE GARDENING AND FORESTRY EXHIBITION AT EARL'S COURT.—The forestry section of the Exhibition is now fairly complete, and nearly all the exhibits promised by official bodies and private individuals are now in evidence. Among them will be found a most interesting consignment from Balmoral, lent by the Queen, as well as a vast number of examples of what may be termed curiosities of forestry, illustrating abnormal growths and eccentricities of tree life. Other exhibits set forth the varying effects on timber of salt and fresh water, and the ravages of insects.

MOFFAT. — The Commissioners have obtained a report from Messrs. Woodhouse & Rawson, electrical engineers, Glasgow, with respect to the proposal that the town should be lighted by the electric light. It is proposed to use the waterfall at Skellywell on the River Evan, Mr. William Younger, of Auchencastle, having consented, exclusive of buildings, &c., but including the requisite plant and fitting up the same, the cost is stated at £3,879. The cost of arc accumulator batteries or small accumulator distributing stations for the supply of private houses is not included. The report states that after supplying the arc lamps in the streets the light available for sale would equal £1,946 13s. 4d. a year.
