assert itself in this market, and hard to pitch pine, which has for some time forced upon consumers at very low and unremunerative prices. Though there has not been much change in prices so far, there is not the general pressure to sell, and the advance in freights, along with the disinclination of merchants to come forward, will enhance the price of this wood in a very short time.
A special feature in local shipbuilding during June was the large order booked by Russell & Co. for two steamers of 6,000 tons burthen each, and two of 6,000 tons burthen by D. & W. Henderson & Co. It is also said to have contracted to build a number of 4,500 tons for R. Mackill & Co., Glasgow. Scott & Co. booked an order for a 250 ton steamer for J. & J. Denholm, Greenock. A. Rodger & Co. have also secured one of the numerous orders offered by Burrell & Son. The launches during the month included three large steamers by Russell & Co., one large steamer by W. Hamilton & Co., and a large sailing vessel by Scott & Co. for French owners.
We publish this week the statement of stock at Greenock and Port Glasgow for quarter ending 30th June last.

AMERICAN CARRIAGE WOOD.
Mr. George Wilson, of Universal Wharf, 27, Bankside, S.E., the English representative of Messrs. Crane & Macmahon, of New York, has issued the following circular to the trade:—
In consequence of the very many Australian and Colonial bank failures, without a moment's notice, London and discount houses, who up to a fortnight ago refused to cash at any price nearly all or any drafts in so far as these were related to Australia and the Colonies.
As a result, many millions of American dollars are for the time being locked up in the shape of undiscountable paper, and then only realisable at maturity.
Consignments of merchandise also representing great value has had to be withdrawn from shipment, pending negotiations by the several banking companies for a reconstruction.
The result of such disastrous failures has been to act heavily upon my firm in consequence of the fact that 80 per cent. of their goods have all been made to pattern suitable for the Colonial trade, and therefore altogether useless for use in Europe.

The Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.
JULY 8, 1893.
The specifications include the sizes and grades at the moment on hand, and any others not included therein will be either arriving shortly or shipped immediately at my call by cable.
Prices you will expect to be reduced, and in that I am willing to meet you immediately.
That is to say for any orders sent in to me, I offer, therefore, to sell all spokes, long and short, at the 22 in. price, but then only provided there is a fair proportion of 22 in. ordered.
That is to say 28 in. spokes will for the present be sold at 22 in price, which is an extra discount of 7½ per cent. on all the 28 in. lengths.
Failing any 22 in. being required, 5 per cent. will be the special discount off the 28 in. long.
Settlements, although essential, can be arranged according to circumstances and to your convenience either by cheque payable immediately with a discount, or by draft for two, three, or four months, and any of which will for the present be on English paper is once while colonial is not.
Fourteen days ago New York almost came to a panic, and such firms as were wholly of inestimable value as their assets are convertible into dollars at a moment's notice is not.
The scarcity of money in New York created a panic, and such firms as were depending upon the immediate realisation of colonial drafts to meet their obligations were compelled for temporary loans to pay as much as 25 per cent. premium.
Indeed, many firms have failed through their being unable to get through the squeeze, and amongst the number my firm is one house of very old standing, who have in excess of their liabilities assets for over 200,000 dols.
I mention these facts as an explanation for the reduced prices at which I now offer to sell, and at the same time to be pleased to observe that whether this intimation be effectual or not in realising the stock prices hereafter will remain as heretofore, unless, through unforeseen circumstances, a higher scale may have to be resorted to, but in any case prices will not get lower.
