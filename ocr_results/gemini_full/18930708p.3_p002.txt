THE AFFORESTATION OF WASTE AREAS IN SCOTLAND.
AND ITS ADVANTAGES.
By W. A. MACKENZIE.

THE fact that there are vast areas of land upon which it is impossible to grow anything fully profitable is well known. Not only so, the rulers of the country are constantly putting forth every effort to provide a means of supply, in order that the people may be more fully employed, and to prevent the emigrating of many of our most promising youths to other lands. If the owners of such land, more necessary than any other class, would but see the immense advantages to be derived, not only for themselves, but for the nation at large, they would not hesitate to have such ground planted. They would see that they themselves, and their successors after them, would be very considerably benefited as a consequence. They would also see that the question of the unemployed, which would otherwise have to be provided for by the country, would be to a large extent solved; the comfort and happiness of the people in the rank and file of life would be enhanced; before many years had passed by the trade and manufactures of the country would be improved; and many of the social problems which at election times are made so much of by the more advanced politicians would be solved.
More than this, it would prevent a scarcity of timber, which is at present being felt, and employ a vast amount of capital in the enterprise.
At the present time, we have to depend on such countries as Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the countries of North America for our supply, and after paying freight, insurance, and conveyance, we find that the price we have to pay for this necessary commodity is very much
