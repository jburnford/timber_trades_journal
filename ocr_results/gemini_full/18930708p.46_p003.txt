THE TEAK MARKET.
Messrs. Denny, Mott, & Dickson in their circular state that deliveries from the docks in London last month were 1,361 loads, as against 1,444 loads for the corresponding month of last year.
1,906 loads were landed during the month, so that stocks now show an increase of nearly 20 per cent. on last year's stocks in London.
The following are the comparisons between the last half-year and the corresponding one of 1892, viz., from January 1st to June 30th :-
1893. 1892.
Loads. Loads.
Landings in London Docks ... 10,419 against 5,088
Deliveries from London Docks ... 6,648 " 5,662
showing this half-year an increase of about 80 per cent. on the landings and 17 per cent. on the consumption.
The increase in the consumption is more than accounted for by the deliveries made from London to H.M. Admiralty, which, as a rule, supplies its requirements from floating rather than from landed stocks; and consumption has, therefore, shown a falling off on the reduced consumption of 1892, the deliveries for the six months of which year fell 7 1/2 per cent. below those for the same period of 1891.
The floating supplies are moderate and mostly allocated, whilst good timber is so scarce in Burmah that the averages of cargo specifications have had to be reduced; but these facts have been more than counteracted by the difficulty in selling floating cargoes and the generally poor demand on this side, and prices have given way seriously, some forced auction sales having helped to depress the views of dealers, although consignment parcels sent forward under the temptation of securing cheap steam freight, without regard to requirements on this side, have had the chief share in demoralising the market.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that creditors whose names are published hold security for their debts, often for the full amount.]

FRICKER, HEYWOOD,
timber merchant, Hammersmith, again appeared before Mr. T. W. J. Britten, the Official Receiver, at the Bankruptcy Court, when the bankruptcy was adjourned.
The debtor had filed certain accounts, but the Official Receiver said the accounts were incomplete, and he would have to be adjudicated bankrupt to enable the trustee in bankruptcy to get in the estate, to which he admitted he had no objection.
The accounts filed were not accurate.
The debtor said there was a deficiency of Â£1,000 in the debtor's cash account.
The bankrupt showed a surplus on the statement.
The meeting was again adjourned.

HEYWOOD, W., 104, Uxbridge Road, Hammersmith, builder.
In this case was made the receiving order on the petition, the act of bankruptcy being seizure and sale of the debtor's effects about March 15th last.
The first meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday last, before the Official Receiver.
The statement of affairs showed creditors unsecured Â£1,300, and fully secured Â£13,000, the securities being valued at Â£3,326 16s. 10d., leaving an estimated surplus to meet the unsecured creditors.
The debtor stated that he commenced business as a builder in 1888 at 59, Queen Street, Hammersmith, and in or about 1886 to the present time, again, in or about 1889, at 104, Uxbridge Road, Hammersmith, which was the date of the receiving order.
He stated that in addition to his business as a builder and contractor, he had entered into speculations in building land at Harlesden.
He attributed his losses in respect of these speculations and to inability to realise his bills, to bad debts, and other causes.
The Official Receiver reported that the books of account were very imperfect, being an incomplete cash book and a creditor's ledger.
The creditors fully secured held mortgages on the debtor's freehold and leasehold houses at Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush, and also at Putney.
The estate, the Official Receiver said, is, however, so involved that consequently he could not say what would be an available asset for the unsecured and principal creditors.
The following are the principal creditors:-
