sufficient for an imperial acre. When sown broadcast, the seeds should be mixed with some foreign substance to enable this small quantity (2 lbs.) to be properly spread over so large an area. Any friable substance will do for this purpose, providing the seeds are evenly mixed with it. Fine seeds should only be sown in the drier soils, such as those having good natural drainage, or on soils properly drained by artificial means.
