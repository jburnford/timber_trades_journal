STORNOWAY.—The sum of £630 is to be expended in the improvement of Mossend Hospital, and for the erection of a shelter.
LEITH.—The contract for the lodging-house to be erected by the Corporation in Parliament Street has been secured by Mr. J. Kinnear, builder.

EXTRACT FROM ROBERT HAMILTON & Co.'s WOOD CIRCULAR.—The market has been quiet but steady during June, and while a moderate amount of business has been transacted, there is a want of inquiry, the prices remain generally unchanged. The annexed tables show that upon the whole the imports have been moderate and the deliveries fair, but the present stocks are equal to an increased demand. During the past half year the tonnage launched on the Clyde district amounts to about 121,000 tons, being a falling off of about 60,000 tons when compared with the same time last year. About 30,000 tons of new work was secured last month, but the bulk being cargo steamers, the wood trade is not greatly benefited. The rates of wood freights have slightly improved, which adds somewhat to c.i.f. quotations, and should help stocks on hand. The Bank of England rates has receded from 4 per cent. a month ago to 2½ per cent., against 2 per cent. in 1892, 2½ per cent. in 1891, and 4 per cent. in 1890.

BUILDING NOTES.
CARLUKE SCHOOL BOARD. — Plans of a proposed addition to the Market Place School have been approved, the estimated cost being £3,000.
EDINBURGH.—At a meeting of the Public Health Committee on the 4th inst., a report was submitted by the Fever Hospital Sub-Committee recommending general approval of a block plan of the proposed additions and alterations on the City Fever Hospital, prepared by the city superintendent of works. The probable cost is set down at £50,000. The committee resolved to recommend general approval of the plans to the magistrates and Council, and to claim a remit, if the plans are approved, to prepare plans and specifications, and to obtain estimates for the work.
GREENOCK.—Messrs. White & Gilmour, engineers and steam-launch builders, have had plans prepared for the erection of new works in Robertson Street.
HELENSBURGH.—A report by Mr. Wilson, C.E., Greenock, recommending that an 8 in. pipe be laid from No. 1 well to No. 2 well, to increase the water supply from Bally-voulin, at a probable cost of £1,380, has been approved. Plans are to be prepared and estimates obtained for carrying out the work.
LAUNCH.—At Renfrew, on the 5th July, Messrs. Wm. Simons & Co. launched, complete from their yard, a large hopper steamer for the Clyde Trustees, the leading dimensions of which are : length 205 ft., breadth 35 ft., depth 15 ft. 6 in. The hopper has a capacity for 1,200 tons of material. The vessel is propelled by two sets of triple expansion engines and twin screws capable of steaming at a speed of 10½ knots per hour when loaded. It is built under the British Corporation requirements and survey. This makes the eleventh vessel that W. Simons & Co. have built for the Clyde Trust, their connection extending as far back as 1861, when they built for them two hopper barges, which were the first vessels of this class propelled by steam.
LEITH.—A new shipbuilding yard and engineering works are shortly to be started at Leith. A large piece of ground has been acquired from the Dock Commission, at the north side of the Queen's Dock, on which workshops and engineering premises are being erected. Already a good deal of the machinery has been placed in position. The new establishment will, it is stated, be under the management of Mr. Nicol Arthur, who was for some time manager in Messrs. Ramage & Ferguson's yard. The firm have secured an order to build several barges for the Thames.
