Leary\nLEGAL INTELLIGENCE.\nDUNDEE BILL OF LADING DISPUTE.\nMORGAN, GELLIBRAND & CO., &c. v ROYAL\nBANK OF SCOTLAND, &c.\nIn the Court of Session on July 12th, before\nthe Lord President and Lords Adam, M'Laren,\nand Kinnear, this case was heard.\nIn this action Morgan, Gellibrand & Co.,\nmerchants, 1, St. Helen's Place, London, and\nDonald Brothers & Co., merchants, Mobile,\nAlabama, sued the Royal Bank of Scotland\nand others for payment of £688 10s. 5d., con-\nsigned in the Dundee branch of the bank on\nFebruary 15th, 1892, and for £300 damages.\nMorgan & Co. are the agents in Great Britain\nfor Donald & Co. In November, 1891,\nthe latter shipped a cargo of timber on\nboard the barque Lakme. Bills of lading\nwere made out to the order of Morgan & Co.\nThe vessel went to Dundee, where the agent\nfor Morgan & Co. sold the cargo on 21st\nNovember, 1891, receiving from the Jessiman\npurchaser a bill for £820 17s. 1d. The latter\nreceived one of the duplicate bills of lading,\nthe pursuers retaining the other. On 29th\nDecember, 1891, the purchaser handed the bill\nof lading to the bank without, it was said,\nreceiving value therefore, but in security of\nadvances which the bank had previously made\nto him. The pursuers state that on 11th\nJanuary, 1892, the purchaser issued a circular to\nhis creditors, announcing that he was unable to\nmeet his liabilities. To protect the pursuers'\nrights, Morgan & Co.'s Dundee agent stopped\nthe goods in transitu. The vessel arrived on 20th\n\nJanuary, 1892. By agreement between the bank\nand the trustee, the cargo was sold for £820 17s.\n1d., the amount first sued for being retained by\nthe bank. The bank, who defended the action,\nstated that in September, 1891, they received\nfrom Jessiman a bill of lading for a cargo\nof timber from Quebec, that the ship was\nexpected to arrive in December, and that the\nbill of lading was for the purpose of their\ndelivering in place thereof the bill of lading for\nthe timber per Lakme. The bank averred\nthat they were entitled to the proceeds of the\nsale of the cargo, and explained that the alleged\nthe purchaser's estates were sequestrated. The\nmain question in the case was whether the bank\nwere onerous endorsees of the bill of lading, and\nthe consignment of timber by the Lakme. Lord\nLow in the Outer House held that the de-\nfenders were onerous endorsees of the bill, but\nthe view which he had taken of the evidence\nwas that the transference of the bill of lading\nwas not a voluntary conveyance in security of a\nprior debt, but a transaction in the ordinary\ncourse of dealing between the parties, in which\nimmediate value was given and received. The\ndefenders were assoilzied with expenses. The\npursuers reclaimed, and to-day the First\nDivision adhered to the judgment of the Lord\nOrdinary, with expenses.\nLord M'Laren, who gave the leading opinion,\nsaid the question in the case was whether the\nRoyal Bank, the holders of an endorsed bill of\nlading relating to a cargo of timber, were\nentitled to delivery of the cargo in that bill, in\ncompetition with the seller or consigner of the\ngoods, who had claimed the right to stop them in\ntransitu. The Lord Ordinary, without dealing\nspecially with the question of whether they were\nentitled to stop them in the circumstances, went\non to hold that on the assumption of such right\nthe bank were notwithstanding entitled to prevail\nover the right of the seller, in respect that\nthey held the bill of lading for a valuable con-\nsideration, and free from fraud or any equities\nwhich might otherwise interfere with the\nacquisition of such a right. On the first point\nit was perhaps not necessary that he should say\nmuch, because his opinion was with the Lord\nOrdinary on the second point. But from the\nevidence he should be disposed to think that\nMorgan, Gellibrand & Co., the consigners, were\nnot going outside the limits of their rights in\nattempting to stop delivery of this cargo, because\nJessiman's circumstances were not such as to\njustify them in taking that step, provided their\nadverse rights had been acquired to the goods\nwhen the vessel only arrived on the 20th\nJanuary, and at the time that the bill of lading\nwas consigned to Jessiman, that was on the\n29th December, the bill was handed to the\nRoyal Bank as a security for an overdraft; and\nthe question was whether, in the circumstances,\nthat was a good transaction of security. The\ncircumstances were that for many years Jessi-\nman had been carrying on his business on\ncredit. The bank had accepted the security of\nhis father for £6,000, but latterly Jessiman had\nbeen exceeding that overdraft, and upon his\nattention being called to the state of his\naccount he offered to give the only\nsecurity he had, namely, the bills of\nlading on cargoes which might be con-\nsigned to him. Apparently he was not a man\nin a very large way of business, and he gene-\nrally had only one cargo coming to him at a\ntime, and what he did was this—he first\nendorsed the bill of lading to the bank, and\nthen, before the ship arrived, he generally had\ngot the bill of lading of another ship. He got\nthe first bill in order to enable him to take\ndelivery, and gave the second bill in exchange.\nIt was not disputed that the re-delivery of a\ncurrent bill of lading was a good consideration,\nbecause the bank parted with a valuable right\nin returning their security to the granter in\nexchange for an equally good right of a different\ndescription. The bank, in the course of\ndealing, held a bill of lading for a cargo of\ntimber in the ship Stralsund, and on the 29th\nDecember, when the bill of lading of the\nLakme was given by Jessiman in exchange for\nit, the bank agents did not know that the Stral-\nsund had arrived, and that Jessiman had, the\nLord Ordinary said fraudulently, taken delivery\nof the cargo, part of which was then in his yard.\nBut while, when the exchange was made, the bill of\nlading of the Stralsund was worthless as a\nnegotiable instrument, the bank at that time in\ntheir state of knowledge considered it a bill of\nlading for an undelivered cargo; and therefore\nin parting with the bill of lading of the Stral-\nsund, were giving valuable consideration for the\nbill of the Lakme. Therefore the bank held a\npreferable claim to the cargo of the Lakme.\nTheir Lordships concurred.\nCounsel for the Pursuers—Mr. Guthrie and\nMr. Wilson. Agents—Carmont, Wedderburn, &\nWatson, W.S.\nCounsel for the Defenders—Mr. Graham Mur-\nray, Q.C., and Mr. Dundas.

Mr. Tovey has since been\npaying his creditors 20s. in the £, and is now in a\nperfectly solvent position. The partnership was\nadjourned.\nEDWARD GLANVILLE.\nAt the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court, last week,\nbefore Mr. T. H. Bewes, the Official Receiver,\nEdward Glanville, timber merchant, of Devonport,\nand residing at Plymouth, came up for his public\nexamination. The statement of affairs showed that\nthe gross liabilities were £1,744 1s. 11d., of which\n£1,111 was expected to rank against the estate\nfor dividend. The assets were estimated to produce\n£406 4s. 1d. The debtor attributed his failure to\nbad debts, to losses on contracts, to heavy interest\non borrowed money, and to keen competition.\nReplying to the Official Receiver, the debtor\nstated that he commenced business in Devonport in\n1887 with a capital of £150. He had been in\npartnership with his son, but the partnership\nwas adjudged a debtor to the amount of £1,744.",
