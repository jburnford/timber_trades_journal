LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
DUNDEE BILL OF LADING DISPUTE.
MORGAN, GELLIBRAND & CO., &c. v ROYAL
BANK OF SCOTLAND, &c.
In the Court of Session on July 12th, before
the Lord President and Lords Adam, M'Laren,
and Kinnear, this case was heard.
In this action Morgan, Gellibrand & Co.,
merchants, 1, St. Helen's Place, London, and
Donald Brothers & Co., merchants, Mobile,
Alabama, sued the Royal Bank of Scotland
and others for payment of £688 10s. 5d., con-
signed in the Dundee branch of the bank on
February 15th, 1892, and for £300 damages.
Morgan & Co. are the agents in Great Britain
for Donald & Co. In November, 1891,
the latter shipped a cargo of timber on
board the barque Lakme. Bills of lading
were made out to the order of Morgan & Co.
The vessel went to Dundee, where the agent
for Morgan & Co. sold the cargo on 21st
November, 1891, receiving from the Jessiman
purchaser a bill for £820 17s. 1d. The latter
received one of the duplicate bills of lading,
the pursuers retaining the other. On 29th
December, 1891, the purchaser handed the bill
of lading to the bank without, it was said,
receiving value therefore, but in security of
advances which the bank had previously made
to him. The pursuers state that on 11th
January, 1892, the purchaser issued a circular to
his creditors, announcing that he was unable to
meet his liabilities. To protect the pursuers'
rights, Morgan & Co.'s Dundee agent stopped
the goods in transitu. The vessel arrived on 20th

January, 1892. By agreement between the bank
and the trustee, the cargo was sold for £820 17s.
1d., the amount first sued for being retained by
the bank. The bank, who defended the action,
stated that in September, 1891, they received
from Jessiman a bill of lading for a cargo
of timber from Quebec, that the ship was
expected to arrive in December, and that the
bill of lading was for the purpose of their
delivering in place thereof the bill of lading for
the timber per Lakme. The bank averred
that they were entitled to the proceeds of the
sale of the cargo, and explained that the alleged
the purchaser's estates were sequestrated. The
main question in the case was whether the bank
were onerous endorsees of the bill of lading, and
the consignment of timber by the Lakme. Lord
Low in the Outer House held that the de-
fenders were onerous endorsees of the bill, but
the view which he had taken of the evidence
was that the transference of the bill of lading
was not a voluntary conveyance in security of a
prior debt, but a transaction in the ordinary
course of dealing between the parties, in which
immediate value was given and received. The
defenders were assoilzied with expenses. The
pursuers reclaimed, and to-day the First
Division adhered to the judgment of the Lord
Ordinary, with expenses.
Lord M'Laren, who gave the leading opinion,
said the question in the case was whether the
Royal Bank, the holders of an endorsed bill of
lading relating to a cargo of timber, were
entitled to delivery of the cargo in that bill, in
competition with the seller or consigner of the
goods, who had claimed the right to stop them in
transitu. The Lord Ordinary, without dealing
specially with the question of whether they were
entitled to stop them in the circumstances, went
on to hold that on the assumption of such right
the bank were notwithstanding entitled to prevail
over the right of the seller, in respect that
they held the bill of lading for a valuable con-
sideration, and free from fraud or any equities
which might otherwise interfere with the
acquisition of such a right. On the first point
it was perhaps not necessary that he should say
much, because his opinion was with the Lord
Ordinary on the second point. But from the
evidence he should be disposed to think that
Morgan, Gellibrand & Co., the consigners, were
not going outside the limits of their rights in
attempting to stop delivery of this cargo, because
Jessiman's circumstances were not such as to
justify them in taking that step, provided their
adverse rights had been acquired to the goods
when the vessel only arrived on the 20th
January, and at the time that the bill of lading
was consigned to Jessiman, that was on the
29th December, the bill was handed to the
Royal Bank as a security for an overdraft; and
the question was whether, in the circumstances,
that was a good transaction of security. The
circumstances were that for many years Jessi-
man had been carrying on his business on
credit. The bank had accepted the security of
his father for £6,000, but latterly Jessiman had
been exceeding that overdraft, and upon his
attention being called to the state of his
account he offered to give the only
security he had, namely, the bills of
lading on cargoes which might be con-
signed to him. Apparently he was not a man
in a very large way of business, and he gene-
rally had only one cargo coming to him at a
time, and what he did was this—he first
endorsed the bill of lading to the bank, and
then, before the ship arrived, he generally had
got the bill of lading of another ship. He got
the first bill in order to enable him to take
delivery, and gave the second bill in exchange.
It was not disputed that the re-delivery of a
current bill of lading was a good consideration,
because the bank parted with a valuable right
in returning their security to the granter in
exchange for an equally good right of a different
description. The bank, in the course of
dealing, held a bill of lading for a cargo of
timber in the ship Stralsund, and on the 29th
December, when the bill of lading of the
Lakme was given by Jessiman in exchange for
it, the bank agents did not know that the Stral-
sund had arrived, and that Jessiman had, the
Lord Ordinary said fraudulently, taken delivery
of the cargo, part of which was then in his yard.
But while, when the exchange was made, the bill of
lading of the Stralsund was worthless as a
negotiable instrument, the bank at that time in
their state of knowledge considered it a bill of
lading for an undelivered cargo; and therefore
in parting with the bill of lading of the Stral-
sund, were giving valuable consideration for the
bill of the Lakme. Therefore the bank held a
preferable claim to the cargo of the Lakme.
Their Lordships concurred.

GAZETTE.
PARTNERSHIPS DISSOLVED.
(From the London Gazette of Tuesday, July 12.)
Edward Glanville and Edward Glanville, jun.,
Devonport, timber merchants, under the style of
Edward Glanville & Son.
DAVIS, TOVEY & CO.
About last Christmas Mr. Davis, of the firm of
Davis, Tovey & Co., timber merchants, Cardiff,
left out his partner, Mr. Tovey, and took in
himself and son. Mr. Tovey has since been
paying his creditors 20s. in the £, and is now in a
perfectly solvent position. The partnership was
adjourned.
EDWARD GLANVILLE.
At the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court, last week,
before Mr. T. H. Bewes, the Official Receiver,
Edward Glanville, timber merchant, of Devonport,
and residing at Plymouth, came up for his public
examination. The statement of affairs showed that
the gross liabilities were £1,744 1s. 11d., of which
£1,111 was expected to rank against the estate
for dividend. The assets were estimated to produce
£406 4s. 1d. The debtor attributed his failure to
bad debts, to losses on contracts, to heavy interest
on borrowed money, and to keen competition.
Replying to the Official Receiver, the debtor
stated that he commenced business in Devonport in
1887 with a capital of £150. He had been in
partnership with his son, but the partnership
was adjudged a debtor to the amount of £1,744.
