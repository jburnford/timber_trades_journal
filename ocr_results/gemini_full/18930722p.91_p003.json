C. S. Ross & Co. note a further decrease in the volume of trade. No business of importance had been done at the auctions, and floorings and weatherboards had attracted most attention privately.\nMESSRS. FRASER & Co., Limited, report a little business in certain descriptions of American lumber. For the principal classes of new stock timber, importers are unwilling to make concessions on the prevailing low basis of values. Some good sales of Canadian spruce might have been made if such a concession had been offered.\nMR. SAMUEL R. WALKER touches on the banking crisis, and refers to the danger of some people being unable to bear the strain of their working capital being locked up. He chronicles some splendid rains which should benefit the producing industries. His report on prices is sorry reading.\nMESSRS. GEMMELL, TUCKETT, & Co. report a falling-off in the demand for all building materials, and do not anticipate any improvement for three or four months. Imports during the ensuing season will be very light, and this fact should have an improving tendency on values.\n\nGAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nBROWN & SON (John Austin Brown and Thomas John Brown), builders, 44, Thames Street, Woolwich.—The following are creditors in this deed of arrangement:—\n... ... ... £ s. d.\nDalton, Bournes, & Dolton, London ... 83 3 0\nFarmer & Gregory, Plumstead ... 29 9 8\nHodge & Co., London ... ... 28 2 0\nHollick & Co., London ... ... 10 17 5\nLloyd & Son, Woolwich ... ... 27 7 2\nMay & Sons, London ... ... 19 19 10\nSmeed, Dean, & Co., Sittingbourne ... 33 18 0\nWatson & Hiscox, Woolwich ... 109 1 1\nYoung & Marten, London ... ... 39 13 0\nCURNOW, JOHN, builder, Carnarvon Road and Moxon Street, Barnet.—At the Barnet County Court last week application was made to Judge Holl by Mr. Lee Roberts, counsel for the trustee in this matter, for the committal of the debtor for failure to comply with the orders of the Court from time to time. The facts of the case have been reported in our columns. It was alleged against the debtor that he had failed to furnish certain accounts and other particulars, which he said he was unable to do. The Judge ordered him to com-\n\nply with the orders of the Court within a week, failing which he said he would commit him. Further, he must pay the costs of the application.\nELLIS, J. W. & G. F. (John Walker Ellis and George Frederick Ellis), builders, 18, Ella Street, Leeds.—The following are among the creditors under this deed of arrangement:—\n... ... ... £ s. d.\nBarrett & Russell, Leeds ... ... 30 0 0\nCuthbert R., Leeds ... ... 62 14 0\nEllis Samuel, jun., Leeds ... ... 123 0 0\nSmith J. & H., Leeds ... ... 28 5 9\nStead Ezra, Leeds ... ... 70 0 0\nVine J.

Brougham, Official Receiver. The accounts, which had just been lodged, showed liabilities expected to rank £3,614, and estimated assets £1,799 11s. 3d. The chairman said that the debtor had submitted a scheme which provided for the payment of a composition of 9s. 6d. in the pound. It was for the creditors to determine whether having referred to the position of affairs as disclosed in the accounts they would accept the proposal which was made. The composition, however, was to be paid in cash on approval of the scheme by the court, and it was further provided that a cash creditor for £530 should stand aside until the other creditors had been satisfied. The business, the chairman added, had been carried on and brought in a small cash balance to the credit of the estate, after payment of £69 due for rent, in respect for which a distraint had been levied. A creditor asked how it was that a proposal previously made for the payment of 10s. 6d. in the pound had fallen through. Another creditor said he presided at the private meeting when that offer was put forward, and as it was not unanimously accepted the debtor filed his petition at the request of creditors. After further discussion the meeting was adjourned to August 1st in order that the scheme might be formulated and sent to the creditors. The following are the principal creditors, viz:—\n... ... ... £ s. d.\nBaron Brook Mrs., Forest Gate ... 530 0 0\nBroom & Co., Kidderminster ... 32 15 0\nCollins W.

Official Receiver's observations are:—The receiving order was made on the petition of the debtor. Orders of adjudication and summary administration have also been made. The bankrupt began business ten years ago. The unsecured indebtedness is almost exclusively in respect of goods supplied. The following are the creditors:—\n... ... ... £ s. d.\nBritten & Gilson, Southwark ... 36 0 0\nElliott, Son, & Co., Southampton ... 16 10 3\nForman T., Lambeth ... ... 19 14 1\nGosling T., Frinsham ... ... 20 0 0\nGriggs & Co., Loughborough... ... 20 0 0\nHart F., Farnham ... ... 32 1 7\nHunt St. John & Co., Pountney Hill, E.C. 80 8 10\nRIX, GEORGE, builder, Tasburgh, late Long Stratton.—This debtor was publicly examined at the last sitting of the Norwich Bankruptcy Court. He said he commenced business fifteen years ago without capital. The only book he had kept was a rough ledger. He made up his mind to file his petition about the beginning of June. The debtor was allowed to pass.\nSANFORD, HY., builder and contractor, Bromley.—The following are among the creditors herein:—\n... ... ... £ s. d.\nAldin & Co., Richmond ... ... 126 17 3\nAshton & Green, Limited, London... ... 51 0 11\nBaxter & Co., Bromley... ... ... 46 14 4\nBaynes & Beard, Reading ... ... 112 3 0\nBoardman & Co., Bromley ... ... 30 0 0\nChandler F.

The liabilities were returned at £759 9s. 2d., and it appeared that the assets had realised £144 16s. 6d., and yielded a first and final dividend of 1s. 11d. in the pound. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had traded after knowledge of insolvency. His Honour granted the discharge subject to a nominal suspension for three weeks.\nWALKER, HENRY, builder, 52, Pembroke Street, St. Clement's, Oxford.—Mr. Mallam, Official Receiver, has issued to the creditors particulars of this failure. The receiving order was made on the petition of the debtor himself, and he attributes his failure to \"taking contracts too large, and not having capital enough; loss on contracts.\" The liabilities are £1,399, and the assets £66, so that the deficiency is £1,333. The Official Receiver remarks that the debtor, who is 33 years of age, started in business in 1844 as a builder and contractor with £150, which he had saved. Four years later he executed a private deed of arrangement, paying 10s. in the pound. Recently he entered into a large contract for £2,500 at Thame, which he had only about half finished. At the end of May last he consulted his solicitor, and on June 7th a meeting of creditors was held. On June 20th the debtor executed a deed of assignment with Mr. T. H. Kingerlee, with a committee. No one executed the deed but himself, and Mr. Kingerlee began acting under it. Finding the alleged assets doubtful, Mr. Kingerlee and the committee suggested bankruptcy proceedings, which the debtor adopted. Four creditors had obtained judgment, but execution had not been issued.\nBANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.\nADAMS HENRY, builder, 28, Monson Colonnade, Tunbridge Wells.
