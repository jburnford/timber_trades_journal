P. Ferry, of Geneva, Switzerland, writing to an American contemporary, says:-\" Do you want to do a big thing for Puget Sound firs?\nThen hammer away on wood pavements.\nThe finest streets in the world are in Paris and London.\nThe finest streets in those cities are made of wood.\nIn Paris they are spending millions of dollars on wood pavements.\nSimply the old Nicholson American pavement perfected.\nI have had Puget Sound firs tried in Europe by experts on wood pavements.\nThey pronounce it the best wood they have ever seen for pavements.\nIs it not a shame that Puget Sound should send to California for bitumen for streets when she has such an abundance of material at home superior to all others?\nThe only material to be bought abroad is the cement, and that you must have with any good pavement.\nAfter years of writing I find one Tacoma is going to lay a wood pavement, but one which will prove a failure and injure Puget Sound firs in the east and on the continent for covered pavements.\nIf something new is not discovered, wood pavements will be universal in the east.\nOne first-class wood pavement will overcome much of the prejudice caused by the old defective pavement.\"\nPROVIDENT CLERKS' MUTUAL LIFE ASSURANCE ASSOCIATION.\n27, MOORGATE STREET, LONDON, E.C.\n(Established 1840.)\nFunds Invested ... £1,793,000\nClaims paid immediately on proof of death and title.\nReversionary Bonus declared, £1 10s. per cent per annum.\nJNO.
