LONDON CHAMBER OF ARBITRATION.-Acting on the suggestion of the Joint Committee of Management of the London Chamber of Arbitration, the Corporation have made certain additions and alterations of considerable practical importance to the rules and regulations of the Chamber.
A model clause for insertion in trade contracts, providing for the submission of disputes arising in connection with such contracts to the Chamber, having been settled by counsel approved by the joint committee, a new rule had been framed dealing with arbitrations referred to the Chamber under such clause.
A new rule was also found necessary for dealing with references to the Chamber from the High Court.
PUGET SOUND FIR.-Mr. C. P. Ferry, of Geneva, Switzerland, writing to an American contemporary, says:-" Do you want to do a big thing for Puget Sound firs?
Then hammer away on wood pavements.
The finest streets in the world are in Paris and London.
The finest streets in those cities are made of wood.
In Paris they are spending millions of dollars on wood pavements.
Simply the old Nicholson American pavement perfected.
I have had Puget Sound firs tried in Europe by experts on wood pavements.
They pronounce it the best wood they have ever seen for pavements.
Is it not a shame that Puget Sound should send to California for bitumen for streets when she has such an abundance of material at home superior to all others?
The only material to be bought abroad is the cement, and that you must have with any good pavement.
After years of writing I find one Tacoma is going to lay a wood pavement, but one which will prove a failure and injure Puget Sound firs in the east and on the continent for covered pavements.
If something new is not discovered, wood pavements will be universal in the east.
One first-class wood pavement will overcome much of the prejudice caused by the old defective pavement."
