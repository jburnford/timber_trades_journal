THE ABERDEEN CATTLE SHOW.
ONE of the most interesting exhibits on the show-ground at Aberdeen recently was to be found on Stand No. 50. There Messrs. Reid & Leys had a new oil engine brought out by Messrs. Crossley Brothers, Limited, Openshaw, Manchester, the well-known makers of the "Crossley" Otto gas engine. Messrs. Crossley have built this engine on the general lines of their gas engine. It is of 4 horse-power nom., indicating 8 1/2 horse-power, and giving 6 1/2 actual or brake horse-power. In the sole of the engine there is a tank capable of holding 10 gallons of oil. From this tank the oil is pumped up into the vaporiser and another small tank for supplying a lamp, the function of which is to keep the vaporiser and ignition tube hot. The oil on coming into the vaporiser is converted into gas, which passes into the cylinder. It is there mixed with a certain proportion of air, then compressed by the piston, and fired by the ignition tube. The great feature of the engine is its simplicity and cheapness of working. It can be driven for a consumption of oil equal to three-quarters of a pint per brake per hour. The consumption of the oil is controlled by a patent inertia governor, which regulates the consumption according to the actual power being taken out of the engine. In working a full load with oil costing 6d. a gallon, the expense would be between 3d. and 4d. per hour. The cost of oil for carrying oil, as compared with coal, is about 1 to 16, so there is no doubt, considering all these advantages, that this is the motive power for a farm-steading or any place where ordinary coal gas is not available. Mr. John T. Clark, 46, Rose Street, Aberdeen, coachmaker to the Queen, showed a selection of carriages, in which several new features were introduced. Mr. Clark's exhibits have been features of the show for successive years, and his display on this occasion was fully up to his former high standard. Messrs. David Gray & Son, Holburn Street, Aberdeen, at their stand exhibited a variety of carts, wheels, and axles, which were well worthy of the attention of farmers. Messrs. R. & J. Shinnie, Union Row, Aberdeen, the well-known carriage builders, had a collection of machines of superior manufacture. The stand was a covered one, occupied a prominent position in the implement yard; and, as in former years at the Royal Northern Show, the collection of county gentlemen and agriculturalists' vehicles attracted the attention of tourists. The firm exhibited the most recent specimens of their manufacture, including a number of patent improvements; and, alike in design and workmanship, they more than maintained their previous wide reputation.

YELLOW FIR.--The question of when the North European red and white fir should be felled, to be of the best quality, has for a long time been a subject of conjecture, without agreement among experts. A society in Westphalia has, we observe, been recently carrying out a series of experiments with a view of clearing up this point, which should be one of practical importance.

THE ISLAND OF ARRAN AS A FIELD FOR PLANTING.
By W. A. MACKENZIE, Strabane, Isle of Arran.
(Continued from Page 7.)
AMONG the other trees that may be mentioned the elm, the mountain ash, and poplar. All specimens of these trees are diminutive, and hardly worth notice. Those trees of the same kind that have been planted, however, go to prove that cultivation would be a success if properly practised.
It might be interesting to mention a few of the rarer exotic trees that are to be found growing at present on the island. Of these, perhaps the most worthy is the "Blue Gum" tree, or Eucalyptus globulus. Two fine specimens are growing in favoured situations on the island, growing at the back of Craigard House. They were originally planted some twenty years ago. The larger is now about 30 feet high. This tree was unfortunately much damaged by the heavy gale last October. By the instructions of Captain Brown it was pruned very carefully, and may yet get over it, for the misfortune. Several other young Eucalyptus are growing at Strabane, the Corrie ones came from those at Lamlash. At Strabane there are two of the Australian Wattle trees, or dal[?]artica, with several other kinds of acacias, all in a thriving condition. The fuchsia grows very abundantly all around Brodick Castle, and is found in quantity in other places. At Strabane there is a laburnum on which mistletoe is flourishing.
From these facts, and from the delicate constitution of the trees already mentioned, it is not difficult to infer that the climate of Arran is a mild one, and in every way favourable to the growth of trees and shrubs. While it is true that natives of a warm climate grow with such luxuriance in the island, some of the hardier timber trees, which thrive in a more ungenial climate than Britain, do not grow with great profusion. To give further proof of this, I will describe in detail the present plantations on the island.
1. The Merkland plantation, immediately to the back of Brodick Castle, is by far the largest plantation on the island. It covers nearly 500 acres, and is from seventy-five years old.
