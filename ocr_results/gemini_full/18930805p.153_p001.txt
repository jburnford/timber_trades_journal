FUNERAL OF MR. JOHN BAYLY.
The funeral of Mr. John Bayly took place on Thursday, the 27th ult., when the remains of the deceased gentleman were conveyed to Plymouth.
It having been the express wish of the family that everything connected with the funeral should be carried out in the most simple and private manner, every precaution was taken by his relatives to comply with the wishes of the deceased in this respect.
Nothing could have been more in perfect accord with the wishes of the deceased than the quiet yet impressive procession at the little moorland parish.
The cortege consisted of twelve carriages, conveying members of the family, the leading inhabitants at Plymouth, the domestic servants, and the bearers, selected from the workmen at the works, both at Plymouth and Yelverton.
On reaching Sheepstor, the occupants of the carriages alighted at the lychyard gates, and followed the coffin, which was carried by hand to the church.
At the gate the procession was met by the Rev. Prebendary Hayne, of Buckland Monachorum, and the Rev. C. H. Crook, vicar of Sheepstor.
The coffin—a shell enclosed in polished oak—was covered with moss in which flowers were embedded.
The arrangements were most satisfactorily carried out.
The Mayor of Plymouth (Mr. W. Law) joined the funeral procession in his private carriage at Seven Trees, the chief mourners being Mr. J. Ellis, Town Clerk, and Mr. T. Brook, of the firm of Messrs. Harvey Daw and Mr. T. Brook, of the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce, of which body the late Mr. Bayly was chairman.

A SUBSTITUTE FOR MOULDINGS.—
It is not known, says Furniture and Decoration, that new manilla rope will make beautiful and economical spiral mouldings for woodwork, which may be used as spiral mouldings in circular or any other curved work where wooden mouldings could not be employed without incurring extraordinary expense.
The cost of rope will not probably amount to half the price of spiral wood mouldings of the same size.
The rope should be soaked for a few hours in thin starch and water, in equal parts thoroughly mixed together.
When soft the rope is to be nailed in place, take a piece of the vessels in which it has been placed and wipe off all the adhesive matter; then take one end with a brad or two and twist the rope until the spiral strands appear more prominent than when a rope is not twisted.
After the moulding ropes are secured where they are to remain, take a three-square piece of timber, dressed off like in the cross section, and draw the stick firmly in order to press between the strands of the rope, in order that the moulding may be finished with wood, and painted and varnished.
