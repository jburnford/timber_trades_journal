In acknowledging this toast, he said he thought the progress of Johore would compare favourably with other places. The export of gambier and pepper, tin and timber was likely to increase, and he hoped that the Singapore merchants would as usual get all the produce of Johore at a reasonable figure. It looked a very short space of time since he came there, and he well remembered the days when Mr. Paterson and Mr. Simons used to come over with friends to see the saw-mills, which had contributed in some degree to the advancement and profit of Johore. En passant he remarked that one friend suggested Pangaran as a good site for a saw-mill, another thought that Batu Pahat was a beautiful place for such a concern, but it was to the sagacity of H H the Sultan, who recommended and gave the site for the Johore steam saw-mills at Tanjong Putri. Mr H M Simons congratulated Messrs Fraser & C'umming on having leased the Johore saw-mills and wished them success. Mr. John Fraser said that perhaps it was premature to speak of having leased the saw-mills, as it would not be until July 21st that his firm would enter into possession. Datu Meldrum would then be seventy-two years of age, and he would keep them in his own hands until that day.\n\nPROVIDENT CLERKS' MUTUAL LIFE ASSURANCE ASSOCIATION.\n27, MOORGATE STREET, LONDON, E.C.\n(Established 1840.)\nFunds Invested ... £1,726,900\nInterim Bonuses Paid\nClaims paid immediately on proof of death and title.\nValuation 1892 Surplus, £201,316.\nOf reversionary Bonus declared, £1 12s. per cent. per ann.\nJNO.
