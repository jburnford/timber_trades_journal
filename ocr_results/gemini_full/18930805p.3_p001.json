Those arrivals are pretty well divided among the various importers, the firewood cargo being for Messrs. Forslind & Rex. There have also just come into dock the Czar (s), from Cronstadt, the Penelope (s), from Archangel, and the Southern Queen, from Quebec. The two former vessels are only partially wood-laden, but the Southern Queen brings an entire cargo of Quebec timber for Messrs. Garland & Roger.\nTrade has begun to move along after the holidays, but there has been scarcely time yet to get into full swing, some of the mills and yards not being open until Wednesday.\nGLASGOW TIMBER MARKET.\nThere was a better attendance this week and a cheerful feeling pervaded the trade; there is no approach to any marked activity, but a very healthy condition of business was experienced. The holiday season has been got over for the present, and there is a general disposition to order more freely. Buyers and consumers have come to realise that no object is to be gained by holding off placing both current and probable require-ments in the hope of a weakening timber market, the prospects pointing to an opposite tendency are very long.\n\nAUGUST 5, 1893.\nThe Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\nThe moderate supplies are preventing stocks being augmented as they usually are by this time of the year.
