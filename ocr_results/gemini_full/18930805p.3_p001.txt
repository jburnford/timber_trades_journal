some lively bidding; but as a great part of the cargo consisted of smaller wood, which it appeared was little wanted, considerable difficulty was experienced in placing these lots.

LEITH.
Since last week, the following arrivals are reported, viz, the Vistula (s), from Libau, with 209 pieces oak; the Abana (s), from New-York, with 5,200 staves; the Petersburg (s), from Cronstadt, with 33,765 deals and battens, and 16½ fathoms firewood; the Camtoos, from Helsingfors, with 76 fathoms firewood; the Alma (s), from Baltimore, with 77 poplar logs, 22 oak logs, 87 hickory logs, and 8 walnut logs. Those arrivals are pretty well divided among the various importers, the firewood cargo being for Messrs. Forslind & Rex. There have also just come into dock the Czar (s), from Cronstadt, the Penelope (s), from Archangel, and the Southern Queen, from Quebec. The two former vessels are only partially wood-laden, but the Southern Queen brings an entire cargo of Quebec timber for Messrs. Garland & Roger.
Trade has begun to move along after the holidays, but there has been scarcely time yet to get into full swing, some of the mills and yards not being open until Wednesday.
GLASGOW TIMBER MARKET.
There was a better attendance this week and a cheerful feeling pervaded the trade; there is no approach to any marked activity, but a very healthy condition of business was experienced. The holiday season has been got over for the present, and there is a general disposition to order more freely. Buyers and consumers have come to realise that no object is to be gained by holding off placing both current and probable require-ments in the hope of a weakening timber market, the prospects pointing to an opposite tendency are very long.
