ANDREW STREET, EDINBURGH.\nTelegraphic Address—\"THOMSON, EDINBURGH.\"\n\nOPPOSITION TO IMPORTED MACHINE-MADE BARRELS.\nThe steamer *Dagmar*, loaded with Swedish machine-made barrels, which arrived at Peterhead on Tuesday, was the cause of an exciting scene at the harbour. The Fraserburgh coopers having refused entrance to the vessel there, she went to Peterhead. The coopers at the latter town met and resolved not to handle the barrels, and to strike if they were forcibly landed. Someone suggested that the *Dagmar* should be put out of the harbour, and this idea was received with acclamation. The coopers rushed along the quays, swarmed over the fishing boats which surrounded the steamer, and took possession of her. They then cut the mooring ropes, attached a cable to her stern, and commenced to drag her along the harbour through the boats which blocked the way, crushing them together and damaging them. The harbourmaster finally cut the cable, and the rope was thrown from the *Dagmar* to the steamer *Bernadotte*. Captain Hiorth, of the latter vessel, seized it, and attempted to fix it, but the coopers invaded his ship, threw him down, and used him roughly. The *Dagmar's* anchor was then let go in the harbour, and steam being up, the vessel was able to successfully resist the coopers' efforts to heave her out. Then they desisted, seeing the impossibility of getting the vessel out until the harbour was clear. The police were present, but they were powerless against the number of men. About 3,000 people were attracted to the scene.\nThis dispute was reported to have been settled just before we went to press. After the procession of the men had visited the fish-curing yards, the men gathered on the quays around the steamer *Dagmar*, to the number of several thousand, when an intimation was received that the agents for the consignors of the barrels had agreed to pay the freights, and the vessel would leave at high water. Upon this a large number of the coopers returned to work, but many waited to see the vessel leave the harbour. The excitement then cooled down. Later in the day the piers were again crowded with people to see the vessels go, and enthusiastic cheering as they left the harbour. The magistrates resolved to notify parties in charge of the cargo to give notice to the police authorities, so that the necessary protection could be obtained for discharging the cargo; but this action was rendered unnecessary by the vessels leaving. The coopers endeavoured to get a guarantee that the barrels should not be landed anywhere in Scotland, but in this they were unsuccessful.\n\nFORTHCOMING AUCTION SALES.\nLEITH D. W.
