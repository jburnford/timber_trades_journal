FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
EDWARDS, H., builder, 32, Beversbrook-road, Tufnell Park, N.—A sitting for the bankrupt's public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hope. The case has been already reported in the Timber Trades Journal, and the accounts show liabilities £1,865 9s. 6d., with assets nil. The bankrupt, having been examined by the Official Receiver as to his building operations, and the causes of his failure, was allowed to pass.
GLEVES, JOHN, builder, 11, Gipsy Hill, West Norwood, S.E.—This bankrupt appeared last week before Mr. Registrar Hope to pass his public examination, his statement of affairs showing total liabilities £11,821 15s. 11d. and an estimated deficiency of £642 15s. 11d. In the course of his examination by the Official Receiver the bankrupt stated that he had during the last fourteen years been engaged in building operations, part of them being purely of a speculative character. At first he was in partnership with another person, and whilst so trading a composition of 5s. in the pound was accepted by the creditors. In 1887 the partner retired, he (Gleves) paying him £100 and taking over the business as it stood. He attributed his failure to depreciation in the value of his properties, and to having signed accommodation bills for other persons without receiving any consideration. The Registrar ordered the examination to be concluded.
GREENWOOD, PAUL, saw-mill proprietor and late timber merchant, Curtain Road, Shoreditch, and Church Row, Bethnal Green.—The debtor attended for his public examination last week before Mr. Registrar Hope. The gross liabilities were returned at £5,883 6s. 5d., of which £3,674 7s. 8d. are expected to rank, and assets estimated at £1,799 1s. 3d. Upon examination by Mr. H. Brougham, Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he commenced business in 1875 with a capital of £2,000 as a timber merchant and upholsterers' warehouseman, in Curtain Road. The timber merchant's business was relinquished about twelve months ago. He thought at the beginning of the present year that he would be unable to pay current accounts, and offered his creditors a composition of 10s. 6d. in the pound, but the arrangement fell through. Under the bankruptcy proceedings which followed a composition of 9s. 6d. in the pound had been accepted, payable forthwith. He attributed his failure to bad debts, to the expenses having exceeded the profits, and to defalcations by a clerk. Three years ago he had a capital in hand of £1,200, which had altogether disappeared, and had been replaced by his present deficiency. It was therefore apparent that the business had yielded no profit during the past two years, but he nevertheless continued to trade and incur liabilities. Since 1883 he had been proprietor of saw-mills in Curtain Road, Shoreditch, and Church Row, Bethnal Green. In 1882 he effected a composition arrangement with his creditors, but, with that exception, had not failed before. His Honour allowed the debtor to pass his examination.
HOWARD, GEORGE, builder, 52 and 53, King Street, Brighton, Sussex.—The summary of debtor's statement of affairs shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £290 4s. 3d., partly secured creditors £326 1s. 7d, creditors for rent, rates, &c., £62 9s. 1d., total £678 14s. 7d., of which £385 11s. 10d. is expected to rank, and assets £168 5s. 5d., deficiency £217 6s. 5d. Alleged cause of failure:—"Bad debts and high rate of interest." The Official Receiver's observations are:—The receiving order was made on the 17th day of July, and on the same day the debtor was adjudicated bankrupt. For the past twenty-five years the bankrupt has been carrying on the trade of a builder. The following are the creditors:—

WILKS, BENJAMIN, furniture dealer.—The debtor filed his petition on July 11th in the Swansea County Court, and the first meeting of creditors was held at the London Bankruptcy Court on Friday, before Mr. T. W. Hancock, deputy receiver for Swansea. A statement of affairs was furnished showing unsecured debts £2,350 0s. 2d., and debts fully secured £1,765; against assets £1,717 3s., of which £1,253 consists of an estimated surplus from mortgaged property. The debtor states that he commenced business as a furniture dealer and builder between nine and ten years ago with a capital of about £30. In 1891 he also carried on business as an auctioneer. He has not kept proper books of account. He attributes his insolvency to depression in trade, bad debts, and loss through building speculations. The debtor, in reply to questions, said that he first became aware of his insolvency early in June, on being unable to meet a bill for £25. So far as he remembered he had not after he ascertained his position incurred any fresh debts. He made no proposal, and it appeared that he had already been adjudged bankrupt. Mr. J. F. Harroby, accountant, Swansea, was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection.

HOME GROWN TIMBER.
TRADE IN SOMERSET.
The home-grown timber trade is reported to be in a very indifferent condition, especially in the northern part of the county, where it is worse than for several years past. Oak timber is cheap, and there is little or no demand for realised. Ash is scarce, and good prices could be obtained. Elm is in moderate demand at prices usually obtained.
FORESTRY IN IRELAND.
Forest operations in Ireland have always fluctuated. Previous to the year 1791 there were 102,000 acres under trees. After that date, however, the land so utilised seems to have rapidly increased in area, 26,000 acres having been planted in 1791-1800, and more and more in every decennial period, until, by the census of 1840, no less than 345,000 acres were devoted to oak, ash, elm, beech, fir, and mixed woods, or over 36,000 acres more than at the present moment. Then came the famine years, and tree planting was not only itself at a stand-still, but the existing woods had to be cut down. This went on to the year 1851, when the afforested acreage rose from 306,000 to 313,000, and, with a few exceptions, continued to rise until 1888, when it again sank, until this year the tree crop of the Emerald Isle is much less than it was a few years ago, being recorded at 309,586 acres. No country has a climate better suited for tree growing than the moist valleys of Ireland, where the soil is often quite unfitted for grain or root crops. Unfortunately, afforestation is not an enterprise for poor men or for little farmers. The rich man can indulge in it on a large scale; but, for a very obvious reason, the poor cultivator regards an acre under trees as an acre out of cultivation.
STATE CONTROL OVER FORESTS.
No sooner did Prussia, Saxony, Saxe-Weimar, Anhalt, Hanover, Oldenburg, Schleswig-Holstein, and other German States abandon all control over private forests than the private forests began to disappear. North Germany became bare, and the fir-covered mountains stretching to the Baltic were converted into desolate heaths. By 1846 scarcely an oak was left in Mecklenburg, and the high grounds of Schleswig-Holstein, which up to 1811 were covered with birchwoods and oak coppices, are now barren. To remedy this result of mistaken theory, Prussia had actually to buy great tracts of land to replant the woods they destroyed out of private greed. Ireland has had an experience of the same character, though not on the same scale.
FORTHCOMING SALE.
The Marquis of Ormonde has instructed Messrs. R. Waterman & Sons, 20, Week Street, Maidstone, to conduct a sale of oak timber on the Ulcomb Estate, Kent, on Friday, the 25th inst.
