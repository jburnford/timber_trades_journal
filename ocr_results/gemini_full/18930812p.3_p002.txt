ROYAL SCOTTISH ARBORICULTURAL SOCIETY.
THE fortieth annual general meeting of the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society was held in the Bible Society's Rooms, St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh. Professor Bayley Balfour, president of the society, occupied the chair, and eighty-five new members were elected.
The following office-bearers were elected for the ensuing year :—President, Professor Bayley Balfour ; vice-presidents, Dr. Cleghorn and Mr. W. M. Welsh, nurseryman and seedsman, Edinburgh ; Mr. Robert Lindsay, curator of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh ; Mr. John Methven, nurseryman, Edinburgh ; and Mr. D. F. Mackenzie, factor, Mortonhall ; Council—Mr. Charles Buchanan, overseer, Penicuik ; Mr. James Cook, land steward, Arniston ; Mr. Robert Hutchison, Edinburgh ; Mr. James Kay, forester, Rothesay ; Mr. James Moffat, assistant factor, Edinburgh ; Mr. Lewis Bayne, Scone ; Mr. Malcolm Dunn, Dalkeith Palace Gardeus ; Mr. D. P. Laird, nurseryman, Murrayfield ; Mr. R. C. Munro Ferguson, M.P. ; Mr. Andrew Slater, overseer, Haystoun ; Colonel Bailey, R.E., Lecturer on Forestry, Edinburgh University ; Mr. Robert Baxter, forester, Dalkeith ; Mr. Alexander Milne, nurseryman and seedsman, Edinburgh ; Mr. James Robertson, wood manager, Panmure ; and Dr. William Somerville, Professor of Agriculture and Forestry, Durham College, Newcastle ; secretary and treasurer, Mr. W. J. Moffat, Edinburgh ; auditor, Mr. J. O. Mackenzie, of Dolphinton, W.S.
The President, in his address, congratulated the members on the prosperous state of the society. In the matter of the accession of new members the present was a record year, and the society now numbered 660 ; and they had further evidence of its prosperity and influence in the success which attended their efforts to promote the cause of forestry in this country. In this connection he reminded them that Colonel Bailey, in his introductory lecture to the University forestry class last year, had referred to the fact that in specifications issued by the Board of Agriculture, with reference to works to be executed under the Lands Improvements Act, the use of home-grown timber was prohibited. This restriction had been discussed, and the society had, through Mr. Munro Ferguson, entered into communication with the Board of Agriculture. The result had been that the protest of the society had had effect, and the objectionable prohibition respecting home-grown timber had been removed for Scotland so far as concerned work under the control of the Board of Agriculture—an eloquent tribute to the usefulness of the society as representing the voice of forestry interests in Scotland. Their clear duty now was to follow up what they had already done by a vigorous inquiry into the forms of contracts insisted upon by all other departments which made specifications involving the use of timber, so that they might altogether remove the stigma which had become attached to home products. The President referred, in passing, to the Forestry Exhibition at Earl's Court—an undertaking from which he personally did not see that much credit could redound to the society which had given its patronage, nor advantage to forestry.
