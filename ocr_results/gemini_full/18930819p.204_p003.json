The assets are returned at £166, less £7 1s. 6d. for claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaving net assets at £158 18s. 6d., and showing a deficit of £777 19s. 11d. The debtor attributes his failure to underestimating contracts, and sickness of self and wife. The receiving order was made on debtor's own petition. He commenced business in 1887 with a capital of £50, and as long as he continued a jobbing builder he did well and paid his way. He then began to tender for contracts, and until the beginning of 1892 he made no loss; during that year, however, he took three contracts amounting together to over £1,000, on which he estimates he made a loss of about £800. He became aware of his insolvency in June, 1892, and has incurred fresh debts since then of between £300 and £400, hoping to pay some out of the contracts he had in hand. No cash-book or bought ledger has been kept by the debtor, and he has never prepared a statement of affairs. The first meeting of the creditors interested hereunder was held on Monday at the offices of the Official Receiver, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E., but, as there was not a quorum of creditors present, no resolutions could be passed. Therefore the estate will be wound up by the Official Receiver.\nBURT, FREDERICK, 2, Stockfield road, Streatham, builder.-The Official Receiver for the Wandsworth district has issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the unsecured creditors amount to £322 7s. 8d., and assets to £1 15s., this leaving a deficiency of £320 11s. 8d. The debtor alleges his failure to have been caused through law costs and loss on the sale of houses. The report and observations of the Official Receiver are to the following effect:-The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition, and he has been adjudicated bankrupt. The debtor commenced business in February, 1892, with a capital of £90. He had failed in 1878. The debtor states that he first became aware of his insolvency about six months ago, and that since then he has incurred no further liabilities. He has been ordered to file a cash and goods account for the last two years.\nEAST, GEORGE, timber merchant, West Dean, near Salisbury; and Winchester.

E. & Sons, Winchester 31 11 9\nHUNT, EDWARD, builder, Hull.-At the Hull Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Rollitt, this debtor came up for public examination. He admitted that he had signed an account for the monies due from him in respect of some mortgages, amounting in the aggregate to £4,327, but he did not owe any money from the party in question at various",
