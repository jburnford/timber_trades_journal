SCOTTISH YEAR BOOK.—Messrs. Robert Reid & Sons, timber merchants of Forth Saw-mills, and Ladybank, own the Ladybank saw-mills. The entry describing Mr. Forrest as proprietor in the Scottish Timber Trades Year Book for 1893 is an error.
PROPOSED NEW RAILWAY.—A new railway is projected at a cost of £12,000,000. It will start from Manchester and proceed via Burnley, thence on the low side of Nelson to Barnoldswick, Elslack, Broughton, Gargrave, Threshfield, Kettlewell, Leyburn, Richmond, Darlington, Bishop Auckland, Newcastle, Howick, Carstairs, and to Glasgow. The route is intended to be a through express one, and in the more populous parts of the district four pairs of rails are to be laid. The promoters are trying to construct the railway without any steep gradient or sharp curves. Between Manchester and Newcastle the projected line will shorten the present distance by over twenty miles, and between Newcastle and Glasgow the distance will be reduced forty miles.
MR. ALEX. MACKELLAR.
The subject of our portrait is Mr. Alex. Mackellar, late of the firm of J. & A. Mackellar, Glasgow, and who, on retiring from that firm, has for many years been associated with the timber trade of that city. He came from Tighnabruaich, in the West Highlands, where he was born, and where his circumstances, and what may be termed his cultural pursuits pointed to his remaining. He was, however, induced by a friend to engage in the mercantile life of Glasgow, incident to an early age. The commercial community of Glasgow, and entered the late well-known firm of Brownlie & Co., where he continued for eight years. His natural aptitude quickly asserted itself, and was recognised by the late Mr. Brownlie, their yard foreman. The practical part of the working of the timber trade he acquired in a few years' experience, and he joined another Glasgow firm, with the view of commencing business on his own account, which he did in 1884, with his brother, under the firm of J. & A. Mackellar. They began business in a small way, and, after eight years' hard work, built up their woodyard there, and also erected the Central Saw-mill, which the firm at present occupies. After having so well attended their business for all these years, after these years of work, Mr. Mackellar acquired that competency which enabled him to retire from business, and he now removes to his proper sphere of life, where he may enjoy what he has so well earned, and fulfilled the ambition of his early life.
