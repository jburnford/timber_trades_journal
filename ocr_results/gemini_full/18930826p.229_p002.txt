DOCK FIRES IN LIVERPOOL.
It has long been a matter of surprise, regret (says the Shipping Gazette), that the Liverpool pool should possess so evil a pre-eminence for frequent and destructive dock fires. By the regulations of the Mersey Dock estate, it is provided that those interested shall provide watchmen to guard their goods while they lie on the quays or in the sheds. These watchmen do good service in checking pilfering, but in the opinion of the Works, as well as the Traffic and Quays Committee of the Mersey Docks Board that they are responsible to a great extent for the dock fires. It is alleged that they are guilty of acts of indiscretion that they connive at the misconduct of men who may have leanings in that direction, or who employ their addiction to tobacco under conditions on duty that is supposed to be the cause of much mischief. Assuming that a watchman has the habit of smoking during his nightly rounds, it is perfectly easy to see that sooner or later he may produce a fire. It is easy for a man snugly ensconced in some quiet corner, amid surroundings of cotton bales, or other equally inflammable, enjoying the luxury of the forbidden pipe. Should he ever, he hears the heavy tread of the policeman, and to avoid detection the pipe, with its smouldering contents, is thrust into the nearest hiding-place that offers. That destructive fires have been produced in this way there can be no doubt. It is suggested that in future the dock watchmen shall be taken by police, and that a more stricter discipline and readier means of punishment will doubtless discharge the duties of the men, if not with greater efficiency.
Timber Merchants and others may be supplied with red and blue Marking Chalk, best quality, at 6s. per lb (free). Postal orders or cheque to Mr. R. J. PEART, and crossed "London and Westminster Bank, Bloomsbury Branch." Cheques and bills, London.-[Advt.]
