(Benjamin Hastings), timber merchant, 28, Medlock Street, Hulme, and 31, Ackers Street, Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester.—Under this deed of arrangement the following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nBennett J.

J. Perkins, Registrar, was present, and also Mr. Alex. Mackintosh, senior, Official Receiver, but for some reason or other the bankrupt did not attend.\nThe Official Receiver said he thought an error must have been made, and the Registrar agreed to adjourn the examination until the October Court, but said some serious notice would be taken of the matter if the bankrupt did not then appear.\n\nRICHMONI & GRAVESON, Clifton Street, Finsbury, E.C.—These traders are said to be in difficulties.\nAmong the creditors are :—\n£ s. d.\nBrowning & Co. ... ... ... ... 830 0 0\nBamberger L. ... ... ... ... 725 0 0\nMoore W. ... ... ... ... 285 0 0\nRaymond J.

A. Pope, Assistant Receiver.\nThe accounts furnished by the debtor show gross liabilities £981 4s. 9d., of which £822 1s. 2d. are expected to rank, against assets expected to produce £540.\nThe statement of affairs was not lodged by the debtor in time to allow the usual summary and observations to be sent to the creditors previous to the meeting, but the Chairman announced that they would be circulated in the course of a few days.\nIn reply to the Chairman the debtor said he had no offer to submit.\nOn behalf of creditors it was intimated that all questions would be reserved until the sitting for public examination, appointed for September 19th next, and resolutions were passed to wind up the estate in bankruptcy, with Mr. W. Hurt (Paul Boulton & Co.), 110, Cannon Street, E.C., acting as trustee, assisted by the following committee of inspection, viz.: Mr. Odell (Odell & Son), Mr. J. Lock and Mr. Seymour jun.
