DOCK FIRES IN LIVERPOOL.
It has long been a matter for wonder and regret (says the *Shipping Gazette*) that Liverpool should possess so evil a reputation for frequent and destructive dock and warehouse fires.
By the regulations of the Mersey Dock estate, it is insisted that those interested shall provide watchmen to guard their goods while they lie upon the quays or in the sheds.
These watchmen may do good service in checking pilfering, but it is the opinion of the Works, as well as of the Docks and Quays Committee of the Mersey Dock Board that they are responsible to a great extent for the dock fires, that they are guilty of acts of incendiarism, or that they connive at the misdoings of those who may have leanings in that direction; it is simply their addiction to tobacco smoking when on duty that is supposed to be the cause of the mischief.
Assuming that a watchman is in the habit of smoking during his nightly vigil, it is perfectly easy to see that he may produce a fire.
It is easy to picture him snugly ensconced in some quiet corner among surroundings of cotton bales, or other goods equally inflammable, enjoying to the full the luxury of the forbidden pipe.
Suddenly, however, he hears the heavy tread of the policeman, and to avoid detection the pipe, with its smouldering contents, is thrust into the readiest hiding-place that offers.
That dock fires have been produced in this way there is no doubt.
It is suggested that in future the place of the watchmen shall be taken by the police, who, being under stricter discipline and readier supervision, will doubtless discharge the duties of watchmen, if not with greater efficiency, at least with less risk.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[*It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.*]

BRIGG, JOHN, builder and contractor, Bingley, Yorks.—The Official Receiver for the Bradford district has issued particulars under this failure.
The gross liabilities amount to £10,757 15s. 2d., of which £526 10s. 2d. is due to unsecured creditors, and to fully-secured creditors £6,011; the value of the securities being estimated at £10,381, thus leaving a balance of £4,370, of which £1,370 was due to another account; and the balance, £3,000, is expected to rank as an asset.
The partly-secured creditors amount to £4,220, the value of the securities being estimated at £222 11s. 4d., and £3,000, the estimated surplus from securities in the hands of fully-secured creditors.
The debtor estimates that he has a surplus of £2,696 1s. 2d. over his liabilities, but the existence of this surplus depends entirely upon the settlement of disputes between himself and Mr. Samuel Wright, solicitor, Bradford, on the one hand, and the Yeadon Waterworks Company on the other.
He has been adjudicated bankrupt, and does not intend to make any offer to his creditors.
Summary administration has been applied for in consequence of the debtor having stated that practically he had no estate.
The first meeting of creditors was held on Friday last, when it was decided to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver, but the meeting was of opinion that the debtor would pay 20s. in the pound.

CHEETHAM, JAMES EDWARD AND SAMUEL, trading as Cheetham Brothers, builders, Highfield Saw-mills, Bolton Road, Irlams-o'-th'-Height.—A meeting of the creditors of these debtors was held on Wednesday at the offices of the Official Receiver, Manchester.
A statement of the bankrupts' affairs showed liabilities amounting to £940, and assets amounting to £155.
The Official Receiver, in his printed statement to the creditors, stated that when the bankrupts took over their father's business the liabilities, according to their account, exceeded the value of the assets by £122.
The bankrupts gave as the causes of their failure the fact that the business was insolvent when they took it over, that they had had losses on contracts, and that trade had been bad.
The meeting decided to leave the realisation of the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver.

COBB, WILLIAM, builder and contractor, Dorchester.—The statutory meeting of creditors interested herein was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Oxford, last week.
The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £522 4s. 1d., of which £452 14s. 4d. was due to unsecured creditors, and the deficiency amounted to £348 19s. 4d.
The Official Receiver said he had obtained an order for summary administration, and the debtor had been adjudged bankrupt.
The estate was left in the hands of the Official Receiver.

HOWARD, GEORGE, builder, 52, King Street, Brighton.—The public examination of this bankrupt came on for hearing on Thursday week at the Brighton Bankruptcy Court before the Registrar.
The summary of accounts showed gross liabilities amounting to £678 14s. 11d., of which £386 11s. 10d. was due to unsecured creditors.
The assets were returned at £217 6s. 5d., thus leaving a deficit of £168 5s. 5d.
The debtor said he had been in business 25 years in Brighton as a builder.
He was successful for a number of years, but in 1880 he got into difficulties and filed his petition.
Under that failure a dividend of about 8s. in the pound was paid.
In 1889 he again filed his petition, when he owed about £400, and a dividend of 10s. in the pound was paid.
The examination was finally closed.

JONES, JAMES, builder, 38, Commercial Street, Mountain Ash.—The summary of the debtor's statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £579 7s. 8d., and assets £15 18s. 5d., deficiency £563 9s. 3d.

KNUDSEN BROS. & CO., timber merchants, 25, Wormwood Street, E.C.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Brougham on Wednesday, and, upon the application of Messrs Munns & Longden, a receiving order was made under a petition presented against Conway, in the county of Carnarvon.
The act of bankruptcy alleged was the non-compliance by the debtors with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice.

MOSS, WILLIAM, builder and contractor, Water Orton.—A meeting of the creditors of this bankrupt was held yesterday week at the offices of the Birmingham Official Receiver.
The statement of affairs showed the liabilities to be £422 5s. 8d., and the net assets £95 2s. 7d., leaving a deficiency of £327 3s. 1d.
The bankrupt commenced business at Coleshill in 1880, but was unsuccessful.
He started again a few years afterwards, but had several losses, and his insolvency was attributed to losses on contracts.
The case was a summary one, and the Official Receiver became the trustee.

GARRATT, JAMES, builder, Farnham.—This bankrupt should have attended at Guildford Bankruptcy Court last week for his public examination.
Mr. W. J. Perkins, Registrar, was present, and also Mr. Alex. Mackintosh, senior, Official Receiver, but for some reason or other the bankrupt did not attend.
The Official Receiver said he thought an error must have been made, and the Registrar agreed to adjourn the examination until the October Court, but said some serious notice would be taken of the matter if the bankrupt did not then appear.

RICHMONI & GRAVESON, Clifton Street, Finsbury, E.C.—These traders are said to be in difficulties.

WILKINS, WILLIAM H[?]NRY, builder, 2, Union Road, Clapham.—Under the failure of this debtor the first meeting of creditors was held at the London Bankruptcy Buildings last Monday, before Mr. C. A. Pope, Assistant Receiver.
The accounts furnished by the debtor show gross liabilities £981 4s. 9d., of which £822 1s. 2d. are expected to rank, against assets expected to produce £540.
The statement of affairs was not lodged by the debtor in time to allow the usual summary and observations to be sent to the creditors previous to the meeting, but the Chairman announced that they would be circulated in the course of a few days.
In reply to the Chairman the debtor said he had no offer to submit.
On behalf of creditors it was intimated that all questions would be reserved until the sitting for public examination, appointed for September 19th next, and resolutions were passed to wind up the estate in bankruptcy, with Mr. W. Hurt (Paul Boulton & Co.), 110, Cannon Street, E.C., acting as trustee, assisted by the following committee of inspection, viz.: Mr. Odell (Odell & Son), Mr. J. Lock and Mr. Seymour jun.

WILSON, W., builder, of the Vineyard, Richmond, Surrey.—Particulars were issued on Wednesday to the creditors of the affairs of the debtor, whose public examination is fixed for September 14th, at Wandsworth.
He has been adjudged bankrupt, and an order for summary administration has been made.
The gross liabilities are £1,528, of which £406 16s. 5d. is expected to rank, and the available assets are £406 12s. 9d., so that the deficiency is £406 3s. 8d.
The Official Receiver states that the statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt is
