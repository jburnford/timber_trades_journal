SANITARY ASSOCIATION OF SCOTLAND.—The annual congress of this association will be held in Ayr during the first week of September, under the presidency of Mr. R. W. Cochran Patrick, of Woodside.
The principal items on the programme are—the readings of papers by Sir Charles Cameron, Bart., M.P., on "The Causes of Deaths in Scotland;" by Dr. Russell, Glasgow, on "Administrative Problems;" by Prof. Wright, West of Scotland Technical College, Glasgow, on "Milk and Dairies;" by Principal Walley, Royal Veterinary College, Edinburgh, on "Meat in its Relation to Health;" by the county medical and sanitary inspector of the county of Ayr, on "Consumption of Water in Towns and Villages;" and by Dr. Campbell Munro, medical officer for Renfrewshire, on "Isolation Hospitals for Country Districts."
At the public meeting to be held in the Town-hall, an address will be delivered by Mr. E. C. Robins on "A Century of Sanitary Progress in Great Britain."

THE SANITARY CONDITION OF GLASGOW.—Dr. Russell, with Mr. Fyfe, Chief Sanitary Inspector for the city of Glasgow, has just issued his twenty-third annual report on the operations of the sanitary department for the year ending 31st last.
In the introduction to the report Mr. Fyfe says:—"The death-rate of the extended city for the year 1892 has been 22·3 per 1,000 per annum.
In the old city the death-rate was 23·1.
The addition of our suburbs has consequently subtracted ·8 per 1,000 per annum from the death-rate, that is to say, saved 528 persons who dwell beyond the boundaries of what was the city proper before the extension of 1891, by mingling as one community with the 560,000 people in the old city, and has so leavened the rate over the whole of the area of the Greater Glasgow, with its 700,000 souls, that the Greater Glasgow, with its 700,000 souls, conserves the hygienic conditions of the old city area, under the like conditions of a city of equal size.
This was not fully anticipated.
An earth area of an old Glasgow of equal size.
The people in possession of the demesne of the old city.
Where abundance of fresh air and open fields unbuilt upon surround human habitations, they can live healthier and in their homes and persons be much cleaner nor tidier than they can be in the crowded courts and closes of the old city."
