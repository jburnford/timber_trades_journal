THE LIGHTING OF CRAIGINCHES ENGINEERING WORKS, ABERDEEN.
The other night the new works of Messrs. Harper, Limited, were lighted up by electricity for the first time. The effect was very fine, there being no less than 55 arc lamps, aggregating 75,000 candle power and absorbing three-fourths of the available power of the dynamo, which has a capacity of 100 ampères and a voltage of 260 when run at 725 revolutions per minute. The dynamo is driven by a large Tangye gas-engine, which assists a duplicate engine to drive the main shafting for the whole works. The gas required to drive the dynamo when the whole place is lighted up is only 550 ft. per hour. This economy seems incredible, but is nevertheless a fact. It is probably due to the particular arrangement of installation and the careful selection of the apparatus and lamps, all of which are of the most modern design and manufacture. This trifling amount of gas would only light up a corner of the works were it put through burners in the usual way, instead of being converted into electricity through the engine and dynamo. The installation is a great success, and is the largest of the kind in Scotland, the Glasgow Central Station having little more than half the number of lamps. Notwithstanding the extent, it has been arranged and erected with much economy, due in great part to the skill of Mr. F. Hoppert, electrical engineer from London, who fitted it up. The offices are also nicely lighted up by 35 incandescent lamps, so that no gas is used throughout except for driving engines, of which there are three altogether, to the total exclusion of steam.

TREES FOR ROADS.
(Continued from Page 2, August 19th.)
another variety, the Norway maple (Acer platanoides) is a splendid road tree, although perhaps it will not stand such rough-and-ready treatment as the sycamore. In many respects, however, it is even superior to that variety.
The European lime (Tilia Europæa) does well on a gravel or chalk subsoil. On clay it does not grow to so large a size as on a dryer substratum, on account of its roots being, in a young state, very impatient of moisture, and on this account, at Finchley, where the subsoil is clay, it has been planted on mounds of earth, so that the roots might not allow a tree of more luxuriant growth being used. It is not advisable to plant it in towns or smoky districts, as it has a tendency in dry weather to cast its leaves and produce honeydew, a glutinous liquid covering the whole of the upper surface of the leaves. This has occurred so much so during the prevalent drought that the author has seen it drip off the leaves on to the ground; on account of this the particles of soot and dirt adhere to the leaves, and by so doing not only destroy the beauty of the foliage, but also materially interferes with the growth of the tree. There is also another variety, the Mississippi lime (Tilia Mississipiensis), which the author is informed grows to a large size in some parts of the North of England.
The elm (Ulmus) is not so much used as a road tree as it ought to be, no doubt by reason of its slow growth, but the author wishes to draw the attention of the members of this association to what is known as the Camperdown elm, a variety of the wych elm (Ulmus montana), and to the beautiful habit of growing of its class. The finest specimens of these in the author's opinion cannot be surpassed for road planting. They were planted 45 years ago, and are now 45 ft. high, and perfectly clear and straight in the stem for 20 ft. From this the branches assume a pendulous form similar to the weeping ash, forming in their entire growth a perfect avenue.
The horse chesnut (Æsculus hippocastanum) is also a splendid tree, but its large leaves play sad havoc with the flowers and shrubs that it cannot be recommended for planting except under certain conditions.
In addition to the trees already mentioned the mountain ash (Pyrus aucuparia), suitable for various soils and situations, but subject to the same objections as the horse chesnut; the acacia, various kinds of poplars, and the oak (Quercus) may be mentioned for growth.
The following trees are recommended for towns in the order in which they are named they prefer. In northern and midland positions: Sycamore, any soil; Western plane, any soil; Canadian poplar, any soil; Italian poplar, any soil; black Italian poplar, heavy soil preferred; Lombardy poplar, heavy soil preferred. For seaside positions may be added; it has been found to do well on light soils. In southern and south-midland positions: Western plane, any soil; silver acer foliaged plane, any soil; sycamore, any soil; Canadian poplar, any soil; Canadian poplar, any soil; Canadian poplar, any soil preferred. For seaside positions may be added. The following trees are not affected by sea breeze:—The sycamore, Norway maple, Camperdown elm, the common elm (Ulmus canescens), white poplar, the abele, mountain ash, the common elder (Sambucus excelsior), the common hawthorn, and the sloe. Trees suitable for chalky soils are:—The mountain ash, horse chesnut, the common elm.
Planting.—In obtaining trees it is always preferable to purchase them from a local nurseryman, even though a higher price be paid for them, as on account of the short interval the roots have been exposed to the air to a minimum, and when they are finally put into their places there is every chance of success in transplanting. When the trees are taken up, the roots should be carefully covered up with litter or some other suitable material. It is also advisable to preserve a good bunch of fibrous roots in preference to one or two tap roots, as it is from the small, thready-looking roots that the tree derives its nourishment, and if these are destroyed it is likely to suffer the consequences.
