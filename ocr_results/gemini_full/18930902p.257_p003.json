Quelch, has 9,000 square miles of forests, and some of the trees grow 300 feet high.\nAmong the specimens shown at the World's Fair are 150 different kinds of woods, but only four of these are known commercially in America.\nOne admits of a very bright polish closely resembling gilt.\nGreenheart is valuable for ship wood, as is also mora, the latter growing 200 feet tall, and almost universally hollow.\nWallatia is used for shingles and cooperage, the natural oil in the wood protecting it from the water.\nHitherto British Guiana has imported considerable white pine from America, but native woods are now taking its place.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 259\nTHE WOODS OF AUSTRALIA.\nTHE total forest area of New South Wales, says the Hon. J. P. Hudson, superintendent of the exhibit from that country at the World's Fair, is estimated at about 21,000,000 acres, and we have of over 5,600,000 acres proclaimed covering a total of 1,013 forest reserves, sub-divided in 28 districts, with having resident foresters and travelling inspectors whose duty it is to safeguard these reserves for the future.\nIn 1891 the Forest Department expended 119,375 dollars upon the northern conservation of red cedar, and for other purposes.\nAs in the United States, so also in New South Wales, Arbor Day has been appointed, on which the children of all the public schools plant trees.\nThere is also a State nursery, consisting of over 1,200,000 trees, representing over 250 kinds of timber.\nThere are practically three classes of timber country, divided into open forest, scrub, and brush; these forests producing no less than 630 different kinds of timber of economic value.\nThe finest description of hardwood timbers grow on the ridges and hill sides.\nIron bark has a tensile strain about twice that of English oak, and is extensively used for girders, bridges, and wharves, and whenever great weights are to be carried, and for railroad ties it has no equal.\nSpotted gum is a handsome wood, works readily, and is used for joists, &c., and in ship-building.\nThe heart wood is also very valuable for paving purposes.\nBlue gum and blooded gum are especially prized for wheelwrights' works.\nIt is also good for paving blocks, wharf decking, &c.\nStringy bark, so called from the fibrous nature of its bark, is a good building timber, and is used extensively for paving blocks, and is expected to some day play a part in paper making.\nTallow wood is a grand tree, growing to a great height and size, and makes excellent framing.\nIt is a favourite timber for making floors, ship decks, wharves, &c.\nMountain ash is especially adapted to coopers' work, being free from taste or stain, white, and easily worked.\nTurpentine timber is unequalled for wharf piles, being proof against marine worms, and not affected by salt water.\nThese are but samples of many valuable timbers which grow in open forests.\nThe red cedar is the Australian royal wood, and is beautiful enough to adorn any building erected in these days of great architectural triumphs, and will hold its own with any wood of the world.\nIt is extremely durable, as shown in the Forestry Building by a section of a large cedar log which had been felled and exposed to the elements for more than twenty years without any appreciable decay.\nThe cedar flitches shown in the Forestry Building are merely of the ordinary quality, and not selected for any other purpose than to show it in its ordinary commercial aspect.\nRosewood is most beautiful for furniture and interior finish, and is destined to become extremely valuable.\nBlack and red bean are fancy timbers, especially desirable for fine joiners' work, which are exemplified in the door and architraves in the Forestry Building, which have been transported thousands of miles without affecting the joints.\nThere are suites of furniture in the Manufacturers' Building made of these woods.\nThe beech is a tree of noble proportions, and is in great demand for house building and the fitting up of railway carriages, &c.\nAustralian brush forests cover a considerable area of the country along the coast, and contain tall and graceful ferns reaching a height of 60 ft.\nThey also contain cabbage palms, fig trees, and some of the most useful as well as ornamental hardwood trees, such as silky oak, tulip wood, and ash.\nOne of the principal trees is colonial pine, which grows to a height of 200 ft., and is used for building purposes.\nGrey iron bark has a resistance to breaking 50 per cent. higher than English oak.\nThough the timber resources are so great, Australia imports considerable quantities, chiefly from New Zealand, South Australia, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.",
