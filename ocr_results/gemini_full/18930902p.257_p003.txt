BRITISH GUIANA.—British Guiana, according to the Hon. J. J. Quelch, has 9,000 square miles of forests, and some of the trees grow 300 feet high.
Among the specimens shown at the World's Fair are 150 different kinds of woods, but only four of these are known commercially in America.
One admits of a very bright polish closely resembling gilt.
Greenheart is valuable for ship wood, as is also mora, the latter growing 200 feet tall, and almost universally hollow.
Wallatia is used for shingles and cooperage, the natural oil in the wood protecting it from the water.
Hitherto British Guiana has imported considerable white pine from America, but native woods are now taking its place.

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 259
THE WOODS OF AUSTRALIA.
THE total forest area of New South Wales, says the Hon. J. P. Hudson, superintendent of the exhibit from that country at the World's Fair, is estimated at about 21,000,000 acres, and we have of over 5,600,000 acres proclaimed covering a total of 1,013 forest reserves, sub-divided in 28 districts, with having resident foresters and travelling inspectors whose duty it is to safeguard these reserves for the future.
In 1891 the Forest Department expended 119,375 dollars upon the northern conservation of red cedar, and for other purposes.
As in the United States, so also in New South Wales, Arbor Day has been appointed, on which the children of all the public schools plant trees.
There is also a State nursery, consisting of over 1,200,000 trees, representing over 250 kinds of timber.
There are practically three classes of timber country, divided into open forest, scrub, and brush; these forests producing no less than 630 different kinds of timber of economic value.
The finest description of hardwood timbers grow on the ridges and hill sides.
Iron bark has a tensile strain about twice that of English oak, and is extensively used for girders, bridges, and wharves, and whenever great weights are to be carried, and for railroad ties it has no equal.
Spotted gum is a handsome wood, works readily, and is used for joists, &c., and in ship-building.
The heart wood is also very valuable for paving purposes.
Blue gum and blooded gum are especially prized for wheelwrights' works.
It is also good for paving blocks, wharf decking, &c.
Stringy bark, so called from the fibrous nature of its bark, is a good building timber, and is used extensively for paving blocks, and is expected to some day play a part in paper making.
Tallow wood is a grand tree, growing to a great height and size, and makes excellent framing.
It is a favourite timber for making floors, ship decks, wharves, &c.
Mountain ash is especially adapted to coopers' work, being free from taste or stain, white, and easily worked.
Turpentine timber is unequalled for wharf piles, being proof against marine worms, and not affected by salt water.
These are but samples of many valuable timbers which grow in open forests.
The red cedar is the Australian royal wood, and is beautiful enough to adorn any building erected in these days of great architectural triumphs, and will hold its own with any wood of the world.
It is extremely durable, as shown in the Forestry Building by a section of a large cedar log which had been felled and exposed to the elements for more than twenty years without any appreciable decay.
The cedar flitches shown in the Forestry Building are merely of the ordinary quality, and not selected for any other purpose than to show it in its ordinary commercial aspect.
Rosewood is most beautiful for furniture and interior finish, and is destined to become extremely valuable.
Black and red bean are fancy timbers, especially desirable for fine joiners' work, which are exemplified in the door and architraves in the Forestry Building, which have been transported thousands of miles without affecting the joints.
There are suites of furniture in the Manufacturers' Building made of these woods.
The beech is a tree of noble proportions, and is in great demand for house building and the fitting up of railway carriages, &c.
Australian brush forests cover a considerable area of the country along the coast, and contain tall and graceful ferns reaching a height of 60 ft.
They also contain cabbage palms, fig trees, and some of the most useful as well as ornamental hardwood trees, such as silky oak, tulip wood, and ash.
One of the principal trees is colonial pine, which grows to a height of 200 ft., and is used for building purposes.
Grey iron bark has a resistance to breaking 50 per cent. higher than English oak.
Though the timber resources are so great, Australia imports considerable quantities, chiefly from New Zealand, South Australia, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
