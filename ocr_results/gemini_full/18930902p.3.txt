[From our own Correspondent.]
Cargoes arrived:—One from Quebec, with deals, &c., per Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells; one from St. John, N.B., & Co.
The market for Quebec remains unchanged, but prices are firm, and passing at steady prices.
The shipbuilding industry is active, and there are a number of contracts about to be placed, particularly for the cottages in South Govan. The work of this particular district is in the hands of Mr. James Black.
Shipbuilding prospects are a good deal brighter, and there are a good number of contracts reported. The orders very satisfactory; the orders booked during the month secured represent an aggregate of 5,000 tons, and four vessels, ranging from 1,600 to 3,500 tons. Several local firms, too, have orders to build steamers for their own ch owners, and a sailer of considerable capacity. The ship-repairing yards have been brisk. There were launched on the Clyde here during August.

There is nothing special to report in the state of the coal trade this week.

NEW CONTRACT. — Messrs. D. & W. Henderson & Co., Glasgow, have placed a contract for a large steamship of about 4,000 tons deadweight with Messrs. D. and W. Henderson & Co.
FIRE AT A GLASGOW CHAIR FACTORY.— On Tuesday morning an outbreak of fire occurred on the premises of H. & A. G. Alexander & Co., chairmakers, French Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow. A brick building of three storeys in the square was gutted, and damage was done to the amount of £1,000.
We understand that Messrs. John & James White, sanitary specialists, 74, Union Street, Glasgow, have opened larger and more central premises at 111, St. Vincent Street, Glasgow, owing to the greatly increasing demand for their sanitary appliances in Scotland, and most of their specialities can be seen there in action.
A sub-committee of the Town Council of Rothesay with reference to the restoration of the parish church have examined a number of plans for the erection of a new church, and have agreed to recommend the Town Council to adopt the plan of Mr. J. J. Burnett. It is understood that its being found that the work can be carried out at the specified cost.
