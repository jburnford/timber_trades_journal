Coal ... ... 92 ... 94
Sundries ... 131 ... 124
---
Total ... 836 ... 784
The directors have appointed Lieut.-Colonel Major-Gen. Charles Scrope Hutchinson, C.B., to be a director of this Company, in the place of the late Mr. Oliphant.
Malcolm in place of Mr. J. H. W. Schroder, who has retired.
The directors have to report with deep regret the death of their esteemed colleague, Mr. Frederick Chalmers, who had been a director of this Company from its formation in 1865, and for the previous seven years, from 1858, been a director of the Commercial Dock Company.
The directors recommend that an interim dividend for the current year, being at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, free of Income Tax, be declared on the ordinary stock and on preference stock A, for the six months ending September 30th next, payable on October 5th next.

CAMEO WOOD MOULDING COMPANY.
-This company has been registered with a capital of £4,000, in £1 shares, to carry on the business of manufacturers of and dealers in wood mouldings in high-class woods for picture-frames, decorating surfaces, furniture, &c., and to undertake the trade of timber merchants, sawyers, sterers, and workers in wood.

COLLINSON & LOCK.
-This company was registered on August 29th, with a capital of £100,000 in £10 shares, to acquire the goodwill of the business of decorative artists, dealers in works of art, cabinet makers, &c., carried on at 76, 78, and 80, Oxford-street, and 34, 35, and Freston Place, and at the London and North-Western Railway arches, Nos. 1 to 8, under the title of Collinson & Lock, under the trusts of the will of the late F. G. Collinson, and to continue the same.

FORESTS IN BRITAIN.
-In many parts of Britain there are lying waste immense tracts of land in hills and valleys, which are at present yielding no return.
We are lying waste at home, while we are paying foreigners for what we might grow ourselves.
The European Syndicate has been formed on this account.
Their object is not of a derogatory nature, but simply to purchase "the lands of the poor lairds," which are often of rich virgin soil.

THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
-The Hawaiian Gazette says that the Columbia-Hawaii Company, which was recently established in Honolulu, has already shipped to Honolulu from the Sound some 1,500,000ft. of material.
The company has also brought many shingles from the Sound, and will place them in Honolulu in place of iron roofs.
