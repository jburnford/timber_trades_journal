Charles Alexander Sim, in place of the late Mr. Oliphant, and Mr. William Forrest Malcolm in place of Mr. Park resigned. The directors have to regret the death, during the past half-year, of one of their most valued colleagues, Mr. John Mews, who had been a director of this company since the amalgamation in 1865, and had previously, from the year 1858, been a director of the late Commercial Dock Company. The directors recommend that an interim dividend of £2 10s. per cent., being at the rate of £5 per cent per annum, free of Income Tax, be declared on the ordinary stock and on preference stock \"A,\" for the six months ending September 30th, payable on October 5th next.\nCAMEO WOODWORKING COMPANY, LIMITED.—This company was registered with a capital of £4,000, in £1 shares, to carry on the business of manufacturers of embossed and other mouldings in high relief or otherwise, and of decorating surfaces of solid wood; and to undertake the trade of cabinet makers, upholsterers, and workers in wood generally.\nCOLLINSON & LOCK, LIMITED.—This company was registered with a capital of £65,000, to acquire the good will of the business of decorative artists, cabinet makers, upholsterers, dealers in works of art, &c., carried on at 68, 76, 78, and 80, Oxford Street, at Perry's Place, and Freston Place, by W. Collinson and G. J. Lock, under the style of Collinson & Lock; and to continue this undertaking.\nFORESTS IN BRAZIL.—Thousands of acres of hills and valleys covered with primeval forests are lying waste in Brazil owing to the Government there refusing to sell or lease lands to the European Syndicate on account. Their curious reason is that it would be derogatory and undignified to part with \"the lands of the people.\" These huge tracts of rich virgin soil are thus remaining profitless.\nTHE HAWAIIAN TRADE.—The new British Columbia-Hawaiian line of steamers has succeeded in introducing red cedar sash and doors in Hawaii. The first finish for a house was recently shipped by Wheeler, Osgood, & Co., of Tacoma, to Honolulu, and it is said that several orders have been lately placed for the same kind of material. The new line is also taking a good many shingles from Vancouver, to be used at Honolulu in place of redwood.\nFORESTRY IN EUROPE.—The progress made in forestry in Europe is exciting the attention of the press until Our European exchanges are loaded with reports of progress in this field. In Germany, France, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and vast territories which amounted to simple wastes have been carefully covered with forests, whose value cannot be estimated to come. Reports from Europe which convince everyone that an enormous industry might be profitably carried on in this country by the government and people which would be many fold more than has been during the last half century, or does now.—The Mississippi Valley Lumberman.\n\n287\nGAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nADAMS, H., builder, Lee Villas, Manor Lane, Sutton.—The following are the creditors in this recent failure:—\nUNSECURED. £ s. d.\nAldin & Co., Richmond, S.W. ... 68 11 2\nDavis & Co., Sutton ... 97 0 0\nElliott S., Albert Joinery Works, Newbury ... 21 11 6\nGregg & Co., Loughborough ... 11 6 9\nSandell & Co., Sutton ... 22 19 10\nTaylor & Brooker, Dorking ... 31 12 5\nWaterman —, Carshalton Road, Sutton ... 68 18 11\nWakeford —, High Street, Sutton ... 15 9 11\nBURT, FREDERICK, builder, 2, Stockfield Road, Streatham.—Particulars of this case were given last week.

The debtor said he commenced business in 1886. The books he kept were a ledger and memorandum books. He had been in the habit of borrowing money from a money-lender for the last six years. The debtor further stated that in July last a meeting of his creditors was held; but he made no offer, and he did not know what took place, as they asked him to leave the room. He could have paid his creditors 20s. in the pound two years ago, although in his answers to the printed questions he had stated that he had made no profits for several years. The examination was then adjourned.\nGREENWOOD, P. A., upholstery warehouseman and saw-mills proprietor, Curtain Road, E.C., Church Road, Bethnal Green, and Romford Road, E. This failure occurred in June last, and the case came before Mr. Registrar Hope, on Tuesday, upon the hearing of an application for the approval of resolutions passed by the creditors for the acceptance of a composition of 9s. 6d. in the pound, a claim of £530 being withdrawn. Mr. Howell, Assistant Receiver, reported that only part of the amount required for payment of the composition had yet been deposited, but as the scheme was undoubtedly a beneficial one for the creditors, he consented to the application standing over for a short time, in order that the deposit might be completed. His Honour adjourned the application for a fortnight.\nHOWELL, JOHN, builder and contractor, Penarth Road, Cardiff.—The public examination of this debtor was fixed for Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Langley, at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £5,250, and assets estimated to produce £2,200. The examination was adjourned.\nKNUDSEN, BROTHERS, & CO., timber agents, 25, Wormwood Street, E. C.—The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Tuesday, before Mr. G. W. Chapman, Assistant Receiver. The statement of affairs had not been lodged, but the liabilities are estimated roughly at about £6,000, and the assets at £2,000. The business was commenced by Mr. K. F. Knudsen and Mr. Arter in 1880 with a capital of £3,000 provided by Mr. Arter. The trading was carried on under the style of Knudsen, Arter, & Co. until 1883, when Mr. Arter withdrew. Mr. Knudsen continued the business at the same address, 75, Gracechurch Street, and in 1884 he arranged with his creditors and paid them a composition of 6s. 6d. in the pound. He resumed business the following year in partnership with his brother removing to Lime Street in 1886, and again in 1889 to Wormwood Street. In December, 1890, the debtors started a wood wool factory at Rotherhithe, and traded there for twelve months. The trading there was then carried on under the style of Eley Brothers in order to keep the business distinct from that of Knudsen, Brothers, & Co. carried on in Wormwood Street. The debtors attribute their failure to the forced sale of the machinery and fixtures at the Rotherhithe factory by the landlord in July last, to liabilities on bills accepted without consideration, to bad debts, and to law costs. The debtors made no proposal, and consented to their affairs being wound up in bankruptcy. Mr. Paul A. Boulton, accountant, 110, Cannon Street, E.C., was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection. The public examination is fixed for October 17th.\nLORD, JOSEPH, builder and monumental stonemason, 1, Oswald Terrace, Newport, near Middlesbrough; and Marsh Road, Linthorpe Road; and Borough Road, Middlesbrough.—In this arrangement the following are among the creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBall George (Exors. of), Middlesbrough ... 141 0 0\nBenjamin H., Middlesbrough ... 180 0 0\nCalvert John, Middlesbrough ... 149 0 0\nCroosler John, Middlesbrough ... 29 0 0\nCrombie & Son, Middlesbrough ... 278 0 0\nDunwell John & James, Grasmont ... 40 0 0\nDunning Walton, Middlesbrough ... 66 0 0\nEaton William, Middlesbrough ... 166 0 0\nGoody, Cripps, & Son, London ... 30 0 0\nHudson John, Middlesbrough ... 80 0 0\nHull & Hoggett, Middlesbrough ... 109 0 0\nHutchinson Bros., Middlesbrough ... 83 0 0\nLupton H. & T.

L. Hough, Official Receiver, attended at the Bankruptcy Court to conduct the examination of this debtor, who stated that prior to October, 1891, he was in the employ of Mr. Ernest Zuccani, a timber merchant, for eighteen years. That gentleman failed in 1891, and for some time subsequently witness was employed by the trustee under the bankruptcy. He was allowed to pass upon accounts showing total liabilities £437 13s 1d. (unsecured £330 16s. 3d.), and assets £28 2s 8d.\nMORGAN, ISTED, & MORGAN, builders, Southampton.—The failure of this extensive firm is announced, a petition being filed by Cecil Herbert Morgan, of Llanberis, Gordon Avenue, Portswood; Samuel Eveland Isted, 8, Portland Terrace; and Edward Percy Morgan, of 11, Park Road, Portswood, trading together at Bevois Valley Works, Empress Road, Southampton, on Monday by Mr. R. R. Linthorne, and the usual receiving order was made. The amount of liabilities and assets were not disclosed.\nMURDOCH, MUNRO MARTIN, builder, 2, Church Road, Cadoxton-juxta-Barry. —The statutory meeting of the creditors was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Cardiff. The debtor's summary of accounts showed liabilities amounting to £454 1s. 9d., of which £252 18s. 6d. was due to the fully secured creditors, and the balance was expected to rank against the estate. The assets were returned at £162 3s. 5d. The meeting decided to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.\nWALKER, HENRY, builder, Pembroke Street, Oxford.—This bankrupt came up for his public examination at the Oxford Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week before the registrar. He said he commenced business in 1884 with £150. He did not believe the cash book was placed before the creditors when the assignment was made to Mr. Kingerlee in June last. It had been posted up since the date of the receiving order. He paid nearly all cash during the past three years. Shortly after the meeting of creditors in June he sold about £24 worth of stock to pay wages. The statement of affairs put before the meeting showed a deficiency of £160 9s. 5d., but a month afterwards he returned it at £1,333 13s. that overestimating his assets. The examination was eventually adjourned in order that the debtor might furnish a detailed deficiency account, and an account of the advances he had received from a Mr Guerrier.\nWRIGHT, ROBERT, builder, Eastlake, Peterboro'.—This bankrupt came up for his public examination at last sitting of the Peterborough Bankruptcy Court. He said he commenced business ten years ago. After the debtor had been questioned at some length by",
