Brownlee & Co., whilst the other shipments are divided among various importers. The deals and boards landed ex steamer are in nice bright condition.\nOn the 5th inst., Messrs. Garland & Roger held an important auction at their sale-rooms, Edinburgh Dock. The very large and varied catalogue of goods advertised attracted a very numerous company of buyers both from town and country. Besides a recently-landed cargo of Quebec waney board pine and hardwood ex Quebec, and a steamer shipment of Baltic deals, the catalogue included American walnut, States oak, wainscot, American whitewood, and pitch pine deals, with a large and varied assortment of Baltic deals and battens, flooring, lining, and larkings. There was a good clearance of goods, and although prices were, in some instances, on the cheap side, sellers on the whole, were satisfied, and exposers must have been pleased with the result. The following were the ruling prices :—Waney board pine, £10 15s. to £11; square pine (2nd quality), £8 10s. to £9; oak, 3s.; birch, 1s. 6d. to 1s. 9d.; elm, 3s. to 4s. 6d.; canary whitewood, 2s. to 2s. 3d., all per cubic foot. Pitch pine deals, 1s, 1st quality broad, 3s. to 3s. 3d. The sale did not conclude until a late hour.\n\nPERTH.\nAt the public sale held here on Wednesday there was a very fair attendance of buyers from the district, and a large quantity was sold.

A. & G. Paton's, formerly Messrs. Mitchell, Thomson & Co.'s saw-mills, met in the Granton Hotel on Friday, the 1st inst., and presented Mr. George Swan with a beautifully illuminated address, a purse of sovereigns, and a highly eulogistic certificate of character from the firm, on the occasion of his leaving for New Zealand. Mr. Swan had been 21 years' service in the saw mills, part of the time as foreman in the saw sharpening department. The presentation was made by Mr. Masterton, who spoke in a very kindly and sympathetic way, and Mr. Swan suitably replied.\nDISAPPEARANCE OF AN OLD BUILDING.—In carrying out the operations in connection with the enlargement of the Bonanza Warehouse, there has been involved the disappearance of a landmark of ancient Glasgow. For about a century the building, which was known for long as His Lordship's Larder Hotel, occupied a prominent site at the north-west corner of St. Enoch's Square, and during that period many changes took place. Towards the close of last century the square was a fashionable residential quarter, but in the course of a few years after its completion the city entered upon the state of transition with which dwellers in towns are familiar, namely, the conversion of residence giving place to the business office and the wareroom. In the process the building just demolished, however, appears to have been early converted into an inn, and as such became widely known.\n\nSEPTEMBER 9, 1893.\nThe Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nAug. 29 Elise Marie—Fredrikshaven—10 lds. sawn fir firewood—Hermansen\n30 Sophie—Gefle—45 lds. sawn fir firewood—Gordon & Co.\n31 State of Georgia (s)—Montreal—425 pcs. oak—J.
