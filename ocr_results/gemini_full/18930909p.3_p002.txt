BRITISH AND ITALIAN GRANITE.—The question of using British granite or Italian granite for the Jamaica Bridge, Glasgow, is under consideration by the Bridges Committee of the Corporation.
The difference in price between the two granites is said to be accounted for by the difference in the rate of wages paid in this country and in Italy.
Workers in granite in Italy are paid at the rate of 2½d. an hour, while those in Aberdeenshire and Cornwall receive the standard pay, 8d. an hour.
At the recent meeting a long discussion took place on the merits of the respective granites, and a sample of the Italian granite was laid on the table and examined by the committee.
The appearance of the Italian granite did not seem to favourably impress the members of the committee.

INSTITUTE OF BRITISH CARRIAGE-MAKERS.—The sixth annual autumnal meeting of the Institute of British Carriage-makers was opened on Tuesday in the Imperial Hotel, Aberdeen.
The President of the institute (Mr. M'Naught, Worcester) delivered an address, in which he said their trade had very humble beginnings, and was still very much more a matter of rule of thumb than intellectual study; but to the younger members of the institute it was becoming something more.
Prizes were offered for specimens of work by artisans, and the awards have been announced.
Mr. Andrew M'Nair, Thistle Street, Garnethill, Glasgow, gets a prize of £5 for the best painting of a coat of arms, and Mr. James Robertson, Carnarvon Street, Glasgow, a prize of £1, as the second award, for the best painted crest and monogram.
