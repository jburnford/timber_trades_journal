SEPTEMBER 16, 1893.
PLUMBERS' CONGRESS.
REGISTRATION AGAIN.
The annual congress of Plumbers, Registration of Plumbers, was held in Marischal College, Aberdeen, last week, delegates were present from all parts of the country. On the opening of the proceedings, Stewart welcomed the delegates.
Professor Matthew Hay, on behalf of the district council of Aberdeen, Kincardineshire, and Banff, delivered his presidential address. He dwelt upon the great importance of registration from a sanitary point of view, and referred with disappointment to the recent defeat of the Registration Bill. The movement was one of great national utility, and was being more and more appreciated. In conclusion, he pressed the necessity of everywhere had a special committee to give adequate assistance from the outside.
Reports as to the progress of the movement in the different districts were submitted, and were generally satisfactory.
Mr. Galloway, of Glasgow, opened a discussion on the question of providing for cheaper books on sanitary science than were at present available. He provided for the operation of the scheme, a resolution was passed.
Congress decided not to take up the question of sub-contracting as a specific remedy, although it was admitted that but it was agreed that the system should be universally condemned, and a plumber registered under the national system.
Mr. J. J. Henders raised the question as to whether the technical Institutions were to be open from Town or County Councils should be restricted to those engaged in particular trades, or whether they should be open to outsiders. As a legacy to his successor, the question, the Congress referred the consideration of the matter to the Council.
Boswells, in addressing the Congress, drew attention to the fact that many master plumbers were not thoroughly qualified.
Dr. Hay (the president) expressed the hope that in course of time there would be on the registration list of plumbers a course of technical instruction.
Congress was fixed to be held at Inverness.
