PHILIPS, C. N., builder, &c., 29, Queen Victoria Street, E.C., and Bermondsey. The debtor has filed his petition, and upon the application of Messrs. Hughes, Hooker & Co, a receiving order was made last week by Mr Registrar Giffard. The debtor states that the rent of his offices in Queen Street is £200 a year, and that a quarter is overdue. The office furniture was valued at about £50, and the debtor states that he has building plant, &c., at the works in Bermondsey Street, of saleable value of about £108. The furniture at the debtor's residence at Wanstead, was estimated to realise about £130, but some of the things belonged to his wife. The liabilities were stated to be under £3,000.
SMITH & CO, brick and tile manufacturers and builders' merchants, Wharfe Street and Trent Vale, Stoke-on-Trent, and New Street, Crewe. A meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held on Tuesday, at the North Stafford Hotel, Stoke-on-Trent, when the Official Receiver, Mr. Thos. Bulloch, presided. There were a large number of creditors present, and Mr. Tattinson, Mr. Furnival, Mr. T. W. Hollingshead, Mr. Jno. F. Dyson, and Mr. J. H. Stott, also represented creditors. The statement of affairs which had been prepared by Messrs. J. Freeman Dyson & Co., chartered accountants, of Leeds and Huddersfield, showed liabilities £10,789 1s. 5d., and net assets £5,128 10s. 11d. Mr. Dyson explained some particulars with reference to the statement of affairs. The Official Receiver proposed, and Mr. Peake seconded the nomination of Mr. Jno F. Dyson, chartered accountant, Leeds and Huddersfield, and Mr. J. H. Scott, incorporated accountant and manager of the Timber Trades Association of Hull and Liverpool, as trustees, with a Committee of Inspection of five of the principal creditors.

WARD, BATLEY WILLIAM, joiner and builder, Paddock, Huddersfield.—The first meeting of creditors interested herein was held on Monday last at the Official Receiver's offices, Huddersfield. The debtor's statement of affairs showed unsecured liabilities amounting to £630 11s. 2d., and the assets, after deducting claims of preference creditors payable in full, were returned at £63 18s. 3d., thus leaving a deficit of £566 12s. 11d. The debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through bad trade, want of capital, and depreciation of property. The Official Receiver reported that the debtor commenced business six years ago with a capital of £40. In 1887 he entered into partnership with a man named Henry Egleston but the latter retired from the business in the following year, and was paid £10 down, the debtor then took over all the liabilities and assets. No resolutions were passed, the estate will be dealt with by the Official Receiver.
WARD, T. G., builder, of Foot's Cray, Road, Putney.—Particulars of this failure have been issued, and the first meeting of creditors was fixed for yesterday (Friday). The gross liabilities are £4,314, of which £764 17s. 8d. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend. There are no assets. The debtor alleges as the cause of his failure, "underestimating contracts." The receiving order was made on a creditor's petition, and he has been adjudicated bankrupt. The debtor states that for the two years preceding his bankruptcy he had been building on his own account for his wife, and that when he contracted his first fresh debts he had no capital of his own. He says he first became aware of his insolvency in November, 1892, since when he has contracted debts.
