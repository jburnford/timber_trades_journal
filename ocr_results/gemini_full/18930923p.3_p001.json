There will thus be many different ages of wood as there are years in the cycle of their growth. It is usual to classify together all wood from 1 to 20 years of age as one age class, all wood from 20 to 40 years as a second age class, from 40 to 60 years as a third age class, and so on. The relative order of these classes is a preliminary consideration as well of sylviculture as of forest organisation. Regarded as a question of sylviculture, restricted to the successful raising and care of masses of wood, the general question of the proper order of ages will be found to be determined by the prevailing wind. On the Continent of Europe, all thoroughly organised forests are arranged with reference to the prevailing wind or direction of storms, which has universally been observed to be the west. In a very few exceptional cases, in mountainous districts, or at the openings of valleys, another wind may have to be guarded against; but, as a rule, it is the west wind that is to be feared. The prevalence of westerly winds in the northern temperate zone is explained in the English Cyclopædia as follows: \"The heated equatorial air, while it rises and flows over towards the poles, carries with it the rotatory velocity due to its equatorial situa-tion into a higher latitude, where the earth's surface has less motion. Hence, as it travels northward or southward, it will gain continually more and more on the surface of the earth in its diurnal motion and assume constantly more and more a westerly relative direction, and when at length it returns to the surface in its circulation, as it must do more or less in all the intervals between the tropics and the poles, it will act on it by its friction, as a powerful south-west wind in the northern hemisphere and a north-west in the southern, and restore to it the impulse taken up from it at the equator. We have here the origin\n\nof the south-west and westerly gales so prevalent in our latitudes, and of the almost universal westerly winds in the North Atlantic, which are, in fact, nothing more than a part of the general system of the reaction of the trades, and of the process which the equilibrium of the earth's motion is maintained under their action. An ordinary observation of trees growing singly, and exposed on a plain or table-land, will generally find evidences of their having suffered from the west wind. Trees so situated will be observed to lean towards the east, having been bent over by the superior force of the west wind. Trees which have been blown down will be found to have been overturned by a westerly wind in the great majority of instances. Meteoro-logical registers, too, will bear out the fact that the strongest gales blow from the north-west, west, or south-west in most parts of this country.\nWhen, as often happens, it is wished to fell a mass of ripe timber gradually or in yearly portions, if a quantity be cut out of the middle of the mass so as to leave a con-siderable hole, the consequence is that the next strong wind takes hold of the gap and overturns trees on all sides which had grown up less firmly rooted in the interior shelter. The same sort of catastrophe happens if a narrow clearing be driven inwards towards the centre of the mass. But the worst of all havoc would be worked by the wind in the case of any form of clearing from the west side. It has, therefore, been found necessary to commence clearings from the east, or sheltered side of a mass of ripe timber. If a mass of wood of the next younger age class were on the east side, adjoining the timber being cleared, the west wind would be suddenly let on to it after a life-long growth in the shelter, and a disastrous and extensive windfall might be expect d. If on the contrary, the next younger age class ad-joined on the west side, with a still younger mass of wood beyond it to the west, it would not be at all exposed by the clearing; but, after the gradual felling of the ripe timber, it might itself be mature, and the clearing would advance still regularly west-ward. It is evident, also, that in the latter\n\ncase each class of age would grow up in constant health, partially sheltered by exposure to the wind, and having the full force of the wind indirectly mitigated by its backing of higher wood. Thus we may conclude that age classes should be arranged in sequences, with ages diminishing towards the west, and that in this same direction it is possible to guide a regular course of successive clearings or fellings.\nIt may not be amiss to approach the question of short digression by means of a contribution into the region of forest organisation.\n(To be continued)\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nSept. 11 Grip Fast-Hudikswall-855 lds. fir deals, battens, and boards-J.
