the weak position of this wood in the consumptive market.
A number of large lots of hardwoods are spoken of as being marked ready for disposal.
An impetus seems to have been given to tree planting in many parts of the country.
The various nurserymen report that not before have they booked so many extensive orders, several having their available supplies practically exhausted.

TRADE REPORTS.

DUNDEE.
The demand here seems to slacken somewhat, but the saw-mills are still fairly busy, and prices, as might be expected from the advanced values abroad, continue very firm.
There is very little local work of importance in prospect, and the staple trade is very quiet, although large additions are presently being made to at least one of the town's factories in at the county, thereby showing confidence in some quarters in the future of the trade, notwithstanding the present admitted depression.
Arrivals here for the week are trifling, being only a Sundswall cargo of red timber and white batten stowage for Messrs. Bell & Sime, Lim., in all 650 loads, while same firm has a steamer's deckload of 50 standards 8 x 3 white deals.

GLASGOW.
Imports of wood goods to the Clyde continue moderate; this is specially so at Greenock, where the quietness in arrivals of log timber has been very marked for some time past.
Deliveries have been proceeding at a satisfactory rate, prices are well maintained, and the prospect for stocks on hand is encouraging; the stocks are at present being summed up for the usual quarterly statement, and particulars will be ready for next issue.
The interest, as large deliveries, particularly pitch pine, have taken place recently, while imports, as above noted, have been quiet.
The arrivals of deals since last writing have consisted of a few parcels per the regular steam liners from Montreal, but little addition to stock.
The first expected arrival of deals, however, of substantial amount is at hand, the first expected being per s.s. Straits of Magellan, from Montreal, which is now due, and comprises about 400 standards (St. Petersburg) pine and spruce deals consigned to Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchel's, and 100 standards to Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.
At the log storage ground, Queen's Dock, the yarding has been going on of the large cargo of Honduras mahogany, per Thorgny, from Belize, which, we observe, is turning out of excellent quality.
The discharge will be finished early next week, and the cargo, we understand, is to be brought to auction by Messrs. Allison, Cousland & Co. soon thereafter, probably the 10th October.
The Nerano, from Baltimore, has just arrived, and brings several parcels of wood goods—walnut logs, oak planks, &c.
There have been no auction sales to report during the past week.
We hear of some considerable transactions privately, including a good line of hardwood logs, which will lighten the stock in store at Queen's Dock.

GREENOCK.
The course of the timber trade here is of the most uneventful character, with practically nothing to relieve the rather dull monotony of the present quiet routine business.
There have been no imports during the week, and the deliveries from the ponds have been on the whole quieter than for some time.
Prices keep firm in consequence of restricted stocks, and everything points to

values being maintained at a steady level.
The cargoes lately arrived have now all been discharged and stored, and a portion of the goods will be submitted to competition at Edmiston & Mitchells' auction sale, announced for the 5th proximo.
The long-continued strike in the local cabinet-making trade has most happily terminated, and work has been resumed in all the departments.
One or two orders for sailing vessels have recently been placed with local shipbuilders, but a few of the yards have been rather unsuccessful in securing any portion of the work placed lately.

LEITH.
Since our last, we have to report the following arrivals, viz., the Hilda, from Memel, with 26,760 staves; the Insulau, from Sundswall, with 9,812 deals and battens, for Messrs. Forslind & Rex; the Alma, from Helsingfors, with 72 fathoms firewood, and 38 staves deals and battens, for Messrs. Ch. Salvesen & Co.; the Alice, from Archangel, with 7,260 deals and battens, for Messrs. John Mitchell & Co.; the Petersburg (s), from Cronstadt, with 38,842 deals and battens, 22 fathoms firewood, and 3,413 pieces lathwood, for various importers; and the Gerona (s), from Montreal, with 3,328 pine deals, 1,182 pine boards, and 193 logs timber, for Messrs. John Mitchell & Co.
There are some further arrivals just reported, including the steamer Longhirst, from Quebec, for Messrs. Park, Dobson & Co., but details are not yet available, and will be given in our next.
There is no change to remark upon in the state of trade, which continues rather quiet.
This feeling was reflected in the auction held on Tuesday, 26th inst., at the Edinburgh Dock, by Mr. D. W. Beattie.
Although there was a large assortment of both White Sea and Baltic deals and battens offered, the attendance of buyers was below the average, and the quantity disposed of correspondingly restricted.
As regards prices, the exposer was quite firm in his limits, and for what was sold full current rates were obtained, as undernoted:—
