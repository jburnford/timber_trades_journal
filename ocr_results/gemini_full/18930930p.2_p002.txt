ABERDEEN.
ABERDEEN.—The Plans Committee of the Town Council have sanctioned a considerable number of buildings, including new hospital at the Royal Lunatic Asylum, per Messrs. W. and J. Smith and Kelly, architects, and additions to the city hospital, per Mr. John Rust, jun., city architect. At a recent meeting of the Ellon District Committee of the Aberdeen County Council, it was agreed to form the village of Tarves and suburbs into a special water and drainage district, at an estimated cost of £800, the sewage to be disposed of for irrigation.

THE FUTURE OF BRITISH HONDURAS.—Sir Alfred Maloney, the Governor of British Honduras, in his latest report to the Colonial Office, discusses at some length the present position and future prospects of this somewhat remote British colony. He points out that for two centuries British Honduras has relied almost entirely upon its forest produce, and on its rivers as means of transport to the sea. But in view of the experience of other colonies which have depended on one staple industry he thinks the experiment of "carrying your eggs in one basket" a very hazardous one. The products of the colony's cultural industries, still really in their infancy, are chiefly bananas, plantains, cocoanuts, coffee, henequin, Indian corn, limes, mangoes, oranges, sour and sweet pineapples, avocado pears, rubber, to which there should be added in time arnatto, cacao, coir, ground nut, indigo, jute, pita ramie, spices, vanilla, and doubtless other promising market-able commodities. The cohune oil industry remains yet dormant except for domestic and cooking purposes, to which uses it is put among the families of mahogany and logwood cutters. The pine, it is estimated, covers a third of the colony, or 1,613,136 acres, and averages 100 trees per acre on the great southern pine ridge, and much more in other parts. Its wood is said to almost equal that of the yellow pine of the United States, which, in the beginning of 1888, was reported to have been nearly worked out, and might, in part, have to be replaced by the local pine. The growth on the older pine ridges of the colony may, when opened up, prove of sufficient age and diameter to make it worth while to have attention turned to adding this timber to the exports of the colony, as can doubtless be done with many other valu-able woods as yet unknown.
THE FIRE PROTECTION OF ALEXANDRIA.—Some years back Messrs. Merryweather & Sons supplied a floating steam fire engine to the Alexandria Fire Department. The engine has given very excellent results both as a fire-float and tug-boat. The owners of the large cotton factories have now decided to adopt a similar means of fire protection, with a view also to materially diminish their insurance rates. The new fire-float, which is also being constructed by Messrs. Merryweather & Sons, consists of one of their powerful fire engines of the "Greenwich" type, as used by the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, and is to be fitted in a steel barge. The fire engine is so arranged as to drive

two propellers, and the boat will be tested on the Thames prior to its departure for Egypt. Its pumping powers are 2,000 gallons of water per minute, and it will be arranged to pump twelve jets of water simultaneously, while the draught of the little craft, which is sixty feet in length, will not exceed eighteen inches.
RAILWAYS IN IRELAND.—Major-General Hutchinson, of the Board of Trade, has been inspecting the South and West Kerry Railways. He was accompanied by Mr. F. H. Faulkiner, contractor of the lines; Mr. T. Scott, engineer; and Mr. H. A. Ivatt, engineer, Great Southern and Western Railway. Three heavy engines were carried over both lines, and it appears that each line admirably stood the test of this heavy freight. The South Kerry Railway will be opened for traffic in a few weeks. The West Kerry Railway will also be opened in or about the same time. These lines will open up two extensive districts of Kerry. The scenery along either sides is diversified by mountains, glens, &c., with occasional glances of the Atlantic.
WOODS AND TREES.
THE Board of Agriculture desire to direct attention to the increased facilities for the planting of woods and trees in Scotland afforded by the Improvement of Land (Scot-land) Act, 1893, which received the Royal assent on August 24 last. Hitherto owners of land in Scotland have been able, with the sanction of the Board of Agriculture, to charge their estates for the planting of woods and trees only in cases where the planting is for the purpose of providing shelter. By the Act in question this limitation has been removed, and applications may now be made to the Board for sanction to charge estates, under the provisions of the Improvement of Land Act, 1864, with the cost of planting, whether for shelter or otherwise.
