I have cut off branches with similar success from fruit trees, but early in the spring was extremely gratified to find the cious and healing qualities of dung tried it upon some large wounds standing to observe how far the wounds have healed in the course of this time, and this has been done trees in general have made great as in some others, and in one of them, and found some of the wounds had increased an inch and a quarter, and three-eighths. From these experiments concerning the efficacy of dung in accelerating the healing of in trees, it appears that it has efficacy the first season, and that at the time, or as soon as possible wounds are made, is the proper time when the young bark is tender, and the wound is complete, and therefore in some kind of covering is more necessary than in other seasons.\nThus far Mr. Bill, and I hope this paper lent the book containing to Mr. William Scott, of Thorntree, to the Bryan's Leap Forester, when the Marquis of Bute's woods ceeded to verify for himself the experiments detailed. For this purpose pruned several young oaks, which grow near Rowland's Gill, on the 10th with the saw first, and then the edges of the cut were smoothed with a knife, as the case might be, and then applied to the wound a plaster\n\nBELL & SIME,\nDUNDEE.\nLarge Stocks of seasoned Mahogany, Wainscot Flooring, Greenheart, &c.\n\nA. & G.
