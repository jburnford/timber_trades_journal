ON THE PRUNING OF WOOD TREES AND THE WOUNDS OF PRUNING.
(Continued from page 327.)
"On the 22nd of May, 1888, I sawed a few branches from some young oaks, and put dung fresh over the wounds of some of them, exposed, as is common, to the sun, rough edges left by the saw being 11th, in seven weeks, viz., July when I was agreeably surprised to the bark had protruded considerably an inch from each side all round the wound, and a little upon the upper part, while those wounds to which dung had made no progress of consequence, as I could on this occasion on one of the uncovered wounds side; and in September the dung truded considerably more than half an inch from each side, and was growing a little upwards, but still without the bark of the old wood, while those without dung had made but little progress, and there was at all that is visible. I have cut off branches with similar success from fruit trees, but early in the spring was extremely gratified to find the cious and healing qualities of dung tried it upon some large wounds standing to observe how far the wounds have healed in the course of this time, and this has been done trees in general have made great as in some others, and in one of them, and found some of the wounds had increased an inch and a quarter, and three-eighths. From these experiments concerning the efficacy of dung in accelerating the healing of in trees, it appears that it has efficacy the first season, and that at the time, or as soon as possible wounds are made, is the proper time when the young bark is tender, and the wound is complete, and therefore in some kind of covering is more necessary than in other seasons.
Thus far Mr. Bill, and I hope this paper lent the book containing to Mr. William Scott, of Thorntree, to the Bryan's Leap Forester, when the Marquis of Bute's woods ceeded to verify for himself the experiments detailed. For this purpose pruned several young oaks, which grow near Rowland's Gill, on the 10th with the saw first, and then the edges of the cut were smoothed with a knife, as the case might be, and then applied to the wound a plaster
