DUMFRIES.—The Dumfries District Committee have resolved to adopt a water scheme for the parish of Dumfries (excluding the burgh), and portions of the parishes of Caerlaverock, Kirkmahoe, Torthorwald, and Mouswald, which is estimated to cost £29,000. The trustees of the Crichton Royal Institution object to having their estate included in the district of the scheme, on the ground that they had just obtained a supply of their own by means of an artesian well, at an expense of £6,000, and are about to expend from £2,000 to £3,000 more in carrying it by gravitation over the whole of their property.

THE TOP-DRESSING OF CONIFERAE, AND OTHER TREES ON LAWNS.
By D. T. FISH, BURY.
At various periods of the year striking proofs of the evils of the practice of top-dressing are seen in cases equally or more striking than the evils of denuding the roots of the smallest, portion of soil. It is too often forgotten in top-dressing of the roots that the trees have a double operation. The annual growths of the tree grow in checked growth in proportion to the annual and other dressings of the soil, and excreta of birds and other animals, all tend to clothe the trees with surface roots of a lesser depth and inferior quality of these. It is very apt to be overlooked by any cultivator of trees who may notice the slower growth of trees in isolated positions as compared with those in clumps. But the explanation generally is that the disparity has been caused because the trees grow in checked growth in proportion as the woods were top-dressed. It may, however, be but a lesser part of the evil, for the woods were top-dressed, and may have been started on a course worse than this. For the natural top-dressing of the trees on lawns has been forced to please the eye at the expense of the soil. In this there is no replenishment of the soil; the dressings, and an artificial strength to furnish them, result too often because the trees are half or wholly defective and positive in their unhealthy state. Nothing new is found on lawns and pleasure grounds, on, and the little food that is found is to be divided between the surface vegetation. The grass grows so thick as to form an almost impervious covering to the air or water. While this is starving element is added to those already in the food of the plants from the soils from which water and Roots are keen searchers of food; nevertheless, the dunghill itself from which they were excluded.
