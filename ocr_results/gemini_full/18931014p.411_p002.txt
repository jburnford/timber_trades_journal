The debtor attended the meeting, and stated that he was unable to make any offer.

Those instructions had been acted upon, and so far a gross sum of £2,000 had been realised. The furniture had been disposed off for £15, and only the book debts remained to be collected, which it was anticipated would produce a further sum of £120 or £130. He was informed that no prices had been obtained at the sale.
The Court had made an order for summary administration, and the debtor had already been adjudged bankrupt. A general wish being expressed that the Official Receiver should continue to act as trustee, the matter was left in his hands accordingly, the debtor being directed to attend the Court on November 1st for his further examination.
