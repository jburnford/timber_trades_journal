Messrs. Fleming & Barry have two small cargoes of Danzig log timber; Messrs. Donaldson have a cargo of 429 loads battens from Pernoviken for Tayport; while the Hoffnung, from Cronstadt, is discharging 435 loads firewood for Messrs. Jane Saddler, besides 1,200 rickers for Messrs. Fleming & Barry.\nTwo sailing ships have passed up the river for Perth, one with a cargo from Rafso for Messrs. Cameron & Bros., the other with 287 loads white battens and deals, from Swedish port, for Messrs. Henderson & Shaw.\n\nGLASGOW.\nThe imports during the past week have been light, and represent very little addition to yarded stock, most of the goods noted in the list going into consumers' hands ex quay. There are several consignments of Quebec deals, various qualities, per Tritonia (s), which the brokers are having stacked up for sale, also a lot of narrow 1st pine per Manitoban (s), and these parcels will no doubt be held firmly, and should bring good prices in view of the smallness of stocks in first hands and the approaching close of the import season.\nThe inadequacy of the storage room provided by the Clyde Trustees for the timber trade at Glasgow is made very manifest when in a season of moderate imports, such as the present, considerable difficulty is experienced in finding sufficient accommodation. Within the last year or two there have been repeated curtailments of the space at the disposal of the timber trade, and the requirements of the business make it imperative that some additional storage room be provided.\nThe deals per Italia, from Bathurst, which is the only full cargo in the Glasgow list (apart from spoolwood), are for Messrs. Robinson, Dunn, & Co., and are being carted direct to their mills. The Siberian (s) has just arrived, and, along with general cargo, has a consignment of 10,000 Quebec deals, which are being landed on south side of the river; and the Amaryllis (s), from Montreal, is daily expected, and brings several important shipments of deals amounting to about 500 St. Petersburg standards. The Nerito (s), from Baltimore, is also due, her cargo comprising various parcels of wood goods—walnut and whitewood logs, oak and walnut boards, &c. Although the import trade is fast drawing to a close, there is advice of several cargoes of Quebec logs that are yet to come, besides a number of steamers from the comparatively light state of stocks at Greenock there appears good reason for augmenting the supplies.\nDeliveries here continue at a satisfactory rate. The cargo of mahogany recently sold has been moving off rapidly; good-sized mahogany is wanted, and a fair proportion of the cargo comprising this description would find a favourable market.\nThere are no auction sales to report for the past week.\n\nGREENOCK.\nAnother cargo of greenheart has arrived here, per Saga, from Demerara, for Messrs. McLean, Todd, & Co. The quantity of this timber stored here is largely in excess of the\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nstock held at any time for a number of years past. No other timber-laden vessel has come to hand during the week. Imports keep at a very meagre level, which should materially assist the older stocks during the approaching winter months. Consumption proceeds moderately but steadily. Prices keep firm, and a general feeling is beginning to assert itself that prices should, to some extent at least, be advanced, particularly for pitch pine, which now for a considerable time has been simply sacrificed by importers. Yellow pine boardwood, too, should benefit through the scarcity of 1st and 2nd qualities of deals, as these cannot be said to exist in this market, the only deals that have come forward being 3rd and 4th pine and spruce. Allison, Cousland, & Co. announce a public sale here next Thursday.\n\nLEITH.\nSince our last we have to report the following arrivals, viz., the Esperance, from Sundswall, with 11,021 deals and battens; the Hansine, from Memel, with 24,000 oak staves; the Principia (s), from New York, with 4,880 staves; the Moravia (s), from Riga, with 10,646 battens and batten ends and 2,860 pieces lathwood; the Sapphire (s), from Riga, with 9,804 deals and 4,249 pieces lathwood. The Sundswall cargo is for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co., and the others are distributed among various importers.\nThe state of trade calls for no special remark, business moving along quietly but steadily.\nAt the auction held by Mr. D. W. Beattie, on 17th inst., at the Edinburgh Dock, there was an average attendance, the weather being favourable, and a fair quantity of goods changed hands. The goods offered included a cargo of Swedish balks, battens, and boards, and a good deal of time was taken up with this rather miscellaneous consignment, and after all a clearance was not effected, some of the boards and 2 inch scantlings being left on hand. For the sawn balks the average price obtained was about 8½d. per cubic foot, and for the boards, which were mostly narrow widths and all 1 inch thick, prices ranged from 6d. to 6½d. per sup. yard. A varied assortment of deals and battens from both White Sea and Baltic ports were also offered, and a proportion of the various descriptions placed at undernoted prices:—\nPer lin. ft.\n11x3 red deals 3¼d. to 3½d.\n9x3 do. 2½d. to 2¾d.\n6½x2½ red battens 1¼d. to 1½d.\n9x3 white deals 2d. to 2⅛d.\n7x3 white battens, 1½d. to 1⅝d.\n6½x2½ do. 1⅛d. to 1⅜d.\n\nSHIPBUILDING CONTRACT.—Mr. P. Picken, Olderfleet Shipbuilding Yard, Larne, has secured an order for the building of a steel steam-launch for the Newry Canal Company. She will have engines and propellers at either end to obviate the necessity of turning in the narrow waters of the canal. This is the first of a series of similar vessels for the same company, and it is expected the invention will completely do away with horse-power on canals.\n\nNEW VESSELS FOR LIVERPOOL OWNERS.—Messrs. Russell & Co., shipbuilders, Greenock, launched on Monday afternoon a four-masted awning-deck ship of 2,850 tons gross, named the Anconia, built to the order of Messrs. G. T. Soley & Co., Liverpool, for their general trade. Messrs. Fullerton & Co. the same day launched from their yard at Merksworth, Paisley, an iron screw steamer of 400 tons measurement, for Liverpool owners. The vessel was named the Yorkshire.\n\nOct. 11 Vista—Fredriksvoern—8 lds. firewood—C. Ludwig & Co.\n12 Marie—Carlshamn—12 lds. firewood—A. Wilson\n13 August and Eduard—Danzig—346 lds. fir hewn—J.
