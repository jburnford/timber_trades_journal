SELKIRK.—The plan of a hospital proposed to be erected within the burgh at a cost of £800 has been provisionally approved by the Commissioners, subject to the approval of the County Council.

IMPORTANT RAILWAY PROJECT.—A scheme is on foot for the construction of a trunk line to link together by the shortest workable route the three great commercial centres of Manchester, Newcastle, and Glasgow, and to supply railway facilities to large tracts of intervening mineral and other property in England and Scotland at present almost entirely without railway accommodation. The total length of the line will be about 300 miles.

THE HYDROGRAPH.
THE remarkable property possessed by water for conducting sound is well known, but we are not aware that any successful attempt has hitherto been made to turn that property to account for signalling purposes. Its utilisation in that direction, however, seems to have been effected in a practical manner by Captain Neale, who has devised a system, by means of which signals can be given, messages exchanged, and conversations held between ships on the sea or on rivers, whether moving or stationary, or between ships or lighthouses and harbours, forts, or piers on the shore, or vice versa. Communication, moreover, is effected without any connection whatever between the two objects, except the body of water in which the ships float or the lighthouse stands, the water being the sole medium through which the message is transmitted. The system depends for its action upon harmonics, and its principle will be understood by a reference to the well-known fact that, upon a musical note in a given key being sounded, an object capable of emitting sound in the same key will, under certain conditions, sympathetically respond by emitting a sound similar to that which awakened its vibrations. It is, of course, a primary condition that the two objects shall be normally tuned in unison. Working upon this fixed principle, and utilising the high conductivity of water for the transmission of sound, Captain Neale has constructed a signalling apparatus, which consists of a transmitting and a receiving instrument, which, when in operation, are in no way connected with each other, except through the medium of water. The apparatus by which we recently saw the system exemplified, is mounted on two punts, the transmitter on one and the receiver on the other. The transmitter consists of a bell, about 16 in. diameter, attached to the lower end of a framing, which is fixed to the side of the punt, the bell being submerged about 6 ft. At the upper end of the framing is a crank handle, which is worked from the punt and actuates a double-beat hammer, which strikes and sounds the bell. The Morse code is employed and signalling is at present carried on by hand, but electricity is intended to be used. The operator gives the handle a quarter turn for the dots
