In reply to questions, the debtor said he contracted to build a chapel at Clay Cross for £595, and lost considerably by the transaction. He had also lost about £30 in building a new market hall at Clay Cross. The examination was finally ordered to be closed.\n\nBATLEY, W. W.—This debtor, a joiner, of Paddock, came up for examination at Huddersfield on Tuesday. He stated that he was £314 to the bad in August, 1892, and in June of that year he had consulted Messrs. Jere. Kaye & Co., timber merchants, his largest creditors, and, acting on their advice, he sold his stock of furniture and establishment. Just before his failure a gas engine, which he bought of Mr. T. Brook, Folly Hall, agent for Messrs. Crossley Bros., of Manchester, for £200, under a hire-purchase agreement, and on which only the last instalment of £7 was due, was fetched away by Mr. Brook, who was surety for him for £100 to a security a mortgage of a reversionary interest in some property for money lent to him to pay a deposit when he first got the engine. In a similar way a planing machine, which he had bought on the hire-purchase system from Messrs. J. Sutcliffe & Son, wood-cutting machine makers, was fetched away. It cost £85, and about a fourth of the amount was due. Mr. Tom Clifford, clerk to Messrs. J. H. Dransfield, solicitor, said a very different complexion could be put on Mr. Tom Brook's action. The examination was adjourned to the 20th November, and the debtor ordered to file a trading account.\n\nCASLEY, JOHN COURTNEY, cabinetmaker, builder and undertaker, Budleigh Salterton.—This debtor has applied for his discharge at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court. —The Official Receiver explained that in his filed statement debtor estimated his liabilities at £497, whereas proofs had been admitted to the extent of £643. He also put down the assets at £1,059, but they only realised £379, and the dividend was not anticipated to be more than 7s. in the £. Debtor had been in business about eighteen years, his capital at the\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nOCTOBER 21, 1893.\nstart being £400. The failure had undoubtedly been brought about by debtor's building transactions, in respect to several of which he was evidently in error.—His Honour granted the discharge, but suspended its execution for two years. It was, he said, a serious matter when a tradesman did not keep proper books of account.\n\nCHALLENOR & HUGHES, builders, Albert Road, Fenton.—At the meeting of creditors held at Stoke-on-Trent yesterday week, at which creditors representing £1,211 were present, a statement of affairs which had been prepared by Messrs. J. Freeman Dyson & Co., chartered accountants, Leeds and Huddersfield, was presented. After fully discussing the matter, the following gentlemen were appointed a committee to recommend the acceptance of such composition or scheme as may be proposed by the debtors, or failing such composition being offered or accepted, with power to request the debtors to execute a deed of assignment to trustees for the benefit of their creditors :—Messrs. J. Hewitt, Fenton ; E. Peake, Fenton ; Rushton, Longton ; Wilson, Fenton ; John F. Hanfard ; Thomas Minks, Fenton ; John F. Dyson, Leeds ; Jos. H. Scott, Hull. The statement of affairs shows unsecured liabilities at £1,588, and the deficiency at £635. The following are among the creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nBass & Smith, Stoke ... ... ... 25 12 10\nBaxendale & Co, Manchester ... ... 27 12 10\nFarrington H., & Son, Fenton ... ... 60 11 11\nHewitt J., & Co., Fenton ... ... ... 278 18 11\nHordley & Gell, Hanley ... ... ... 31 0 -\nJames & Tatton, Longton ... ... ... 33 8 6\nLavernack & Goddard, Hull ... ... 35 15 6\nMinks Thomas, Fenton ... ... ... 12 8 5\nNorthcote E.

Bullock, Official Receiver, applied for the direction of the Court as to the distribution of the estate of this debtor, who had been twice adjudged bankrupt. Mr. Plumptre appeared for the creditors under the first bankruptcy, and Mr. A. G. Hooper for the creditors under the second bankruptcy.—Mr. Bullock explained that the bankrupt formerly carried on business as a builder and contractor in Hanley. On the 4th May, 1884, a receiving order was made against him, and he was adjudged bankrupt. The assets realised were not sufficient to pay the costs, and consequently no dividend was paid to the creditors, and a balance of £50 remained due to the trustee when he obtained his release in September, 1887. After his bankruptcy, he commenced jobbing work in a small way, and his business increasing, he commenced about four or five years ago to take contracts for new buildings. It was not known whether the trustee, prior to obtaining his release, was aware of the bankrupt having commenced to trade again ; but the Official Receiver, in whom, on the trustee's release, any future assets would rest, was altogether ignorant of the fact. On the 11th May last the bankrupt executed a deed of assignment, and on the 11th July he was again adjudged bankrupt upon a creditor's petition. No trustee had been appointed, and the estate was being realised by the Official Receiver. It was estimated that after paying the costs of the bankruptcy and preferential claims, about £580 would remain for distribution amongst the creditors. It had been arranged that the Official Receiver should apply for the directions of the Court as to the whether (1) the creditors in the first bankruptcy ; (2) the creditors in the second bankruptcy ; or (3) the creditors in both bankruptcies were to be paid.\nAfter a long legal argument, His Honour said that according to the decision in ex parte Ford re Caughey and other cases heard in the Court of Appeal, it was his duty to say that the assets vested in the trustee under the first adjudication and direct that he must first satisfy the creditors under the first bankruptcy, and that if any surplus remained it must be distributed amongst the second set of creditors. In reply to the Official Receiver, his Honour said the question of how the costs of the second bankruptcy were to be paid did not come before him that day, and he declined to make any order in that matter.\n\nELLIOT, GEORGE, builder and contractor, Newsham, near Blyth.—At the Newcastle Bankruptcy Court on the 13th inst., the discharge of the above debtor was suspended for two years.\n\nHUNT, EDWARD, builder, Hull.—The\n\nOCTOBER 21, 1893.\nadjourned public examination of this debtor was concluded at the Hull Bankruptcy Court on Monday last. It appeared that the debtor, at his previous examination, had stated that he had executed certain deeds for a Mr. Eccles, another builder, and had not received any money from him. The debtor, in reply to Mr. McLaughlan, who appeared for Mr. Eccles, said he had not received certain large sums of money from Mr. Eccles. Afterwards the debtor said he could not say for certain one way or the other. Mr. McLaughlan commented upon what he termed the debtor's prevarication, and said there was not a word of truth in the debtor's allegations, and they would be prepared to prove so at some future time. The examination was then ordered to be closed.\n\nJONES, JAMES, builder, Mountain Ash. —The adjourned public examination of this debtor took place on Monday last at the Aberdare County Court. The debtor, in reply to questions put by the Official Receiver, said that he had paid away a sum of money to cover the charges of the solicitor and the auctioneer in the sale of some property, the mortgagee having sold the property. The debtor was then questioned at considerable length with respect to his transactions with a Mr. Phillips, a solicitor's clerk, from which it appeared that the debtor had received several sums of money on houses he had built from Mr. Phillips. The money was advanced as the houses progressed, and there was no special arrangement as to interest. Mr. Phillips here stated that in the district it was the practice to charge the full amount of interest on progressive mortgages from the date of the first instalment. The Registrar and the Official Receiver both repudiated that statement. The debtor, in the course of further examination, said other persons who had advanced him money had adopted the same practice. The examination was eventually adjourned in order that the debtor might be enabled to file particulars of the mortgages he had received and how they were paid, and the amount of interest paid on each mortgage.\n\nKNUDSEN BROTHERS & CO., timber agents, 25, Wormwood Street, E.C.—A sitting for public examination was held under this failure on Tuesday before Mr. Registrar Linklater. The Assistant Receiver, Mr. Chapman, however, stated that the accounts had only just been lodged, and that an adjournment was therefore necessary. Mr. Street, appearing for the trustee, concurred, and the examination was adjourned accordingly.\n\nLILBURN, WILLIAM, builder, Waterloo, Blyth.—The discharge of this debtor was suspended for four months, at the Newcastle Bankruptcy Court, on Friday last, by his honour, Judge Seymour.\n\nNEAL, THOMAS WILLIAM, builder, 80, Kelmscott Road, Wandsworth.—The first meeting of the creditors under this failure took place on Wednesday, at the offices of the Official Receiver, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E. The debtor's statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £6,295 5s. 10d., of which £820 5s. 10d. was due to unsecured creditors, and £1,070 5s. 10d. was expected to rank against the estate for dividend. Assets, nil. The receiving order was made on a creditors petition, and orders of adjudication and for the summary administration of the estate have been made. The debtor commenced business in May, 1890, with a capital of about £15, and in March last when in debt to about the same extent as at present, and with no assets except certain equities which he considered valueless, he went into partnership with a Mr. Caine, which partnership continued until the date of the receiving order, when he alleges that he ceased to be a partner by mutual arrangement with Mr. Caine, who took over all assets and liabilities of the firm. He attributes his insolvency to want of capital, and being unable to realise his equities, and states that he became aware of his position in August, 1892, but in the deficiency account he shows himself as just solvent a year before the receiving order. He states that he has kept no books of account except a bill book, and that he has not gone into his affairs at any time during the past three years. The fully and partly secured creditors appear to hold charges on a number of freehold and leasehold houses at Cricklewood, and among the partly secured creditors is the debtor's wife, who holds an assignment of the debtor's interest in two of these houses given in January last, and valued at £385, in respect of £58 advanced from 1890 to January, 1893. The circumstances under which these moneys were advanced and the value of the debtor's interest in the partnership are matters for inquiry. As the debtor was unable to make a satisfactory offer of composition, it was decided to leave the matter in the hands of the Official Receiver.",
