TRADE REPORTS.

DUNDEE.
Local trade continues quiet, although quite up to expectation considering the depression experienced in the staple industry, but orders from the more outlying districts, which this centre to some extent depends on, are still being placed to a degree which has kept up deliveries fairly well, while prices are more than maintained, an advance in Baltic goods being already apparent although slight.
The only important arrival since our last is a pitch pine cargo of 1,200 loads sawn timber and 36 standards boards and deals divided between Messrs. Cameron Bros., Perth, and Messrs. Bell & Sime, Limited, Dundee, while the latter firm has also a large parcel of Oregon pine deckwood per steamer Coastwise from Glasgow. Messrs. Bell & Sime, Ltd., hold their first sale as advertised at their Dundee Saw-mills, and the attractive catalogue will doubtless draw a large company.

GLASGOW.
Deliveries here continue at a steady rate, although for some time past public sales by brokers have not been at all frequent, and what is moving off is chiefly the result of private selling, and indicates a healthy activity of demand.
The Yorkhill deliveries of deals amount, since the beginning of September, to about 190,000 pieces, besides which there are the deliveries from other places of storage near the harbour which have to be used owing to the crowded state of Yorkhill yard.
There has been no auction sale held by brokers at Glasgow for the past two weeks, but one is announced for 31st inst., when, as advertised by Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co., an important sale of deals is to take place at Yorkhill Wharf.
The City Saw-mills' public sales of pine boards, deals, &c., may generally be taken as affording a reliable indication of the state of the trade, and it is satisfactory to note that the sale there, by Brownlee & Co. on the 25th inst., brought together a good company, notwithstanding the extremely wet weather, and a very fair amount of business was done.
The arrival-list since last writing, includes the Amarynthia (s) with various important consignments of Quebec deals (amounting to about 34,000 pieces) and among the more recent arrivals is the Columbia, from Halifax, N.S., with a full cargo, consisting chiefly of spruce deals, which are being yarded at Yorkhill. Messrs. Wright, Graham & Co., and on the south side of river the Pomeranian (s) has discharged a pretty large lot of Quebec deals (1st and 3rd quality pine) for Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells, storage for which is being found near Cessnock Dock. We learn there is an extensive piece of ground about the same locality being available for the use of the timber trade by the Trustees, which there is the prospect of having for the use of the timber trade by the time the next import season comes round. This will be specially suitable for goods discharged on south side.

LEITH.
There has been a fair average importation of wood goods during the past week, the arrivals consisting of 11,176 deals and battens per Tronda (s), from Drontheim, for Messrs. Garland & Roger ; 6,754 deals per Midwolda, from Soderhamn ; 9,193 deals and battens per Carolina, also from Soderhamn ; and 11,620 battens per Bravo, from Hernosand, all for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. ; 114½ fathoms firewood per Jenny, from Hernosand, for Messrs. Forslind & Rex ; 6,732 pit props and 16,084 deals per Petersburg (s), from Cronstadt and Riga ; 48 poplar logs, 14 walnut logs, 132 hickory logs, per Alma (s), from Baltimore, the last two shipments being divided among various importers.
With the advancing season there is, as usual, a tendency towards curtailment in the amount of business, but for the end of October there is a fair delivery of goods going on, and prospects on the whole are not unfavourable to better prices being got by and by.

GREENOCK.
Two steamers have arrived during the week, both from Quebec, with assorted timber cargoes. They are the Garnet for Singleton, Dunn, & Co.and Robinson, Dunn, & Co. and the Europa for Singleton, Dunn & Co. and McDowall & Neilson. A cargo of pitch pine has also arrived from Mobile per sailer Kentyern for Wright, Graham, & Co. The Garnet experienced a stormy passage, and reports having passed a large quantity of deals which appeared to be only a short time in the water. The course of business remains unchanged. A moderate, but not large, business is being done at prices which are maintained at a very steady level by the restricted rate of importation ; this is so far satisfactory, and will facilitate the realisation of the older log timber stocks. The little spurt in shipbuilding orders experienced some time ago seems to have fizzled out, and just now there is quite a dearth of fresh orders in this department.
Allison, Cousland, & Co. held an auction sale here on the 26th inst., of which the details will appear in our next issue.
