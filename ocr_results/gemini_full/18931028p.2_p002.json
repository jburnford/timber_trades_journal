A. D. WEBSTER, the superintendent of the Duke of Bedford's woodlands, has written a very interesting illustrated article for the Gardeners' Chronicle of September 23rd, from which we give the following extracts:-\"Surely these are greatly on the increase in this country. During the past fortnight I have visited large extents of woodland in at least three of the south-midland counties, Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire, and in every instance the same question has been asked me, \"What remedy can you suggest to lessen the depredations of these injurious insects?\" No coniferous tree would seem to escape, each one having some particular insect or fungoid pest that renders whole woods unfitted for any economic or ornamental purpose. The Scotch pine suffers severely from the ravages of that dread insect, the pine-beetle, \"Hylurgus piniperda.\" The spruce is being killed out or rendered very unsightly from the attacks of the Pineapple-gall or Spruce-gall (\"Chermes abietis\"); while the larch is being killed wholesale in many woods by the larch-canker, which is due to the minute fungus, \"Peziza Wilkommii.\" But this is not all, for the deadly insect \"Liparis monacha\" has likewise made its appearance, and others of quite as destructive propensities have, during the past unusually dry summer, been detected, in no small quantities. \"Tomicus typographus,\" \"Pissodes Pini,\" and \"P. rotatus have\" also been recognised, and several others are under examination. The pine-beetle is present, indeed, to such an extent that acres of young Scotch fir are either completely killed out or crippled to such an extent that their future value is hardly worthy of consideration. Young trees, of course, suffer most; but after the age of, say, twenty to twenty-five years the attacks are less persistent, probably owing to the shorter and more mature growth of the trees.\nI feel confident that in Bedfordshire, at least, the great increase of this particular beetle can be attributed solely either to neglect or want of knowledge of the life-history",
