The bankrupt was formerly a builder at Southend. The Official Receiver's report showed that the statement of affairs showed liabilities expected to rank for dividend £45 15s. 9½d.—From the Official Receiver's observations it appeared that in 1886 the bankrupt was engaged by a Mr. Walter Sweet, who was then carrying on a builder's business at Southend, which had previously belonged to the bankrupt. In that year the business was made over to the bankrupt, who continued to trade till 1888, when he was unable to meet his engagements. He then executed a deed of assignment for the benefit of his creditors. The liabilities were £267 17s. 9d., and the assets £26 1s. 8d. The bankrupt was granted his discharge in December, 1888, when he paid 30s. per week so long as the business allowed it. He had since worked as a journeyman carpenter. The bankrupt attributed his failure to bad debts and want of capital. The examination was closed.\nBETTLESWORTH, GEORGE (trading as G. Mears & Co.), builder and contractor.—This failure occurred in July last, when the debtor was bankrupt applied to Mr. Registrar Giffard for his order of discharge. The liabilities expected to rank for dividend were £1,412 4s. 7d, and the assets were estimated at £202 16s. 1d., leaving a deficiency of £6 8s 5d. The bankrupt, who was a joiner by trade, stated that he commenced business as a builder in 1886, with a capital of £130, and had traded as G. Mears & Co. Since 1889 he had built houses, mostly under contract, in Clapton, Willesden, and Harringay Gate. He attributed his failure to building speculations. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had continued to trade after he knew himself to be insolvent, that he had contracted debts in 1886, when he paid his creditors 10s. in the pound to his creditors, that he had brought on his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculations, and that he had put a creditor to unnecessary expense by a frivolous defence. He had also failed to keep proper books of account. The Official Receiver's report, said his Honour, was a very bad one, and the discharge would be suspended for four years.\nBIRCH & ASHBY, builders, Higher Openshaw.—The creditors of Alfred Ashby, trading as Birch & Ashby, are—\nAllen, T.
