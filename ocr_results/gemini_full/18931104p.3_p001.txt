A public sale was held by Mr. D. W. Beattie on Tuesday, 31st ult., at Edinburgh Dock, at which a varied assortment of deals, battens, and boards was offered; but the attendance of buyers was under the average, and the quantity of goods disposed of correspondingly restricted.
There was no change in prices, for, although no improvement can be recorded, there was no disposition to accept lower rates.
