Laird & Son, wrights, cabinetmakers, and contractors, in Ann Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow. The flames had reached the second storey of a large three-storey block when the central brigade arrived, but there was a plentiful supply of water, and the outbreak was speedily checked. The loss is covered by insurance.\n\nACTION AGAINST TIMBER MERCHANTS.—In the Aberdeen Sheriff Court the record was closed in an action at the instance of Duncan Mackenzie, 20, James Street, Aberdeen, and Duncan Mackenzie, sen., his father, who sue Messrs. J. Rust & Son, timber merchants, Footdee Sawmills, York Street, Aberdeen, for £100, on account of injuries sustained by the younger pursuer through, as the pursuers allege, a fault of the defenders or of their workmen. The pursuers case is that the defenders, through their servants, piled timber which they were receiving off the steamship State of Georgia to a height of 5 or 6 feet, and that, in consequence of the instability of the pile, the battens fell on the lad Mackenzie, who had his leg broken. The defenders hold that the timber was securely piled, and was only brought down by the interference of the boy Mackenzie and his companions. The injured lad is nine years of age. Mr. A. J. Brander, solicitor, is agent for the pursuers, and Mr. Duffus, advocate, acts for the defenders.\n\nW. M.

The large forests have another cause, and it is that they were removed because they afforded shelter to the Irish rebels.\nThe Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland for the last quarter contains a paper by Mr. T. P. Le Fanu on the \"Royal Forest of Glencree,\" from which we take the following remarks on the ancient state of forestry in Ireland:—\nEven so early as the twelfth century the Irish oak forests had been much encroached on, as is shown by the request for a grant of Irish timber made by William of Malmesbury, for the roof of the building of his monastery. In the time of Giraldus Cambrensis the woods had been reduced in his time had extended over what was then open ground.\nIn the time of Henry II. the passion for the chase reached its height. The Norman conqueror went about it with a high hand and force; and, not content with the royal forests, thus afforded the barons an excuse for enclosing the demense lands of their manors, which they claimed and exercised the same rights as the king in the possessions of their less powerful of their subjects.\nThe forest laws, however, were a source of burning political questions, and that being so, it is not surprising that they did not soon as a firm foot in the then disturbed state of Ireland, a royal forest was established in that country. For this purpose the counties of Wicklow, and especially the part of them lying nearest to Dublin, were the best suited, both by nature and position.\nThese woods, like the English forests, consisted principally of oak. Sir George Carew, in a letter to the Privy Council, written in 1590, notices the excellence of the oak in Ireland; and as a proof of the value set upon it, an establishment of shipwrights was maintained at the time of the Spanish Armada. In this letter it is mentioned that timber for shipping might easily be obtained from the woods of Ireland, and ash, of course, was plentiful in Ireland, but to nothing like the same extent as oak.\nThese oak trees, besides their value as timber, supply of food for the swine, and the acorns of the holly (which, in the absence of other food, the evergreens we now cultivate) were also eaten. It had a place in the forest laws, and in the Brehon laws of the 20s. was laid down as the value of a full-grown holly, its name to the place where it grew.\n\nB[?]\nDUN[?]\nLarge Stocks of Wainscot Floori[?]\nG[?]\n\nA.\nWOOD M[?]\nY[?]\n\nCAM[?]\nTI[?]\nPERT[?]",
