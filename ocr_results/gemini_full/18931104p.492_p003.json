Burton, Yeates, & Hart, a receiving order was made under a creditor's petition.\nThe assets consist of book debts to the value of about £150, and some leasehold property in apartments at Fulham, and that the liabilities did not transpire.\nThe debtor states that he resides in apartments at Fulham, and that the furniture belongs to his wife.\nThe amount of the liabilities did not transpire.\nGRIFFITHS, DAVID, builder, Gilli-wastad Road, Pontypridd. The statutory meeting of the creditors under this failure took place on Thursday week, at the offices of the Official Receiver, Merthyr.\nThe statement of affairs showed liabilities amount-ing to £11,792 1s. 7d., of which £3,045 0s. 3d. was expected to rank against the estate for dividend.\nThe fully secured creditors were returned at £6,355, and the partly-secured creditors at £7,484 11s. 5d.\nThe assets, after deducting the claims of the preferential creditors, amounted to £112 18s 11d., were returned at £6,987 3s.\nThe debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through losses in building villas, illness, pressure by cre-ditors, heavy bank charges, and court fees.\nThe estate will be wound up in the usual way.\nHAM, GEORGE, builder and contractor, Church Court and Holland Street, Kensington, W.—The debtor has filed his petition, and on Monday, upon the application of Messrs Hicks & Son, the usual receiving order was made.\nThe assets were stated to consist of stock, plant, and mate-rials to the value of about £75,\n\nand book debts £140; and furniture £30.\nThere was also a contract for £150 on hand.\nThe Sheriff of London was stated to be in posses-sion.\nThe amount of the liabilities was not given.\nHAMMERTON & WHITE, builders, Winchester.—These bankrupts attended at the Winchester Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Godwin for their public examination.\nMr J Moberly, Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, Mr. Clay represented the trustee, Mr. Romney appeared for the creditors, and Mr. R. Harris appeared for the bankrupts.\nThe bankrupts said that they commenced business in 1888 with a joint capital of £250, and they had been engaged in specu-lative building.\nIn 1891 they had a loss, but the only assets were equities in their property, and according to their statement of affairs the deficiency amounted to £1,200, but they admitted that this would be reduced by as the equities they possessed, and which they had estimated then in their statement of affairs.\nEventually, there being no opposition, the bankrupts were allowed to pass their public examination.\nHARRISON & BRASS, coachbuilders, Elgin.—The following are creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nElsworth, John & Sons, 9, Commerce Street, Glasgow ... 25 18 10\nGilmour & Aitken, 10, Stanley Place, Eglinton Street, Glasgow ... 58 17 0\nHopton, George & Co, Ltd., Manchester ... 12 16 8\nHopton & Sons, King's Cross, London ... 19 19 8\nHopton & Sons, 67, George Street, Euston Square, London, W.C. ... 59 12 9\nJapp, J, & V, Timber Merchants, Montrose ... 25 13 7\nOscar, Windebeck, Merchant, Monmouth Place, Bath ... 21 [?] [?]\nRoe's Timber Co., Ltd, Siddals' Road Derby ... 30 [?] [?]\nWhittingham & Wilkin, 136, Long Acre, London, W.C. ... 34 [?] [?]\nHOOD, A., builder and contractor, Crown Works, Bethnal Green Road, E.—The failure occurred in October, 1892, and the bank-rupt applied last week to Mr. Registrar Link-later for his order of discharge.\nThe Official Receiver reported that proofs had been made for £1,083 7s. 2d, and that the assets realised £88 7s. 9d.\nThe bankrupt commenced business in 1880 with about £250 capital, at Cambridge Road, Bethnal Green, removing in 1885 to 471, Bethnal Green Road, where he continued to trade down to or within a short time of the receiving order.\nThe Official Receiver alleged, as offences, that the assets were not equal to 10s. in the pound on the amount of his unsecured debts; and that the bankrupt had continued to trade after knowing himself to be insolvent.\nHis Honour suspended the discharge for two years.\nLEWIS, JOHN, builder, 4, Laurel Cottages, Clydach Vale, Rhondda Vale, Glamorganshire.—The summary of this debtor's statement of affairs disclose liabilities to un-secured creditors of £873 7s 5d. ; creditors fully secured, £256 6s. ; estimated value of security, £260; balance, therefore, to contra, £3 14s.; total, £873 7s 5d.\nThe net assets to £873 7s 5d. deficiency, £827 14s. 4d.\nThe debtor alleges the cause of failure to be \"taking contracts at too low a price, and consequent loss.\"\nThe Official Receiver's observations are: The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition.\nHe commenced business about three years ago with a capital of £50.\nThe only account books he has kept are ledgers, showing accounts with his creditors and debtors.\nThe following are the creditors:—\nBland & Co., Cardiff ... £39 17 6\nDavies, J. R., Cardiff ... 20 0 0\nEvans, Robert, Penygraig ... 62 0 0\nGlamorgan Steam Joinery Co., Llantrissant ... 20 16 5\nJenkins & Sons, Porth ... 42 17 3\nLondon, Thomas, Bettwsycoed ... 50 0 0\nLewis, William, Lwynypandy ... 40 0 0\nMackay, John, Newport ... 308 [?] [?]\nMorris & Smith, Cardiff ... 21 [?] [?]\nRobinson, David, & Co., Cardiff ... 80 17 7\nWilson & Co., Cardiff ... 23 6 7\nOLDS, BROTHERS, builders, &c., Wilson Street, Finsbury, and Finsbury Avenue, E.C. The bankrupts failed in September, 1887, and they applied on Friday to Mr. Registrar Linklater for their discharge.\nThe ranking liabilities were returned at £932 10s. against assets £154, and a dividend of 1s. 7d. in the pound has been paid to the creditors.\nThe bankrupts commenced business in 1879 without capital, and in 1885 they assigned their estate to a trustee to secure a composition of 10s. in the pound, of which, however, only 7s. 6d. was paid.\nThe Official Receiver reported as offences, that the bankrupts had continued to trade after knowing themselves to be insolvent, and the previous compositions arrangement.\nHis Honour having regard to the fact that the receiving order was made so long ago as September, 1887, granted the discharge subject to a nominal suspension of three weeks.\nSMITHER'S, S., timber merchant and saw mill proprietor, 92, Leonard Street, and Ravey Street, Shoreditch, E. The debtor also traded as of 9, Albion Road, Islington.\nThe examination, held on Wednesday last, was adjourned.\nAn order was made by Mr. Registrar Linklater.\nThe assets were estimated at £1,000.\nThe amount of the liabilities was not given.\nThe adjudication of bankruptcy was also made.\n\nTHE UNIVERSAL BARREL COMPANY (LIMITED).\nA winding-up order having been made against this company, a statement of affairs is furnished, accompanied by the observations of the Official Receiver (Mr. C. G. Stapylton Barnes).\nThe liabilities are returned at £5,642, of which £788 is unsecured, the whole of the assets being covered by debenture bonds.\nThe total deficiency as regards contributories is £27,451.\nThe company was registered on September 6th, 1888, and was formed to acquire and develop certain inventions relating to the manufacture of barrels, boxes, cases, &c., from pulp, patents for which had been obtained, or applied for, in various parts of the world.\nIt would appear from the prospectus that the company was formed for experimental purposes, it being proposed that at a later date it should become a parent company, granting licenses to subsidiary companies or firms.\nThe nominal capital of the company was £20,000 in shares of £1 each.\nOf these 19,607 have been issued—viz., to the vendors as fully paid, 11,000; to cash subscribers, 8,607.\nThe company had registered offices at Dashwood House, New Broad Street, E.C., and carried on business at Two Waters Mill, Box-moor, Herts.\nThe Official Receiver asserts that the directors proceeded to allotment on a sub-scription of £1,500 only.\nOn May 7th, 1889, a fire occurred at the mill, which necessitated almost the entire rebuilding of the pre-mises, and from that date to the beginning of March, 1890, the company's operations appear to have been practically at a standstill.\nVery little business beyond experimental work appears to have been carried on by the com-pany.\nThe Secretary considers the failure of the company is due to want of working capital.\nThe directors attribute it to insufficient capital to enlarge the mill (after the experimental stage had been passed through) so as to enable the company to carry on the manufacture of barrels on a sufficiently large scale.\nThey further attribute it to want of working capital and to loss sustained owing to the operations of the company being suspended for nearly a year through the fire which occurred at the mill.\nThe Official Receiver states that the books of the company appear to have been properly kept.\nThe first meetings of the creditors and shareholders of this company were held yesterday week, at Carey Street, W.C., before Mr. A. S. Cully, Assistant Receiver.\nThe chairman reported that the company was formed in September, 1888, to acquire and develop certain inventions relating to the manu-facture of barrels, boxes, &c., from pulp.\nThe accounts showed unsecured debts £5,649, out of a total indebtedness of £7,846, and against that the assets were valued at £788, but, inas-much as they were all covered by debentures, there was apparently nothing available for the unsecured creditors.\nThe account with the contributories showed a deficiency of £27,451.\nThe deficiency account showed that, whilst the gross sales of the business only amounted to £880, and the stock in hand, at the date of the winding-up order, was only valued at £160, a sum of £3,406 was expended in stores and materials, and the company had paid out £4,903 in salaries and wages.\nThe contract for the purchase of the patents had not been carried through; consequently the patents had reverted to the vendors.\nMr. E. H. D'Avigdor, a director, explained that the difference in the purchases and sales was due to the fact that the company was distinctly an experimental one.\nDuring the first two years the experiments were not crowned with success, and the goods manufac-tured proved to be failures and unsaleable.\nFurther, thousands of barrels were given away as samples.\nIt was true that the directors went to allotment on a subscription of £1,500, but they undertook—and had since carried out such undertaking to take up nearly the whole of the share capital.\nInstead of drawing any money out of the company for salaries or fees, they had invested considerable sums in the business with a view to helping it forward.\nFor the in-formation of the creditors he begged to state that negotiations were pending for the recon-struction of the company, and the contributories of the business, and if those steps were carried out a substantial sum would be paid to the other creditors as soon as possible.\nOn the other hand, if the effects were sacrificed the creditors would get absolutely nothing.\nResolutions were passed for the Official Receiver to act as liqui-dator, with the assistance of a committee of inspection.\n\nFLO\nO\nS",
