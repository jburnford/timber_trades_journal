FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
CLARKE, JOB THOMAS, late builder and contractor, Darley Dale.—This debtor was charged, at the Darley Police Court on Friday, with having obtained credit from Messrs Dickinson & Sons, saw mill proprietors and contractors, of Darley, without informing them that he was an un-discharged bankrupt, did not disclose the fact.
Upon it being stated that the only witness for the prosecution was not present, Mr. Baddeley who appeared on the defen-dant's behalf, said the case was a breach of one of the provisions of the Bank-ruptcy Act of a highly technical nature, and of which he knew nothing.
Under these circum-stances Mr Baddeley asked for bail; this the Bench granted, the defendant in £20 and one surety for the same amount.
FAULKNER, ALBERT E., builder and contractor, 9, Apple Tree Yard, St James's.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Hope, on Friday, and upon the application of Messrs. Burton, Yeates, & Hart, a receiving order was made under a creditor's petition.
The assets consist of book debts to the value of about £150, and some leasehold property in apartments at Fulham, and that the liabilities did not transpire.
The debtor states that he resides in apartments at Fulham, and that the furniture belongs to his wife.
The amount of the liabilities did not transpire.
GRIFFITHS, DAVID, builder, Gilli-wastad Road, Pontypridd. The statutory meeting of the creditors under this failure took place on Thursday week, at the offices of the Official Receiver, Merthyr.
The statement of affairs showed liabilities amount-ing to £11,792 1s. 7d., of which £3,045 0s. 3d. was expected to rank against the estate for dividend.
The fully secured creditors were returned at £6,355, and the partly-secured creditors at £7,484 11s. 5d.
The assets, after deducting the claims of the preferential creditors, amounted to £112 18s 11d., were returned at £6,987 3s.
The debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through losses in building villas, illness, pressure by cre-ditors, heavy bank charges, and court fees.
The estate will be wound up in the usual way.
HAM, GEORGE, builder and contractor, Church Court and Holland Street, Kensington, W.—The debtor has filed his petition, and on Monday, upon the application of Messrs Hicks & Son, the usual receiving order was made.
The assets were stated to consist of stock, plant, and mate-rials to the value of about £75,

and book debts £140; and furniture £30.
There was also a contract for £150 on hand.
The Sheriff of London was stated to be in posses-sion.
The amount of the liabilities was not given.
HAMMERTON & WHITE, builders, Winchester.—These bankrupts attended at the Winchester Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Godwin for their public examination.
Mr J Moberly, Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, Mr. Clay represented the trustee, Mr. Romney appeared for the creditors, and Mr. R. Harris appeared for the bankrupts.
The bankrupts said that they commenced business in 1888 with a joint capital of £250, and they had been engaged in specu-lative building.
In 1891 they had a loss, but the only assets were equities in their property, and according to their statement of affairs the deficiency amounted to £1,200, but they admitted that this would be reduced by as the equities they possessed, and which they had estimated then in their statement of affairs.
Eventually, there being no opposition, the bankrupts were allowed to pass their public examination.

The ranking liabilities were returned at £932 10s. against assets £154, and a dividend of 1s. 7d. in the pound has been paid to the creditors.
The bankrupts commenced business in 1879 without capital, and in 1885 they assigned their estate to a trustee to secure a composition of 10s. in the pound, of which, however, only 7s. 6d. was paid.
The Official Receiver reported as offences, that the bankrupts had continued to trade after knowing themselves to be insolvent, and the previous compositions arrangement.
His Honour having regard to the fact that the receiving order was made so long ago as September, 1887, granted the discharge subject to a nominal suspension of three weeks.

The assets were estimated at £1,000.
The amount of the liabilities was not given.
The adjudication of bankruptcy was also made.

THE UNIVERSAL BARREL COMPANY (LIMITED).
A winding-up order having been made against this company, a statement of affairs is furnished, accompanied by the observations of the Official Receiver (Mr. C. G. Stapylton Barnes).
The liabilities are returned at £5,642, of which £788 is unsecured, the whole of the assets being covered by debenture bonds.
The total deficiency as regards contributories is £27,451.
The company was registered on September 6th, 1888, and was formed to acquire and develop certain inventions relating to the manufacture of barrels, boxes, cases, &c., from pulp, patents for which had been obtained, or applied for, in various parts of the world.
It would appear from the prospectus that the company was formed for experimental purposes, it being proposed that at a later date it should become a parent company, granting licenses to subsidiary companies or firms.
The nominal capital of the company was £20,000 in shares of £1 each.
Of these 19,607 have been issued—viz., to the vendors as fully paid, 11,000; to cash subscribers, 8,607.
The company had registered offices at Dashwood House, New Broad Street, E.C., and carried on business at Two Waters Mill, Box-moor, Herts.
The Official Receiver asserts that the directors proceeded to allotment on a sub-scription of £1,500 only.
On May 7th, 1889, a fire occurred at the mill, which necessitated almost the entire rebuilding of the pre-mises, and from that date to the beginning of March, 1890, the company's operations appear to have been practically at a standstill.
Very little business beyond experimental work appears to have been carried on by the com-pany.
The Secretary considers the failure of the company is due to want of working capital.
The directors attribute it to insufficient capital to enlarge the mill (after the experimental stage had been passed through) so as to enable the company to carry on the manufacture of barrels on a sufficiently large scale.
They further attribute it to want of working capital and to loss sustained owing to the operations of the company being suspended for nearly a year through the fire which occurred at the mill.
The Official Receiver states that the books of the company appear to have been properly kept.
The first meetings of the creditors and shareholders of this company were held yesterday week, at Carey Street, W.C., before Mr. A. S. Cully, Assistant Receiver.
The chairman reported that the company was formed in September, 1888, to acquire and develop certain inventions relating to the manu-facture of barrels, boxes, &c., from pulp.
The accounts showed unsecured debts £5,649, out of a total indebtedness of £7,846, and against that the assets were valued at £788, but, inas-much as they were all covered by debentures, there was apparently nothing available for the unsecured creditors.
The account with the contributories showed a deficiency of £27,451.
The deficiency account showed that, whilst the gross sales of the business only amounted to £880, and the stock in hand, at the date of the winding-up order, was only valued at £160, a sum of £3,406 was expended in stores and materials, and the company had paid out £4,903 in salaries and wages.
The contract for the purchase of the patents had not been carried through; consequently the patents had reverted to the vendors.
Mr. E. H. D'Avigdor, a director, explained that the difference in the purchases and sales was due to the fact that the company was distinctly an experimental one.
During the first two years the experiments were not crowned with success, and the goods manufac-tured proved to be failures and unsaleable.
Further, thousands of barrels were given away as samples.
It was true that the directors went to allotment on a subscription of £1,500, but they undertook—and had since carried out such undertaking to take up nearly the whole of the share capital.
Instead of drawing any money out of the company for salaries or fees, they had invested considerable sums in the business with a view to helping it forward.
For the in-formation of the creditors he begged to state that negotiations were pending for the recon-struction of the company, and the contributories of the business, and if those steps were carried out a substantial sum would be paid to the other creditors as soon as possible.
On the other hand, if the effects were sacrificed the creditors would get absolutely nothing.
Resolutions were passed for the Official Receiver to act as liqui-dator, with the assistance of a committee of inspection.
