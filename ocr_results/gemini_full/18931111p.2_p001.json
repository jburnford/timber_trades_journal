The competition throughout was altogether very satisfactory, the goods put up without reserve bringing very good prices, and sales to a considerable amount were also made from the other portion of the catalogue, that was not put up absolutely without reserve.\nThere have been few arrivals since last writing, and little addition to yarded stock. The cargo of Bathurst, N.B., pine deals, per Orontes, for Messrs. Brownlee & Co., is being carted direct to their mills; the Indrani (s), from Montreal, has just arrived, and brings some pretty large consignments of deals—10,984 pieces for Singleton, Dunn, & Co., 12,231 pieces for Allison, Cousland, & Co., and 880 pieces for F.

The demand maintains itself at a moderate level and the deliveries proceed in a corresponding manner. The following cargoes have arrived since our last issue, viz., the Alice, from Quebec, for Allison, Cousland, & Co. and McDowell & Neil; the Fremad, from Cronstadt, with battens for James McLean & Co.; and the steamer Somorostro, from Pensacola, with pitch pine for F.
