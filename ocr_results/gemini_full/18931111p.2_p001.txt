GLASGOW.
The shipments may now be considered as practically closed for the season, and the Canadian timber stocks on Clyde will be much short of many preceding years. Prices keep firm, with a hardening tendency for some of the scarcer goods.
Singleton, Dunn, & Co. held an auction sale at Prince's Pier on the 9th inst. We shall publish the details next week.
The list of arrivals for the past week is a short one, consisting of 497 pieces lumber, per Gerona (s), from Montreal; 5,400 staves, per Abana (s), from New York; 19,732 deals and battens, 827 pitprops, and 1,094 pieces lathwood, per Czar, from Cronstadt.
There has been no public sale here this week, the municipal elections falling on Tuesday, the usual auction day. As usual about term time, the tendency is towards increased quietness, and there are no public sales announced, the feeling among importers being to hold their goods for higher prices than have been going lately at auction.

attractive feature in the catalogue being the large proportion put up without reserve, comprising a number of lots of 1st and 2nd qualities Quebec pine deals of varied dimensions; and it was evident that the prominent intimation of so many desirable lots to be offered without reserve, had good effect in increasing the attendance—country as well as local buyers being largely represented—and of imparting more animation than usual to the proceedings.
Of the 1st qualities pine deals, the sales made were about 10,000 pieces, and of the 2nd qualities about 5,000 pieces; they were to a large extent broad deals, as will be seen from the particulars given below. The competition throughout was altogether very satisfactory, the goods put up without reserve bringing very good prices, and sales to a considerable amount were also made from the other portion of the catalogue, that was not put up absolutely without reserve.
There have been few arrivals since last writing, and little addition to yarded stock. The cargo of Bathurst, N.B., pine deals, per Orontes, for Messrs. Brownlee & Co., is being carted direct to their mills; the Indrani (s), from Montreal, has just arrived, and brings some pretty large consignments of deals—10,984 pieces for Singleton, Dunn, & Co., 12,231 pieces for Allison, Cousland, & Co., and 880 pieces for F. A. Lightbody.
