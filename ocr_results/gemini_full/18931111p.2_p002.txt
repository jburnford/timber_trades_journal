THE Plymouth Comet gives a portrait and biography of Mr. Harry Hems, of Exeter, who, it appears, was born at Islington fifty years ago. His grandfather was one of the judges at the great exhibition of 1851, and the present well-known carver served his apprenticeship at Sheffield. Out of his time in the summer of 1863, he left Sheffield the next day, with just twenty-five shillings in his pocket, and hied to London town. Here, trade being bad, he spent nearly every farthing ere he found anything to do. At last he got a start, piecework, with the result that on the first day he earned exactly eighteen-pence, and broke at least his own kit of new tools. After remaining some time in London, he went to Italy, where he studied in the studios at Florence and Carrara. Here, again, money fell short; so, penniless and without friends, he tramped home alone right across Europe, coming over Mount Cenis, on foot, in mid-winter. It was on the 4th of December, 1866, that Harry Hems was sent from London to Exeter to carve the New Albert Museum, then being erected in that city. It was immediately upon his arrival that he picked up the famous "luckie horseshoe," with which his name has since been so closely identified, and which this day—gilded, and in the place of honour—adorns the exterior of the main facade of his spacious City studios. The "Faithful City" has been his home ever since.
