For particulars apply to W. MURRAY, Esq., 19, Moray Place, Edinburgh.\n\nSUNDERLAND.\n(Only a limited business has been done this week, and prices have come to hang fire. The chief transaction has been amongst which is the sale of about 700 loads of deals, battens, and boards, on account of Messrs. The Sunderland Timber Co., from a cargo of about 2,000 loads which arrived last week from Haparanda, the buyers being Messrs. Joseph Thompson and Co.\nThe remaining portion of the cargo will consist of a very heavy pitch pine specification. Messrs. Kasta, by steamer, from Cronstadt, for Messrs. E. Wiener & Co.\nMessrs. Rayner and Co. have also a steamer from Cronstadt due, and there is also a part cargo by one of their steamers from Stettin to order.\nThe Gothenburg (s), from Gothenburg, with a full cargo usually consigned to Messrs. Short Brothers, order, and the Laleham (s), from Riga, with a part cargo by one of the steamers of the Wilson line.\n\nhave been very light, not comprising any full cargo at Glasgow. There have been a few consignments of parcels of deals per steamer from Montreal; the season for these is now pretty near a finish—three of the Donaldson line steamers have still to arrive (within the next fortnight) and some parcels may also be looked for.\nWe observe the birch logs and ex John Gill are being yarded at Yorkhill for sale (Mr. Geo. Thomson, agent).\nThe Nerano, Baltimore, has discharged at Queen's Dock a large quantity of wood goods, walnut, oak, whitewood, &c., in log and plank, to various consignees; particulars will be found in the import list.\n\nGREENOCK.\nAt Singleton, Dunn, & Co.'s auction sale, on the 9th inst., there was a large representation of the trade. A small business resulted publicly, especially in regard to log timber, the exposers not showing any disposition to press the goods, and a lack of competition being manifest by the members of the trade present. The following are the chief results, viz. :—\ns. d. s. d.\n10 SD sawn yellow pine—\n20 lgs 1 1\n37 20 lgs 9½\n30 SD Quebec oak—\n26 lgs 7½\n30 18 lgs 7\n27 5 lgs 6\n3rd quality bright pine deals—\n12 ft. 9x3 0 9½\n13 ft. 9x3 0 10\n3rd quality bright pine deals—\n7/8 ft 9x3 0 10\n2nd quality bright pine deals—\n10/16 ft 7/17x3 0 10\n3rd quality bright pine ends—\n12 ft 11/19x3 1 2\n\n3rd quality spruce deals—\n12 ft 8x3 0 9¼\n12 ft 9x3 0 10\n12 ft 10x3 0 8\n12 ft 7/11x3 0 9½\n16 ft 4/8ft 1 8½\n3rd quality spruce end—\n4/8ft 7/11x3 1 3\nOffers were made for many of the log samples, but being below the ideas of the exposers were declined.\nThe state of trade continues without any change of importance. Still another steamer with Quebec goods has, however, arrived, viz., the Mereddio, and the discharge is proceeding in the James Watt Dock. There is still an absence of fresh shipbuilding orders, and the lock-out of joiners from the shipyards is still in force.\n\nLEITH.\nThere are considerable arrivals to report this week, the list including the Alma, from Ljusne, with 10,430 deals and battens; the Regnbuen, from Cronstadt, with 12,700 battens, both for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co.; the Ingeborg, from Kotka, with 233,816 board ends, 11,049 bundles boxwood and 4,388 battens, for Messrs. Forslind & Rex; the Moscow (s), from St. Petersburg, with 3,790 rickers, 18,819 deals and battens and 4,314 pieces lathwood; the Majorca (s), from Libau, with 74,987 staves and 110 logs oak; the Golden Love, from Cronstadt, with 12,531 deals and battens, for Messrs. John Mitchell and Co.; the Emblem, from Kotka, with 11,575 deals and battens; the Ketel Motzfeldt, from Helsingfors, with 4,760 deals and battens; and the Curl, from Cronstadt, with 7,705 deals and battens, all for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co.; the Fenris, from Hernosand, with 9,324 deals and battens, and the Louis, from Helsingfors, with 10,933 battens, both for Messrs. Forslind & Rex; the Thorsa (s), from Copenhagen, with 11 logs oak, and the Croma (s), from New York, with 5,974 staves.\nWith so many arrivals things are pretty busy at the docks, but otherwise there is no change to record in the state of trade, which moves along quietly but steadily.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nNov. 11 Magnus Lagaboter—Sundswall-401 lds. fir hewn, 407 lds. fir sawn—J.
