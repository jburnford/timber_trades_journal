SUNDERLAND.
(Only a limited business has been done this week, and prices have come to hang fire. The chief transaction has been amongst which is the sale of about 700 loads of deals, battens, and boards, on account of Messrs. The Sunderland Timber Co., from a cargo of about 2,000 loads which arrived last week from Haparanda, the buyers being Messrs. Joseph Thompson and Co.
The remaining portion of the cargo will consist of a very heavy pitch pine specification. Messrs. Kasta, by steamer, from Cronstadt, for Messrs. E. Wiener & Co.
Messrs. Rayner and Co. have also a steamer from Cronstadt due, and there is also a part cargo by one of their steamers from Stettin to order.
The Gothenburg (s), from Gothenburg, with a full cargo usually consigned to Messrs. Short Brothers, order, and the Laleham (s), from Riga, with a part cargo by one of the steamers of the Wilson line.

have been very light, not comprising any full cargo at Glasgow. There have been a few consignments of parcels of deals per steamer from Montreal; the season for these is now pretty near a finish—three of the Donaldson line steamers have still to arrive (within the next fortnight) and some parcels may also be looked for.
We observe the birch logs and ex John Gill are being yarded at Yorkhill for sale (Mr. Geo. Thomson, agent).
The Nerano, Baltimore, has discharged at Queen's Dock a large quantity of wood goods, walnut, oak, whitewood, &c., in log and plank, to various consignees; particulars will be found in the import list.

GREENOCK.
At Singleton, Dunn, & Co.'s auction sale, on the 9th inst., there was a large representation of the trade. A small business resulted publicly, especially in regard to log timber, the exposers not showing any disposition to press the goods, and a lack of competition being manifest by the members of the trade present. The following are the chief results, viz. :—
s. d. s. d.
10 SD sawn yellow pine—
20 lgs 1 1

Offers were made for many of the log samples, but being below the ideas of the exposers were declined.
The state of trade continues without any change of importance. Still another steamer with Quebec goods has, however, arrived, viz., the Mereddio, and the discharge is proceeding in the James Watt Dock. There is still an absence of fresh shipbuilding orders, and the lock-out of joiners from the shipyards is still in force.

LEITH.
