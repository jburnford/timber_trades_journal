NEW PATENT "HOLLY BUSH" IRON FENCING.
The Blackwall Galvanised Iron Company, Limited, Corbet Court, Gracechurch Street, London, E.C., have just introduced the patent "Holly Bush" iron fencing, which is made of 22 G. sheets, corrugated, and cut along the edges and top to imitate the holly-leaf, with the sharp prickles thrown out on either side, thus making it extremely neat and artistic, and a perfectly unclimbable fencing, and now that the Government have prohibited the use of barbed wire for fencing purposes in thoroughfares this "Holly Bush" fencing should supply a present want. It can be nailed to wooden crossbars in the same way as oak palings or bolted to iron rails, and can easily be fixed by any ordinary workman. It is made in heights from 3 ft. 6 in. to 6 ft., and can be supplied finished either black, galvanised, or painted. This fencing is undoubtedly a distinct improvement, and will, no doubt, be found to answer well. It is strong, durable, and light, and will be found comparatively cheap. It is especially suitable for recreation grounds, railway embankments, plantations, &c., and is likely to find a good market abroad.

THE PARISTAGAN BUILDING SYSTEM.
A MOVEMENT was set on foot a few years ago with the view of finding a substitute for the ordinary freestone used for buildings. The objects aimed at were (1) the erection of dwelling-houses and other buildings, which would approach, if not equal, ordinary stone buildings in comfort and appearance, and (2) the reduction of the cost of building to a price which would bring the ownership of comfortable and attractive dwelling-houses within the reach of a very much wider circle of the people than is possible under the present system. After numerous experiments and tests, a system has been practically perfected which appears to be capable of attaining the objects mentioned. A model building has been erected at No. 65, Bath Street, Glasgow. It has been produced from machinery not specially adapted for the purpose, and while fairly illustrative of the new mode of erection, it does not fully represent the capabilities of the system which would be obtained from a manufactory erected for the purpose. It is claimed that by this system dwelling-houses possessing the appearance and comfort of substantial stone buildings can now be erected, as regards the walls and roof, at a cost about two-thirds less than that of ordinary stone buildings. The system is adapted for villas, cottages, hospitals, chapels, schools, mission halls, railway buildings, club-houses, shooting-boxes, exhibition erections, &c. It includes two forms of building. The one is intended for solid permanent buildings, such as are usually erected on grounds held in feu; and the other form is intended for framework buildings of the kind frequently constructed of corrugated iron, which admits of rapid removal and re-erection on another site without material injury to the fabric. An advantage of the framework system is that dwellings, for example coast houses, may be erected on ground held on lease, and removed if necessary for re-erection on another site at the end of the lease. In both forms Paris-tagan slabs are used for the outer and inner surfaces of the walls. The slabs for the outer surface are made to resemble polished ashlar or freestone. They have, however, a harder and more durable surface than the natural stone. The slabs can be made in ornamental
