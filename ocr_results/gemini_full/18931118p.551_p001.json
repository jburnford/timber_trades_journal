Smith, of Lincoln, has issued a new list containing particulars of his waterproof-composition engine, engine, and estate purposes.\nMr. Smith gives especial attention to the export trade, and his firm, which has been established more than seventy years, has based its trade reputation on the sterling excellence of its manufactures.\nPROPOSED RAILWAY COMPETITION.—At a meeting held at Cardiff Mr. Edwin Seward proposed a new scheme for a railway to compete with the Great Western Company's system.\nThe proposal is to run a line of transit from the Bristol Channel from Cardiff to Watchet, in Somerset, where the harbour would be deepened, and from that point a new line of seven miles would put them in communication with the South-Western Railway's main line, and one only two miles in length would connect them with the Great Western at Weston-super-Mare.\nMANCHESTER SHIP CANAL.—Mr. Marshall Stevens, the manager of the Manchester Ship Canal, has issued the statement which we recently announced as in course of signature by a large number of cotton-spinners, who intend to encourage the use of the canal by giving the preference, when buying to merchants on shipped direct to Manchester, and when buying on the spot, to cotton imported direct and stored in Manchester warehouses.\nThe document has received the signature of firms owning more than 20,000,000 spindles and consuming about 350,000 tons of cotton per annum.\nWELSH GRIMSBY.—The London and North-Western Railway contemplate important alterations at their port at Deganwy on the river Conway, North Wales.\nSome months ago rumours were current that the steam trawling firms sailing to two of the largest companies were removing to Milford Haven their headquarters, but it is now, if possible, to transfer their business to Deganwy.\nA successful experiment has just been concluded.\nA portion of the steam trawler fleet was ordered to rendezvous at Deganwy, and 10 tons of fish were landed there and dispatched to various markets, the facilities for landing being excellent.\nBefore, however, Deganwy can be adopted by the trawling companies, the docks and port will require alteration, as the steam trawlers could not put in there at low water owing to its exposure to storms.\nThe harbour also requires to be lighted, as Deganwy promises to become a first-rate fishing port.\nIt is situated about two miles from Llandudno, and is already very popular.\n\nNOVEMBER 18, 1893.\nIMPORTS.\nBLYTH.\nNov. 10 Bato-Papenburg-170 lds. mining timber-Order\nShiepner-Halmstad-190 lds. mining timber-Order\nPatrician-Gothenburg-246 lds. mining timber-Order\n11 Fama-Fredrikshald-222 lds. mining timber-Order.\nCARDIFF.\nNov. 8 Atlantique-Bayonne-750 lds. fir pitwood-A.
