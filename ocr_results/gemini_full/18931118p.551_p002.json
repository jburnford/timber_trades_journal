Mr J H Scott, general manager of the Timber Trades Association, with Mr G W Thompson, of Goole, accountant, as trustee, and a committee of inspection\nJACOB, G., builder, Elwood Road, Finsbury, and Inderwick Road, Hornsey, was sitting for the bankrupt's public examination was held last week, before Mr. Registrar Hope. The receiving order was made upon the petition of Eastwood & Co., Limited, and accounts were furnished showing total liabilities £6,096 17s. 6d., of which £2,006 5s. 7d. are unsecured. The assets consisting of stock £35, and an estimated surplus of £990 from property held as security, subject to a deduction of £31 5s. 6d. for preferential payments. The bankrupt said that he had carried on speculative building. He commenced in August, 1891, at Surbiton, and left Surbiton in October, 1892, owing about £200. He then went to Hornsey, and built eighteen houses there, under an agreement with Mr. Baylis, who financed him. He ceased building there last August last. The advances then stopped, and he had to stop; the freeholder, Mr. Baylis, entering into possession. It was in July last he first realised that he could not meet his engagements. That was in consequence of his inability to raise further money. The examination was concluded.\nJEREMY RICHARD, timber merchant, New Inn Broadway, Curtain Road. The bankrupt filed his petition on September 18, and a sitting for his public examination was held on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Hope. The accounts showed liabilities £952 11s. 8d, of which £635 3s are unsecured, and assets £342 1s. 2d. The bankrupt, in the course of his examination by Mr. H. Brougham, Official Receiver, said his business had been affected by changes in the neighbourhood consequent upon improvements by the County Council. His failure was mainly due to the fact that he was largely indebted to Messrs. Goodman and Hughes, to whom he was indebted. He had purchased timber from that firm to the amount in all of about £700, upon special terms as to credit, but when they failed he was required to make payments forthwith, and he had not sufficient capital at his disposal to enable him to meet the demands. He did not realise that he was insolvent at the beginning of this year, although he was sometime previously made out a balance-sheet which showed assets of only 10s. or 15s. in the pound. He had made out that account from information of some of his principal creditors, and at their suggestion he went on trading, in the hope that he would pull through and be able to pay 20s. in the pound. He made all payments by bills or cheques, and did not always, with the aid of his pass book, ascertain how he stood. He had been doing a good and increasing business, and was doing a good trade under larger premises, but the rent induced him to sell. In reply to the Registrar, the bankrupt said he had considered that he was solvent until February or March of this year. He added, in reply to his solicitor, Mr. Gardner, that, notwithstanding the forced sale of his stock, his assets still showed 15s. in the pound. The examination was concluded.\nKNUDSEN BROTHERS AND COMPANY, timber merchants and general agents, 70, Wormwood-street, E.C. The firm consisted of two partners, Knud Christian Knudsen and Sigurd Knudsen, and the business was that of timber merchants and general agents, established in January last.",
