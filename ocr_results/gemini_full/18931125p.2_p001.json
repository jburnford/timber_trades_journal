Also all kinds of HARDWOODS for Shipment per Rail.\nTelegraphic Address—\"TIMBER, INVERNESS.\"\n\nWe are informed that Messrs. John Fleming & Co., timber merchants, Aberdeen, have signed a trust deed, indicating that the assets will be realised gradually.\n\nAt Grangemouth there has been quite a small fleet of timber vessels discharging.\nThere is, however, an abundance of storage, and a fair proportion transhipping direct, so that stocks are not becoming excessive.\n\nTRADE REPORTS.\nDUNDEE.\nThe importing season as far as Baltic goods are concerned is now practically over; a steamer's deckload of deals from Riga is discharging at present, but stocks may now be fairly looked upon as completed, and they consist chiefly of moderate dimensions in most sizes, with a tendency to shortness in one or two ordinary scantlings of whitewood.\nPrices are still getting a moderate advance, and deliveries proceed on much the same average as for the past few weeks, while prices remain without change.\nOwing to the severe storm in end of last week, and the consequent immense fall of timber in this and surrounding districts, the home wood trade may be expected to suffer a downward tendency in prices, not only of the cheaper firs, but also of the more valuable hardwoods, which have been blown down in such quantities as may affect the market materially for some time.\n\nGLASGOW.\nA fairly active state of trade continues here, our principal wood-consuming industries being pretty well employed. In shipbuilding the work in hand and under contract is estimated at 181,000 tons, compared with 166,000 tons at corresponding period last year. The lock-out of the Clyde ship-joiners is in the meantime retarding operations in this department, but it is hoped that efforts which are now being made to adjust matters and bring the dispute to an end will result successfully.\nThere is a small list of arrivals to week, no full cargo being among timber imports, but some considerable parcels of Quebec deals have just come in per Siberian (s) and Tritonia (s). The former has consignments to Singleton, Dunn, & Co. and Edmiston & Mitchells, amounting to about 15,000 pieces, and consisting of 1st quality and 4th quality pine chiefly. The Tritonia's (s) comprise 11,000 pieces 1st and 3rd quality pine deals, for F. A. Lightbody, & Co.; 3,000 deals for Singleton, Dunn, & Co. and the rest are spruce deals for same.\nIn connection with the failure of Hunter & Co. a meeting of creditors was held a few days ago, and the statement of affairs submitted showed about 7s. per pound. An offer of 6s. 8d., we understand, has been made.\n\nThe sale held on Wednesday last by Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells, particulars of which are given below, was fairly well attended. There was an attractive variety which embraced numerous deals, shipments of Quebec pine and spruce deals, also Quebec and Lower Port birch logs, States walnut, oak and whitewood, &c. Prices for pine deals are fully maintained. A good many lots were withdrawn, the offers made not coming up to exposers' ideas.\nAuction sale, on 22nd inst., by Messrs.

Deliveries, particularly from the ponds, are very moderate, and the demand is slackening off with the approach of the end of the year. The saw-mills are well employed so far, but fresh orders are scarce. There has not been any arrival of timber this week, and there is now only one Quebec cargo to arrive per sailer Reciprocity. The vessel had to put into Halifax in distress, but is still expected to complete the voyage. A steady feeling maintains itself in the market, and there is no anxiety as to prices, but the reverse, due chiefly to the small stocks of most kinds of timber combined with the regular consumption going on. House and shipbuilding are, on the whole, quiet in this locality, and there is need of greater activity in some of the building yards. The contracts have just been placed for a building of considerable extent, to be used as a model lodging-house, the joinery work going to Mr. Thomas Jamieson, Greenock.\nAllison, Cousland, & Co. held an auction sale at Princes Pier on the 23rd inst., the particulars of which we shall publish next week.\n\nLEITH.\nThere are several important arrivals this week, including the Edinburgh (s), from Quebec, with 340 logs birch, 292 logs waney board pine, and 10,181 deals, for Messrs. John Mitchell & Co. ; the Moravia (s), from Riga, with 5,903 deals and battens, and the Gerda, from Abo, with 15,060 deals and battens, for Messrs. Garland & Roger; the Kordula, from Helsingfors, with 12,502 deals and battens; the John Franklin, from Pernoviken, with 21,867 battens, and the Atlas, from Helsingfors, with 10,746 deals and battens, all for Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. There are very few cargoes now expected, the importation being nearly completed for the season.\nMr. D. W. Beattie held a public sale of deals and battens, on Tuesday, 21st inst., at the Edinburgh Dock. There was not a large",
