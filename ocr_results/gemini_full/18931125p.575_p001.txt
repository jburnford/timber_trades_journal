NOVEMBER 25, 1893.
Gentlemen, as you are aware not very long ago the mahogany auction sales were held in the open air, and very often owing to the inclemency of the weather, buyers suffered much inconvenience and discomfort. Mr. Dobell announced since we inaugurated a better state of affairs, we are now enabled to buy our mahogany in a state of comfort. A few of the members of the trade, being desirous of marking this event, have subscribed and purchased this auctioneer's hammer, and I have great pleasure in presenting it to Mr. Dobell, sincerely hoping that he may be spared for many years to grace the rostrum with his genial presence.
Mr. Frank Tiffany (Messrs Illingworth, Ingham, & Co., Leeds), said: I will not take up much of your time, but on behalf of the country buyers I rise to support the remarks made by Mr. Murphy in presenting this testimonial to Mr. Dobell, and I have the greatest pleasure in doing so. Only yesterday, when looking my catalogue, the thought came across my mind that it was marvellous the trade should have for such a long period endured the barbarous system which formerly prevailed, and had to spend hours in marking their catalogues in the yards in all weathers to secure a few lots. Thanks to you, sir, a better system now prevails, and I hope you have before you a long career in which to wield the hammer with success to yourself and partner, and to the satisfaction of the trade. There ought, I think, to be very keen competition for the first lot you knock down.
Mr. Dobell replied: This handsome present, in combination with the kindly words which have just fallen from the lips of my friends, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Tiffany, and which have been so heartily received by you, have caused me so much embarrassment, and I feel for once that language fails me to express my feelings. I can only say I thank you, and that you may rely, and assure you that there are few things, if any, that I shall prize more than this. So long as I am able to wield this hammer I hope our sales will be conducted with the same impartiality and fairness that we have pursued in the past. I think I may say the custom of holding sales inside a room is now fairly established, but I wish to go a little further and have one public saleroom, where all brokers could have their sales and, if possible, all on the same day.
With a round of applause this part of the day's proceedings terminated, and the company then, given on another page, proceeded to the usual sale.
JOHN AND LIVERPOOL.—In former days, says the Daily Telegraph of St. John, N.B., it was the fashion to describe this port as the Liverpool of British North America. We have lost the name now, although it is sometimes described, with a sneer, by persons who wish to twit our people with what they are pleased to be their inferior position. Nevertheless, in spite of all sneers and flouts, St. John is still the Liverpool of British North America, and that to a greater extent than it ever was before. Its natural advantages are not inferior to those of Liverpool, and it is a much greater city now than Liverpool was a couple of centuries ago. Even as late as the year 1700 Liverpool had only 41,000 inhabitants, and in 1751 the tonnage of ships entering that port was only 150,000, or less than the tonnage now entering St. John every year. Why, then, should our people permit themselves to be sneered out of a proper pride in their own city? It is not merely because St. John, one of the chief ports of a country with 5,000,000 people, is not so important commercially as one of the great ports of a country with 40,000,000 people, that city not being the greatest commercial nation in the world? The truth of the matter is that St. John, considering its age and its opportunities, is a wonderful city, especially in view of the great disasters through which it has passed. Of its natural advantages we are more proud than that of any port on the Atlantic coast of Canada, because, besides possessing an excellent harbour, it is at the mouth of a great river which must always be the source of a large business for its people. The approach to the pool by way of the Channel is not safe, but the approach to St. John by way of the Bay of Fundy. The tides of Liverpool are of great strength, but the entrance into Liverpool is far more difficult than the entrance to St. John. St. John has a 21 ft channel at low water spring tides, and at no time at half flood this channel should be less than 30 ft in depth.
