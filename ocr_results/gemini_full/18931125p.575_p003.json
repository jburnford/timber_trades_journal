Mr. A. H. Mackintosh, Senior Official Receiver, said valuable information was wanted as to deeds of property. The bankrupt was unable to be there when present, and he would ask for a further adjournment. No opposition was raised and this was granted.\nCHAPPELL, JOHN T.—This was a sitting for public examination, on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The bankrupt was a builder and contractor carrying on business at Pimlico, Chelsea, Battersea, and elsewhere. He has been engaged in very extensive operations, and his accounts disclose gross liabilities £242,892, of which £55,435 are stated to be unsecured, and £176,690 to be fully secured, the assets being estimated at £42,190, subject to the realisation of property held as security. The Assistant Receiver (Mr. Grey) said it was necessary that the bankrupt should be examined upon his accounts before his public examination was proceeded with, and he therefore asked for an adjournment. Adjourned to December 7th.\nCRAVEN, THOMAS, builder and timber merchant of Billington, and carrying on business at Bold Street Saw-mills, Blackburn.—At the Blackburn County Court, on Monday, before Judge Coventry, the Official Receiver's report was read upon the application in bankruptcy for the discharge of the debtor. Mr. Higginson represented the bankrupt, and Mr. Carter the trustees. The bankrupt commenced business in 1862 with £45 capital, and in 1892 a receiving order was made upon his own petition. The accounts disclosed a deficiency of £8,282 19s. 2d., of which £5,035, it was said, was due to depreciation in the value of mortgaged property. The Official Receiver reported that the assets were not equal to 10s. in the pound, and that the bankrupt had omitted to keep proper books of accounts. The Official Receiver said the bankrupt had not been idle, or unsteady, or self-indulgent, but had only shown want of care in conducting his business. Mr. Higginson, referring to the sum put down for depreciation in property value, reminded his Honour that in 1891 there were the great Whalley frauds, and immediately afterwards property became a drug in the market, and its value was very severely depreciated, houses having to be sold for considerably less than their cost. Mr. Craven's had been an honest failure, and as he had been two years without his discharge Mr. Higginson urged that for his Honour's consideration. Mr. Carter put in the resolution of the committee of inspection, which stated that the failure had arisen principally from losses sustained in the contract for the erection of the Technical School, and they recommended that his discharge be granted. His Honour, in giving judgment, said he believed that if the bankrupt had taken stock and kept proper books of profit and loss he would have found he was insolvent. There was nothing dishonest or detrimental to debtor's character as an honest man, but he had offended against the Bankruptcy Act by trading on the money of creditors when he ought to have known he was insolvent, and his discharge would be suspended for two and a half years.\nDOOWELL, CHRISTOPHER JOHN, cabinet-maker, 33, Mount Ephraim, and 8, Camden Road, Tunbridge Wells.—The statutory meeting of the creditors took place on Tuesday, at the offices of the Official Receiver for the Tunbridge Wells district, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S E., under the presidency of Mr. Mackintosh. The Chairman said the debtor had submitted an offer of composition of 20s. in the pound, and 4 per cent. interest on all debts provable in bankruptcy as follows:—A sum of 10s. in the pound within three months after the approval of the scheme by the Court, and a further sum of 10s. within six months of the said approval, these payments to be guaranteed to the satisfaction of the Official Receiver. The Chairman remarked that he had heard nothing further about the composition being guaranteed, and unless there was some kind of a guarantee the Court would not sanction the scheme. The debtor, in reply to the Official Receiver, said he had not been able to get the composition guaranteed, but no doubt his wife would do so; however, he had nothing in writing to show that she would be come surety. The Chairman then went through the proofs, and found that there were not enough creditors in favour of the composition to carry it through; therefore the debtor must be adjudicated bankrupt. The question then arose as to the appointment of a trustee. The Baltic Saw-mills, who were creditors for £18, had sent in a proof, and a proposal that Mr. Spencer, of Spencer & Hother, estate agents, Tunbridge Wells, should be trustee, but two other creditors were in favour of Mr. Webb, of London. The following gentlemen were then appointed as a committee of inspection:—Mr. C. B. Powell, Baltic Saw-mills; Mr. A. V. Humphries, Warwick Lane, E.C.; Henry Ward, of Messrs. Potts & Ward, Great Eastern Street, E.C. Resolutions were then passed approving of the appointment of Mr. Spencer as special manager, that the remuneration of the trustee be left in the hands of the committee of inspection, and that the premium on the trustee's bond be paid out of the estate.\nFAULKNER, A. E., builder and contractor, 9, Apple Tree Yard, St. James.—The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Monday before Mr. H. Brougham. The debtor commenced the business, which was left to him by his uncle, in July, 1890, the liabilities being taken over by his cousin. He had for about nineteen years prior to July, 1890, been in the employ of his uncle, latterly at a salary of £150 per annum. The statutory accounts were not filed, but the liabilities were estimated at about £1,600, the failure being attributed to loss on a contract, want of capital, heavy expense of the business premises, liability of a bill for the accommodation of J. Foss, and to\n\nlaw costs. The debtor made no proposal, and it was resolved that his affairs should be wound up in bankruptcy. Mr. R. J. Ward was appointed trustee of the estate, and a committee of inspection was also nominated, consisting of Mr. W. E. Wright, Mr. A. T. Richardson, Matthew T. Shaw & Co.), and Mr. J. H. White. The public examination is fixed for December 7th at 12 o'clock.\nFISK, SAMUEL HENRY, contractor, East Greenwich.—Unsecured liabilities amount to £910 1s. 11d. The assets are returned at £97, thus leaving a deficiency of £815 1s. 11d. The receiving order was made on the 17th ult., on the petition of the creditor, an order of adjudication has since been made. The bankrupt states that he commenced business in 1884 with £100 capital, in his own name, and that he continued that business until July 31st last. The bankrupt also states that on that date a meeting of his creditors was held, and subsequently he executed a deed of assignment, a Mr. Woolf being the trustee. The bankrupt alleges his failure has been caused through loss through death of horses, bad debts, and law expenses. The bankrupt further states that all his assets have been handed over to Mr. Woolf, the trustee, under the deed of assignment. I have not yet been able to obtain from Mr. Woolf any accounts and particulars. Mr. Woolf also has the books.\nHAM, GEORGE, builder and contractor, Church Court, and Holland Street, Kensington. —The debtor filed his petition on Oct. 30, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Monday before Mr. H. Brougham. The debtor commenced business in 1872, with small capital, at 10, Church Court, Kensington, where, and also since 1890 at 33, Holland Street, he has traded down to the date of the receiving order. He attributes his failure to want of capital, to loss on contracts, and immediately to loss of credit through a prosecution against him for cruelty to a horse, and to law costs in connection with the same. The liabilities are stated in the accounts at £1,017 17s. 11d., of which £796 16s. 3d. are unsecured, and the assets are estimated to realise £284 8s. 2d., after providing for preferential payments.

The summary of accounts filed by the debtor disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £584 8s. 11d., of which £350 was due to fully secured creditors, and £229 to unsecured creditors. The assets were estimated to produce £212, less £6 for the payment of preferential creditors payable in full. The report and observations of the Official Receiver were to the effect that the bankruptcy appears to have been caused through a series of accidents coming on a small business. The debtor has lodged a proposal to pay a composition of 10s. in the pound by two equal instalments, the first within a month of the date of confirmation of the scheme by the Court,",
