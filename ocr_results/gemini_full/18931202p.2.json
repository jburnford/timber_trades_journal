Edmiston & Mitchells, and one of deals, &c. at Yorkhill Wharf, Glasgow, on Wednesday, 13th December, by Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co.\n\nThe shipbuilding report for the past month states that ten steamers and six sailing vessels, aggregating 20,600 tons, were launched, as compared with 13 vessels, with a total of 18,646 last November. The production for the eleven months of the year amounts to 264,462 tons, or 44,149 tons below the total for the corresponding period of 1892. The lock-out of Clyde joiners unfortunately continues, the matters in dispute not being yet arranged. A good deal of anxiety is caused by the miners' strike, which, unless settled, will occasion the stoppage of a number of works on the Clyde for want of fuel.\n\nThe arrivals of wood goods during the week have been moderate, as will be seen from the list on another page; in addition to what are there noted, we have to mention the following, which have since come in: about 30,000 pieces deals and ends, per Amarynthia (s), from Montreal, for Allison, Cousland, & Co.; 10,000 deals, per Pome-ranian, from Montreal, for Singleton, Dunn, & Co.; and 550 St. Pet. stds. spruce deals, per Parthena, from St. John, N.B., for Robt. Sheriff. The regular liners, Warwick (s) and Hestia (s), which are expected within the next few days, will be the last arrivals from Montreal for the season. At Greenock there have been no arrivals to note for the week.\n\nPrices of timber (Quebec, &c.) are firm, importers feeling their position strengthened from the restricted imports of the past season and generally moderate stocks now held.\n\nGREENOCK.\nThe course of business in this market is unchanged, and without any incident of importance. Imported goods generally are going into consumption at a moderate but steady rate, and with the end of the year so near the volume of business is fairly satisfactory.\nThere have been no fresh arrivals since our last issue.\n\nThe unfortunate strike which has now set in in the Scotch coal trade, if it lasts many days longer, will most seriously affect local industries. Already two of the shipyards intimate the closing of their works at the end of this week on account of the scarcity of fuel.\n\nA large representation of the trade attended Allison, Cousland & Co.'s auction sale at Prince's Pier, but as wide divergencies existed between the values, as estimated by the exposers and those present, comparatively little business resulted publicly, but we understand quite a number of the lots were afterwards cleared privately.\n\nThe following are the chief public sales:—\nPer Page.

Park, Dobson & Co.; 7,889 deals and battens per Nanna, from Porsgrund, for Messrs. John Mitchell & Co., 18,604 deals and battens per A. N. Singleton, from Cronstadt, for Messrs. Garland & Roger; 78,900 staves per Perwie (s), from Memel, and 50,479 staves per Morena (s), from Libau.\n\nThe importation to date, although behind that of last year, has been a fair average one, and unless there is a larger consumption than anticipated stocks should be ample for all requirements.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nNov. 23 Linno Dee-Hamburg\nElizabeth-Riga-250 lds. fir logs, 30 lds. fir battens, 30 lds. fir spars, 80 lds. firewood-G.
