J. Hunt held a sale, at the Falcon Hotel, High Wycombe.\nThere was a large company present, and the bidding was brisk.\nMessrs. Glenister, Parker, Mealing, Cheese, Baker, & Ball were the principal buyers.\nBeech, ash, and cherry were the woods offered, and they realised from 10d. to 1s. per cubic feet.\n\nM & CO.,\nI WORKS,\nLONDON, S.W.\n\nFor reducing as far as possible the cost of saw sharpening, which forms so considerable an item in Saw-mill expenditure.\nThe file is dispensed with, a disc of consolidated emery or corundum being substituted.\nThe disc can be set at angles to suit form of teeth required, and for gulletting, topping, bevelling, &c.\nFor mill saws a vice with a compound table is affixed to the Machine, and for circulars one as shown in the engraving.\n\nInvaluable for shaping out moulding cutters.\n\nSAW SHARPENING MACHINE.\nMill Saw Vice extra, £3\nPatent, for Cash.\nTelegrams: \"[?]\"\nApplication.\n\nDECEMBER 2, 1893.\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nTAYLOR BROS., MILL WEB SAWS,\nADELAIDE WORKS, SHEFFIELD.\nIMPORTS.\nBARNSTAPLE.\nNov. 21 Genius—Carlsvik—147 lds. fir deals, 147 lds. fir battens, 9 lds. fir boards—Lewin\nNov. 27 Skuld—Gefle—261 lds. fir deals and flooring boards, 227 lds. fir battens—Robert Trading Co.\nBOSTON.\nNov. 22 Florida—Riga—265 lds. fir battens, 108 lds. fir boards—Stevenson, Dowsing & Co.\nAnger—Christiania—165 lds. fir battens, 227 lds. fir boards—Boston Timber Trading Co.\nNov. 27 Jason—Gefle—1,475 lds. fir deals, 1,391 planed boards, 1,400 lds. fir battens and ends—Taylors & Co.\nAVONMOUTH DOCK.\nNov. 25 Dominion (s)—Montreal—240 cs. match splints—O.
