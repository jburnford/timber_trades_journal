HOME-GROWN TIMBER.

THE CROWN TIMBER SALES.
Some dissatisfaction appears to exist amongst buyers at certain of the Crown sales of timber, more particularly those held in the New Forest, and it goes without saying that for sales to be successful there should be no doubt about anything but *bonâ-fide* competition at the auctions; but from correspondence which we have received, it appears that, whether with or without the knowledge and consent of the officials responsible for the sales, the idea prevails amongst some buyers that the auctioneer often exceeds his authority by bidding against the buyers.
According to the conditions of sale, the Crown reserved to itself the right to bid once by its officer or officers who may be present at the sale; but, if we are correctly informed, the following instance tends to show that they are not confined to this.
At the last sale held in the Queen's House, Lyndhurst, a certain lot was run up to £21, and when it was knocked down the auctioneer said it was bought in.
Subsequently on going through the catalogue the second time the same lot was put up and eventually sold at £16, or £5 less.
there is some explanation of this, the inference, of course, is that the first sale was not a genuine one, and in the interest both of the sellers and buyers, it is important that such practices should be discontinued, so that the *bonâ-fide* nature of the competition—which is the essence of all unreserved sales—should be thoroughly maintained.

BUCKINGHAMSHIRE.—On Monday, Mr. C. J. Hunt held a sale, at the Falcon Hotel, High Wycombe.
There was a large company present, and the bidding was brisk.
Messrs. Glenister, Parker, Mealing, Cheese, Baker, & Ball were the principal buyers.
Beech, ash, and cherry were the woods offered, and they realised from 10d. to 1s. per cubic feet.
