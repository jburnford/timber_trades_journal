FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BURTON, ARTHUR ALFRED, trading as Burton and Co., earthenware makers, Hanley.-A meeting of the creditors in this bankruptcy was held on Tuesday at the offices of Mr. T. Bullock, Official Receiver, Newcastle-under-Lyme, on Tuesday. The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £396 8s. 2d., ranking for dividend £289 10s. 9d., against assets estimated to produce £136 16s. 10d. The debtor attributed his failure to adjudicated bankrupts. He stated that he commenced business in 1889, with a borrowed capital of £100, admitting that at that time he were insolvent in joining his brother, who had been trading in the hope that things would come round. Mr. G. G. P. Adderley, of Longton, was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection.
KETTERINGHAM, GEORGE, carpenter and builder, Beccles.-The liabilities are returned at £163 14s., debtor's assets being nil. Debtor began business in 1889, with £100, on premises where he had previously been employed as a journeyman, after having been in business for himself for only book he kept was a small memorandum book, and he was due from customers about £20, but he had not got a living. In 1889 he gave a bill of sale to the Norwich and Norfolk Loan Company for £30, for which he was paying 1s. per week interest. He had a share and had been a director of the company, and he had borrowed of his brother.
MILLS, WILLIAM, builder and merchant, Bath.-The Official Receiver has issued particulars under this failure. From these it appears that the unsecured liabilities are returned at £808, to fully secured creditors £1,000. The assets consist of the stock-in-trade, book debts, &c., leaving a surplus of £100, which is returned as an asset. The gross liabilities are £1,808. The Official Receiver states that the debtor has carried on business for about twenty years, and has had a capital of £1,000, and until recently has been successful.
