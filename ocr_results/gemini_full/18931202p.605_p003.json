Bullock, Official Receiver, Newcastle-under-Lyme, on Tuesday. The debtors’ statement showed gross liabilities £400 8s. 4d., of which £396 6s. 2d. ranks for dividend. The assets are estimated at £260 10s. 4d., leaving a deficiency of £136 16s. 10d. The debtors have been adjudged bankrupts. The debtors had commenced business in September, 1892, with a capital of £100, admitted that they knew they were insolvent in June last, but continued trading in the hope of pulling the business round. Mr. G. G. Poppleton, accountant, Birmingham, was appointed trustee.\n\nKETTERINGHAM, ARTHUR, carpenter and builder, Ber Street, Norwich. Liabilities, £163 14s., deficiency, £90.—The Debtor began business in 1888 with £50, on premises where he had been employed as a journeyman, after his master retired. The only book he kept was one showing what was due from customers. During the first year he got a living. In 1889 he did some work for the Norwich and Norfolk Investment Corporation, for which he was paid in 31 shares of £5 each, 6s. per share had been paid. Since the stoppage of the company 15s. per share had been claimed of him by writ issued by the liquidator, and in consequence of that he filed his petition. The examination was closed, with the exception of one question which was withdrawn last week.\n\nMILLS, WILLIAM P., timber merchant, Bath.—The Official Receiver has issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the unsecured debts amount to £604, to fully secured creditors £510, the value of the securities being estimated at £590, thus leaving a surplus of £80, which is claimed to rank as an asset. The report and observations of the Official Receiver state that with a view to that effect. The debtor in November, 1892, commenced business as a timber merchant with a capital of £200, and he continued it for about a fortnight ago, when he relinquished it as it did not pay. He has been gradually reducing his stock, and has not any plant and utensils. Within the past few months he has endeavoured to float a limited company for the purpose of constructing a bridge across the Avon near Bath, but as the capital subscribed was insufficient the matter had to be abandoned. He had paid, or been responsible for, debts amounting to £175 in connection with speculation. The only tangible asset appears to be the equity of redemption in a house at Station Road, Bath, upon which there are two mortgages for £400 and £150. The first meeting of creditors was held at the offices of the Official Receiver on the 23rd ult., when the debtor was questioned by Mr. Gibbs, who appeared for creditors, as to how he lost the £175 over the bridge scheme. The debtor said he had not kept any account, but £75 went for printing, and £5 for legal expenses. He had also made at least fifty journeys to Bristol. A creditor said he should try to institute a criminal prosecution, as the debtor had within three weeks of the date of the receiving order incurred a debt by means of false pretences, he having written a letter saying £2,400 worth of shares had been subscribed for. The debtor denied having made any such statement, but the creditor said he had it in black and white, and if it brought debtor within the law, he should prosecute. The Official Receiver suggested that the matter had better be left over until the public examination. Mr. Gibbs said he would leave his questions until then. Mr. Stewart said he was going to submit a offer of 5s. in the pound, secured by the debtor’s father, but in view of the threats just made he did not know whether to bring it forward. Mr. Gibbs: Will it be cash down? Mr. Stewart: Yes.—After further discussion the offer was increased to 7s. 6d. in the pound, conditionally, upon two claims for £371 and £65 respectively. The meeting was then adjourned, in order that the Official Receiver might submit the scheme to the creditors, and report on same.\n\nPYE, WILLIAM, timber merchant, Preston.—The public examination of the above debtor came on for hearing on Friday week at the Preston Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Hulton. The debtor’s summary of accounts disclosed liabilities amounting to £5,633, and the assets were returned at £1,361, thus leaving a deficiency of £4,271. The debtor said he commenced business without capital about sixteen years ago, as a timber merchant in Lancaster Road, Preston. He borrowed about £70 to start with, and after he had been in business he compounded with his creditors, paying them a composition of 10s. in the pound. His liabilities then amounted to £700. He subsequently paid his creditors in full, with the exception of one or two, who did not press him to pay them. He went from Lancaster Road to Sizer Street, where he added cabinet and chair making. He was in partnership with his brother for some time, and when the latter retired witness agreed to pay him £1,000, but he had only been able to pay £750, and his brother was now a creditor for the balance. In April, 1892, he executed a deed of assignment for the benefit of his creditors, in respect of another business which he carried on under the style of Pye & Co. He started that business for the benefit of his brother Richard, and he never took any profits from it or benefitted by it in any way. That business lost on an average £130 per annum, and the total loss was about £1,500. The stock sold for about £600 less than it cost. No proper balance sheets have ever been made out, but a rough stocktaking and a list of debts were made out to show how things were going. There was never a full disclosure of the state of the business, as there was considerable friction between him and his brother. He could not say what his brother took out of the business. His wife carried on business as a box-maker. He had nothing to do with that business, and since his bankruptcy his wife had given him 50s. per week for assisting her in carrying on the business. His father-in-law, Mr. Margerison, was the principal customer for the boxes. The money for that business was found principally by his brother Septimus. He had put about £500 into it. He had no interest in the business, but drew five per cent. for his money. Under the assignment the creditors were paid 10s. in the pound, the balance of which is included in the debts to the amount of £2,947.—The Registrar: What, in addition to the other liabilities?—The Official Receiver: Yes, is it not perfectly horrifying?—The Debtor, in replying to further questions put by the Official Receiver, said he could hardly account for this state of affairs.—The Registrar said he thought the matter ought to be thoroughly investigated by the trustee. If that the Official Receiver should be the trustee he was now investigating the matter. The examination was then ordered to be adjourned.\n\nRIPPER, H. T. & E. J.

This firm has consulted Mr. Harry Cousins, of Cardiff, with reference to their affairs and a claim of £10,000 made against them by the liquidator of the National Bank of Wales, Limited. He has issued the following letter:—After having considered the matter and taken the advice of Mr. W. Ililey, of Messrs. Alexander and Co., Cardiff, I have thought it right that a statement of affairs should be prepared and submitted to you at a meeting of creditors at the Royal Hotel, Cardiff, on the 6th inst., when the creditors will be able to consider what course shall be adopted. The statement is being prepared by Messrs. Harris, Gibson, Barrett, West, and Thornley, of London and Birmingham, gentlemen who have a peculiar knowledge of the timber trade. I shall be obliged if you can send to Mr. West of that firm at Messrs. Roberts and Co’s business address on receipt of this letter, correct particulars of your account, together with a statement of all bills and notes, when due, and what amounts have been issued, but I venture most strongly to urge that no further proceedings be taken against Messrs. Roberts in the meantime, or at any rate until the meeting has taken place, as I am sure you will feel that this suggestion is made in the best interests of all parties concerned.—At the creditors meeting at the Royal Hotel, Cardiff, on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Gelli-brand (Foy, Morgan, & Co.) in the chair, representing £15,000 were present. A statement of account showed gross liabilities £18,526 17s. 6d.; assets, stock, working plant, &c., £4,335 3s. 8d.; book debts and cash in hand, £1,043 1s. 6d. Balance due on contract, £80; other property, £50; less preferential claims, £243 13s. Total, £5,265 12s. 2d.; deficiency, £13,261 5s. 4d. An offer of 6s. in the pound was made, but not being accepted, an offer of 7s. 6d. was made, 5s. in cash, and 2s. 6d. in three months approved bills, which the creditors agreed to accept, subject to the bank falling in with the arrangement and surrendering all securities held by them. In the meantime Mr. Harris, head clerk of the debtors under the control of Messrs. W. Riley, J. M. Jennings, and C. E. Dovey, was appointed to carry on the business.\n\nSMITHER, SAMUEL, timber merchant, Leonard Street, and Ravey Street, Shoreditch, E., and Albion Road, Dalston, N.E.—The debtor filed his petition on November 1st, and the first meeting of his creditors was held on Monday before Mr. A. H. Wildy, Official Receiver, when the gross statement of affairs showed liabilities £2,349 7s. 1d., of which a further £[?] was secured in a [?].",
