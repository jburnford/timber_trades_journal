RAILWAY RATES FOR TIMBER.
On Monday week a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Timber Trade Federation and of members who have grievances in connection with the working of the Clearing House arrangement of March last was held at the London Chamber of Commerce. Mr. W. V. K. Stenning, and subsequently Mr. W. Adams, presided. It was reported that a large number of letters had been received from members in various parts of the country, and a precis of the principal points which it was proposed to lay before the railway managers on the following day was submitted to the meeting. This was exhaustively discussed, and speakers were selected to deal with the points on which they were specially conversant. The conference took place on Tuesday at the Railway Clearing House, the Federation being represented by the following gentlemen:—
Messrs. S. B. Boulton, W. V. K. Stenning, W. S. Ogden, W. Adams, W. W. Ridley, W. B. Partridge, C. Hopton, London; J. P. Fea, S. Margerison, James Taylor, G. Miles, John Hall (for William Ivens), Alfred English, James Harrison, E. Lowe, J. F. Ebner, Green (Mott & Dickson), and C. E. Musgrave, Assistant Secretary to the Federation.
The railway companies were numerously represented, and the Conference was presided over by Mr. Shaw, of the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, those present including Messrs. Partington, L. & N.W.; Twelvetrees, G.N.R.; Jesper, N.E.R, and Light, S.E.R. The proceedings lasted upwards of three hours, the main object being "the ascertainment of the points in difference" between them, the managers, and the timber trade. The representations made were courteously received by the managers, who promised that they should be carefully considered and definitely settled at a future conference between a small sub-committee of the Federation and the managers respectively.
The following is an epitome of the points discussed:—
1. Questions raised in the Federations' letter to Mr. Birt, dated July 3rd, 1893, as to the working arrangements of March 17th and 28th, 1893, and the co-operation of the railway companies in securing the passing of the Railway Rates and Charges (Timber) Amendment Bill in such a form as might be mutually agreed upon.
2. Suggestions as to scribing or marking of foreign imported timber, to give effect to recommendations made by the Federation at the conference on March 28th.
3. Specific objections to arrangements by the railway companies for the checking of measurement by their inspectors of English timber.
4. The Railway Clearing House classification of June last, and certain divergences therein from the arrangements of March 17th and 18th last.
5. The advance of 5 per cent. on last year's rates and question in connection therewith.
6. Measurement by "tape over bark" of English round timber.
7. Wharfage charges. How far does the general arrangement to revert to last year's rates for British round timber cover wharfage charges?
8. Classification of timber.
9. Conditions as to rates on planed flooring boards or other flooring or prepared boards.
10. Questions as to the classification of flooring boards and paving blocks.
11. The all-round charge of 1s. per ton for loading English timber and questions in connection therewith.
12. Tonnage weight for converted timber not clearly defined.
13. Rates charged by southern companies.
It is confidently believed that the proceedings of the conference will eventuate in a satisfactory settlement of the questions raised, and more particularly in regard to increased rates, against which a strong protest was made by the Federation.

THE CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERS' SOCIETY recently visited the improvement works of the London and India Docks Joint Committee at Blackwall, now in course of construction from the designs of Mr. H. F. Donaldson, M.I.C.E. On the completion of these alterations, vessels drawing 29ft. will be able to enter the docks. The works consist of enlargements of the old lock entrance from the Thames, and of the two cuts that give communication between the Blackwall Basin and the import and export docks. These cuts will be increased in width from 45 ft. to 60 ft., and increased in depth from 25 ft. to 30 ft.
QUEBEC.—The returns of the quantity of timber measured and culled by the supervisor of culler's office at Quebec to the beginning of November this year show a falling-off in almost every kind of timber. For instance, there were only 2,460,441 feet of waney white pine, as compared with 2,659,166 feet in 1892; 1,120,697 feet of white pine, as compared with 2,310,081 feet in 1892; 303,391 feet of red pine, against 392,196 feet in the previous year; 573,079 feet of elm, against 198,806 feet; 158,285 feet of ash, against 198,806 feet, and 140,999 feet of birch and maple against 425,927 feet. In the item of oak alone was there an increase, the figures being 1,150,087 feet for the present year, against 915,913 feet last year.
A DERELICT.—One of the most interesting derelicts I have seen reported, says a writer in the Trans-port, was that of the schooner Twenty-one Friends. She was abandoned in March, about 175 miles east of Cape Henry. Her timber laden, she continued to float. Her masts were carried away close to the deck, so that there was but little surface exposed to the wind, and her progress was almost entirely due to the current of the Gulf Stream. Her track across the Atlantic was directly in the route of European steamers, by whom she was sighted many times. She was finally towed into port near the Bay of Biscay. During her long cruise she covered some 3,300 miles, which made an average of about 425 miles of progress each month. A number of similar cases could be given where derelicts have been reported month after month in the highways of commerce.
