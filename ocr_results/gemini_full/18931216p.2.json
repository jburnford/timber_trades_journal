Every requisite for Coachbuilder and Cartwright on hand. Large stock of Seasoned Flooring and Lining.

They lie principally in what is called the North Wood and South Wood Plantations, in the neighbourhood of Blair, round Stormont Loch, Hallhole and elsewhere.\nThese woods are of easy access by good roads to Blairgowrie, Coupar-Angus, and Cargill Railway Stations.\nJOHN COWIE, Forester on the Estate, will point out the trees. Mr. DONALD MATHESON, Meikleour, will give particulars as to numbers, conditions of sale, &c., and offers will be received up to 31st January, 1894, by Mr. LOCKHART THOMSON, 114, George Street, Edinburgh.\n\nBLOWN TIMBER, PERTHSHIRE.\nFOR SALE by PRIVATE BARGAIN, on the ESTATE of ROSEMOUNT, NEAR BLAIRGOWRIE, a quantity of SCOTS FIR WOOD.\nThe Timber is of excellent quality, and lies quite close to good roads, about 1½ miles and 3 miles respectively from Blairgowrie and Coupar-Angus Stations.\nIt will be pointed out on application by the Griever at Rosemount. It will be sold either in One Lot or in Sections. Conditions of sale in the hands of Messrs. ANDERSON, CHAP-MAN, & CO., Solicitors, Blairgowrie, who will receive offers for the same.\n\nBLOWN TIMBER.—Large quantities of all kinds for SALE in Forfarshire. Apply to Messrs.

Also all kinds of HARDWOODS for MINING and COLLIERY purposes.—\"TIMBER, INVERNESS.\"\n\nthat such auction sales have not been over frequent in this market of late there was rather a small business done. The catalogue comprised pine and spruce deals of various qualities, and as an attractive feature, some lots bore the intimation \"without reserve.\" These apart, however, the attitude of sellers was very firm as regards prices, and although a good many offers were forthcoming as the various lots of 1st-quality pine deals, the offers did not meet the exposers' views. For 14 and 15 ft. 9 to 20 x 3, 1st pine deals with-drawn—the bidding was up to 3s. 2d. per cubic foot. At the close of the public sale of deals a good deal of time was occupied doing business by private bargain, and we believe that lots to a fair amount changed hands.\nThe company was afterwards conducted to Queen's Dock, where various parcels of logs, walnut, birch, whitewood, &c., were put up, but, perhaps, in account partly of the weather being very unfavourable for out-door selling, transactions publicly were limited to a few lots canary whitewood. Particulars of the prices obtained at this sale will be found below.\nAs regards the general outlook, the termination of the coal strike has brought a cheer-ing influence to trade in the district, and, from all accounts, the maintenance of an improved tone may be anticipated.\nThe principal arrival this week is the Prince Eugene, from Saguenay, a vessel of 1,287 tons; particulars of the cargo will be seen from the import page; the deals of this cargo are being stored at Yorkhill, and the spoolwood is being delivered to J. & P. Coats, Paisley.\nA cargo of Tabasco mahogany, of large dimensions, consigned here, per Elmwood, now on the way round from Falmouth.\n\nTelephone No. 997.\nCENTRAL SAW-MILLS, GALLOWGATE, GLASGOW.\nMahogany, Birch, Walnut, Ash, &c. Floorings, Linings, Mouldings, Architraves, &c.\nGARLAND & CO.,\nMERCHANTS & SAW-MILLERS,\nDUNBAR.\nWith wintry weather, and outside work somewhat interrupted, the course of trade is towards increased quietness, and it is unlikely any improvement will be felt until after the New Year holiday.\n\nAuction sale at Glasgow, on 13th inst., by Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co., brokers:—\nPer c. ft.\ns. d.\nOttawa 1st pine deals—\n16 ft. 10/21x3 2 3½\n12/13 ft. 7/10x3 1 11\nOttawa 3rd pine deals—\n9/12 ft. 11/20x3 1 1\n13/16 ft. 11x3 1 0¾\n12 ft. 11x3 0 10¾\n12/16 ft. 7/8x3 0 10\nOttawa 4th pine deals—\n12/16 ft. 11x3 0 10½\nQuebec 2nd spruce deals—\n6/13 ft. 6x3 0 9¾\nOttawa 3rd spruce deals—\n9/16 ft. 5/6x3 0 9¼\nQuebec canary whitewood 1s. 8d. & 1 9\n\nGREENOCK.\nThe routine character of the trade here to which we have now been for a very considerable time accustomed continues unchanged. On the whole there is a shrinkage in the extent of orders, but not to any greater amount than is looked for in the last weeks of the year. A healthy and hopeful tone pervades the trade, and the future is looked forward to with every confidence. Higher prices are looked for immediately, especially in pitch and yellow pines. Meantime stocks are low, and any augmentation for a long time will be only of the slightest. This week no timber-laden vessels have arrived, and there are only a very few on passage.\nThe lock-out of joiners from the Clyde shipyards is still maintained, and in all likelihood there will be no change now until after the New Year holiday. In local shipbuilding there is little new to record beyond the statement that Russell & Co. have booked a fresh order for two sailers of 2,750 tons each for a Glasgow firm.\nA large representation of the trade appeared at Edmiston & Mitchells' sale on the 7th inst., at which there was a limited business done publicly. One feature of the sale was the oft-repeated declinatures of the figures offered for waney boardwood, but we understand a number of the lots were afterwards cleared privately. The chief public transactions were:—\nLogs. C. ft.

Garland & Roger, and the vessel has been into Berwick under average. There are still one or two sailer cargoes of wood goods to arrive, if they have got safely through the recent gales, about which there is some uncertainty.\n\nDECEMBER 16, 1893.\nGAZETTE.\nPROCEEDINGS OF CREDITORS.\nMACFARLANE, JOHN, Builder, Glasgow.
