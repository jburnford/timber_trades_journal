REVIEWS.
*Running Feet To The St. Petersburg Standard*. By Mr. Reis. (London: Svensk Travaru-Tidning.)
A useful book of tables has just been published by Mr. Reis, the well-known London editor of our Swedish contemporary, compiled for the purpose of showing at a glance the system of a third of a Petersburg standard divisor, the benefit of which is a great saving and accuracy in calculation. The result, especially applicable to the monetary system of this country, with even the rate of exchange, are everywhere apparent. Finland, and showing the value in France.
Waterloo Bros., London, have sent us their 'Surveyors' and Auctioneers' Diary and Tables for 1894.' London: Waterloo Bros., Limited.
This is a well-known and very useful publication, well got up, well printed, and conveniently arranged. The information given is very concise, and will be found serviceable to the trade generally, and to those in whose hands it falls, interests beyond the timber trade. The interest and value of the book, with its quality, and one page to each day for notes. An alphabetical index is given, and a reference to the various sections of the value of the book is enhanced generally.
LOAD-LINE. A correspondent writes to the London correspondent of the Board of Trade, under date of Dec. 11, as follows:-"The Board of Trade, under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1890, allow steamers to load to their summer marks at Newport News, and other American ports, and three inches deeper in the winter time than they can load from Philadelphia and other northern ports. I can find no one who can explain this."
LETTER BOXES. - We have received from the office, and saw-mill furnishing department of Messrs. John Foulke's successors, Birmingham, a sample of their letters left unopened. We should certainly adopt Foulke's safety envelope, which would absolutely prevent any tampering with private letters, &c., from taking place. The secret is that the letter falls into the box, and is cut open by a knife with serrated edges. The construction of the pivot, thus rendering the abstraction of the letters impossible from the outside. The principal Oak from Courgnaud, of Paris, and 87a, Commercial-street, London, E., is the sole manufacturer.
