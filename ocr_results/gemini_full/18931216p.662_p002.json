Hornell, Stockholm, the editor of our Swedish contemporary. It is compiled for the benefit of those who work on the system of a thousandth part of a St.Petersburg standard instead of the ordinary 165 divisor, the benefit of this being a considerable saving and a far greater precision in the result. The system is more especially applicable where the decimal exists. All sizes are treated with, even the most uncommon. The tables are everywhere adopted in Scandinavia and Finland, and should find a sale here and in France.\n\nLayton's Architects', Surveyors', and Auctioneers' Diary and Almanac for 1894. London: Waterlow Bros. & Layton, Ltd.\nThis is a well-known and much appreciated publication, well bound, carefully compiled, and conveniently arranged. The information given is very comprehensive, being especially serviceable to the professions mentioned above, and to those in the building trades having interests beyond their own circle it is also of interest and value. The paper is of excellent quality, and one page is provided for each day's notes. An alphabetical index is also provided, and a reference to the table of contents is proof of the value of the diary to commercial men generally.\n\nLOAD-LINE REGULATIONS.—\"Shipbroker\" writes to the London press to know why the Board of Trade, under their Load-line Regulations, allow steamers sailing from Baltimore, Newport News, and Norfolk to load about six inches deeper in the winter time than steamers from Philadelphia, New York, &c., as he can find no one who can justify this difference.\nLETTER BOXES are indispensable in every office, and saw-mill owners and others having their letters left at their yards should adopt Foulke's safety letter box, which absolutely prevents the abstraction of letters, &c., from the interior. Immediately the letter falls into the box it is protected by a knife with serrated edges worked on a centre pivot, thus rendering letters impossible from the outside. The Gospel Oak Iron Company, Ltd., of Wolverhampton, and 675, Commercial Road East, London, are the sole manufacturers of this excellent device.\n\n(689)\nHOME-GROWN TIMBER.\nAUCTION SALE.\nParticulars of the most important forthcoming sales of home-grown timber will be found in our advertising pages.\nNORTHAMPTONSHIRE.—On Monday, Messrs. Holloway, Son, & Price conducted a successful sale of timber, principally elm of medium quality, on the Deane Park Estate, Northampton. There was a good attendance of buyers, including Messrs. Geo. Miles, English Bros., Spendlove, Weldon, Beeby & Sons, and E. Dexter & Co. The elm realised from 10d. to 1s. per foot, and the rates for the oak were from 1s. 6d. to 2s. per foot.\n\nWANTED: A LITTLE ENTERPRISE.\nDr. Schlich, lately the head of the Indian Forestry Department, estimates that there are nearly 8,000,000 acres of waste land in England, and that one-half of this could be profitably laid down as forest land. He has planted 800 acres near Ascot for the instruction of those attending his school, the labourers employed thereon receiving 3s. a day. This eminent authority calculates that almost any land that could be obtained for £10 an acre would pay to plant with Scotch firs. He suggests that an area of 2,000 acres might be taken for an experiment which, under the guidance of an expert forester, could not fail to yield a profit.\n\nAMERICAN IMAGINATION.\nOur American cousins are celebrated for indulging in tall talk, but we hardly expected the Bluenoses to follow in the same groove. According to the ideas of some one of our Canadian contemporaries, the forest growth of Great Britain consists of sticks and bean poles, and the length and dimensions of the oak and elm from the parks of our nobility are generally about 10 feet in the stem. We notice the writer particularly refrained from going into the question of girth. Somebody in America said that the trees in his country were so big that it took a day to walk round the trunk. This kind of bounce is all very well while there is no one to dispute the statement; but now that most people have travelled a bit, a more modest estimate of the undoubtedly gigantic trees that flourish on the other side of the Atlantic would become our cousins better. In the old country there are trees growing which in girth would equal many of the biggest trees of the world. A visit to some of our parks here might have given the Canadian visitor something to think over. We fear his digestion must have been a little disorganised crossing the \"herring pond,\" when he jumped so hastily to the conclusion that English forests were made up of bean poles and brushwood.\n\nSALE OF IRISH TIMBER.\nAn action to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract to sell and deliver timber has been heard at Dublin. The defence was that there was no contract. The plaintiffs, Messrs. Sankey Brothers, timber merchants, of Waterford, saw an advertisement by the defendants, gentlemen farmers, who reside at Velvetstown, near Buttevant, that they had 371 ash trees for sale. A correspondence took place between the parties, and the plaintiff said in a letter that he would give £200 for the trees, on condition that any of them that should be found rotten or defective should be replaced by others. Plaintiff alleged that after that the defendants made an appointment by letter with him to go and see the trees, and that when he did so he was told by the defendant's son that they had been sold to another person. After the plaintiff had been examined counsel for the defendant asked for a direction on the ground that there was no agreement that satisfied Section 17 of the Statute of Frauds. The defendant's son, Mr. C. Crofts, deposed that he sold the trees for £187 10s. to a Mr. Murphy. The learned judge directed a verdict for the defendants.\n\nREAFFORESTING IN IRELAND.\nIn the House of Commons on Wednesday Mr. Field asked whether the Government was prepared to grant, out of the funds voted for reafforesting in Ireland, a sufficient sum to start the planting of willow and osiers in suitable localities; and whether instructions will be issued to the Congested Districts Board to immediately promote this reproductive industry. Mr. Bryce, for Mr. J. Morley, said:—The Congested Districts Board have already planted about two acres of land in the county of Galway with osiers, as an experiment, and are willing to consider any scheme submitted to them relative to the development of osier cultivation, and—having due regard to other claims upon the Board's resources—to assist in developing any such schemes which, in their opinion, may reasonably be expected to be successful.\n\nTHE CITY DIARY, 1894, is to hand in its familiar and useful form, containing the usual information relating to civic authorities and Corporation matters. The diary pages are well suited for short memoranda, and the size is about the best that could have been selected for the purpose. Messrs. W. H. & L. Collingridge, of the City Press Office, are the publishers of this diary, now in its thirty-first year.\n\nTHE EFFECT OF STRIKES, said a large contractor at a recent meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce in Paris, was disastrous. In 1878 the carpenters struck for an advance on their wages of seven francs, with the result that builders employ iron planks for the floorings of the upper stories of houses, which had previously been laid down in wood. So with the introduction of Norwegian windows and doors.\n\nNEW GRAVING DOCK AT SOUTHAMPTON.—The London and South-Western Railway Company have come to the determination to proceed with the work of their new graving dock at Southampton (the largest in the world) in three sections, and thus, instead of its remaining in hand for two or three years, it is hoped it will be finished by July or August. An important alteration is then in contemplation, which will greatly affect the comfort and convenience of Atlantic and Cape passengers. At present the North German Lloyd, Hamburg American, and the Castle Line vessels anchor in Southampton Water, and take their passengers and mails on board by tenders, or vice versa. By the dredging of the channel, which will enable vessels of any size to reach port at any state of the tide, these mail steamers will proceed straight to the new quay walls, which will, so to speak, be ocean railway stations, trains running straight to the ship's side, so that passengers for any port will simply have to step from the train on to the ship. Many other great improvements are being effected, especially as to a complete system of hydraulics throughout the entire dock, and the lighting up of the whole system with electricity.\n\nTO INVENTORS.—General Patent Office Established 1830. G. F. REDFERN & CO., 4, South Street, Finsbury, London. Provisional Protection for nine months under the New Act, £3 3s.; to complete the Patent for four years, £7 7s.

ELLIOTT,\n80, WEST STREET, SHEFFIELD.\n\nIRELAND.\nThe late coal dispute had a disastrous effect on the native timber trade of Ireland, and such towns as Wicklow suffered most severely, the shipments of native wood being entirely stopped.\nThe timber trade in the Antrim district has been fairly good during the season, one cause of the activity being the successful harvest enjoyed by the farmers. The prospects for the coming season are also satisfactory, and as the stocks are much lower than last year the prices of building materials and timber generally should be firmer than has lately been the case.\n\nGUERNSEY.\nThe growing of timber for trade purposes in this island is nil, the area being much too limited to encourage this line of industry. As a consequence the supply is not equal to the demand, and the trade is greatly dependent on imports. The demand is also limited. During the past eight years a number of trees have been felled, principally elm, to make room for the erection of glass houses, early produce being one of the principal exports of the island.",
