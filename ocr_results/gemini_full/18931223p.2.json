Bell & Sime, Ltd. had a large and very representative company at their sale on Monday. The sale was held at the firm's Dundee Saw-mills and Dock Street Mill. A large quantity of regular stock was placed at prices similar to those realised at recent sales, while the special and without reserve lots were placed at prices which would in most instances please buyers.\nGLASGOW.\nDeliveries of deals from the public yards at Yorkhill, &c., are well maintained, and are telling now more especially on the stocks of Quebec deals, as the weekly arrivals per steam liners from the St. Lawrence are closed for the season; a good demand for this class of goods, particularly 1st pine, has been experienced for some time past, and there has been no undue accumulation of stock.\nThe import list of the past week is a short one, but comprises several items of importance; among these are the cargo of spruce deals per \"Cambusdoon,\" from St. John, N.B. (1,132 tons reg.), a considerable portion of which is going direct into consumers' hands and the rest being stored for sale by Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.\n\nThe Timber Trades Journal SCOTCH SUPPLEMENT.\nCENTRAL SAW-MILLS, GALLOWGATE,\nMahogany, Birch, Walnut, Ash, &c. Floorings, Linings, Mouldings, Architraves, &c.\nGARLAND & CO.,\nMERCHANTS & SAW-MILLERS,\nEvery requisite for Coachbuilder and Cartwright\nYellow Pine and Hardwood Boards\nCo., and there is the cargo per \"Sawhold,\" from Bathurst, a vessel about 1,300 tons register, containing pine and spruce deals for Messrs. Robinson, Dunn, & Co. and being carted direct to their mills, with the exception of a small portion to be piled at Yorkhill. An import of special interest to mahogany buyers is the cargo per \"Elm-wood,\" from Laguna, consigned to Messrs. William Connal & Co.; it has been in course of discharge at Queen's Dock for the past few days, and is to be brought to auction on Thursday next, the 28th December; while there is in the cargo an attractive variety of dimensions, it is remarkable for the number of large logs it contains, the cargo averaging about 26 in. deep, and the quality is turning out very good.\nAs wood of this description has been scarce in this market, the present cargo will, no doubt, be appreciated; and we anticipate a large attendance of the trade for Thursday next.\nThe mahogany sale is to be followed by Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells, who will offer parcels of walnut, whitewood, and ash logs, walnut boards, &c.\nGREENOCK.\nThe Quebec imports are now finally closed with the arrival of the long-delayed \"Reciprocity,\" which vessel, it will be remembered, had to put into Halifax dis-abled. The cargo is for Singleton, Dunn, & Co., and is being discharged in the James Watt Dock. No other timber-laden vessels have arrived during the week, and only an occasional cargo of pitch pine will now be looked for; and even of this wood, for a considerable time now, the import has been exceptionally light. The annual statement of stocks at the end of the present month will be perused with interest, and will show a large diminution in some of the leading kinds. Business is steadily quickening as the holidays get nearer, and deliveries from the ponds are light, pitch pine being the chief article moving.\nThe shipbuilding returns for 1893 have now been compiled, and show a falling off in Greenock and Port Glasgow of 47 per cent. when compared with the preceding year. This is sufficient to emphasise the unsatis-factory condition of this industry at present. The total tonnage launched in 1893 is 77,257 tons, whilst in 1892 the total was 145,796 tons. Russell & Co. again easily out-distance all competitors, having built no less than 47,093 tons of the above total.\nLEITH.\nWith the exception of 2,333 deals per \"Livonia\" (s), from Riga, there are practically no arrivals of wood goods to report, and trade gets more and more circumscribed as the end of the year is approached. There is nothing, however, unusual in this state of matters, and in the face of shippers' advanced prices for the coming season importers are firm in seeking to have, at least, a living profit out of their stocks.\nThe \"Alma\" (s), from Baltimore, is just reported as arrived with some whitewood and hickory logs, but particulars are not yet forthcoming.\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nDec. 14 Kathinka-Fredriksvoer-3 lds. firewood—C.
