Franklin & Jones presided over an attendance which could not be called large. The lots comprised 222 clean oaks of fair quality, a few good elm and ash trees, and about 30 acres of excellent underwood. Oak fetched from 1s. 3d. to 1s. 6d., elm 10d., and ash 1s. 3d. per cubic foot. The principal buyers were Messrs. Mulford Bros., Greywell, Hants; Twine, Wootton Bassett, Wilts; Geo. Lyneham, Wilts; Jarvis, Grove, Berks; Dixon, Bourton, Dorset; and Hodgkins, Faringdon.\nWORCESTERSHIRE.-A crowded saleroom was to be seen at the Crown Hotel, Worcester, yesterday week, when Mr. Bentley knocked down 38 lots of timber, principally of elm and ash, on Earl Beauchamp's estates, to the tune of no less than Â£4,930. The elm realised 8d. to 10d. per ft. and the ash 1s. 4d. to 1s. 6d. A list of buyers shows the representative character of the gathering, the most prominent bidders being Messrs. J. Crook, High Wycombe; J. Glover, Walsall; Wilesmith, Malvern Link; J. Roberts & Cooper, Brierley Hill; Espley & Co., Evesham; Ivens, Rugby; Child & Co., High Wycombe; Hale Bros., Walsall; Cope, Derby; Vibert, Gloucester; Corbett & Son, Chaddesley, Kidderminster; Rudden & Son, Birmingham; Workman, Woodchester, Stroud; Smith Bros., Cheltenham; and Humphries, Pershore.\nDULNESS IN LANCASHIRE.\nThe home-grown timber trade of Lancashire is in a very unsatisfactory condition, and around Manchester there is a general complaint of the supply being greater than the demand. Prices for round and converted timber are very low, in keeping with the dulness prevailing throughout most Lancashire industries.",
