T., Middlesborough ... ... ... £ s. d. 252 0 0\nHarrighan & Harrison, West Hartlepool ... ... 112 7 0\nHollis Bros., Leicester ... ... ... ... 75 0 0\nLane, C. S., West Hartlepool ... ... ... 208 10 6\n\nFAULKNER, A. E., builder and contractor, Apple Tree Yard, St. James’s Square.—The bankrupt attended for his public examination on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Hope. The accounts showed liabilities £2,413 9s. 1d., of which £2,269 14s. are expected to rank, and estimated net assets £300 10s. 5d. It appeared that the bankrupt commenced business (which was left to him by his uncle, in whose employ he had been for many years) in July, 1890, without capital, at the above address, where he has traded down to the date of the receiving order. He attributes his insolvency to loss on a contract, want of capital, to the heavy expenses of his business premises, to accommodation bill, and to law costs. Mr. Howell attended as Assistant Receiver, and, having examined the bankrupt, his Honour ordered the examination to be concluded.\n\nFOX, THOMAS RYLE, builder, Parkstone.—This bankrupt last week attended at the Poole Bankruptcy Court last week, before the Registrar, Mr. Dickinson, for his public examination. The liabilities amounted to £1,838 7s. 7d., of which £1,370 2s. 3d. is expected to rank for dividend, and assets estimated at £238 7s. Mr. F. Aston Dawes represented the Board of Trade, and Mr. F. Travers the bankrupt, who stated that he commenced business as a speculative builder about twelve months ago, with a capital of £50. He had kept no books of account. Action had been brought against him by a firm of timber merchants, and he defended same, but he now admitted that he had no defence, and took the course he did in order to obtain time. The examination was closed. The following is the list of creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBlanchard, John, Poole ... ... ... ... 18 13 8\nChambers & Co., London ... ... ... ... 85 6 5\nCheadle, G., & Co., Wolverhampton ... ... 55 6 9\nHiscock Bros., London ... ... ... ... 12 1 9\nMarsden, J., & Son, Liverpool ... ... ... 12 17 11\nPoole, Baltic & Quebec Timber Company, Limited, Poole ... ... ... ... 29 1 8\nRobbins & Co., Bristol ... ... ... ... 14 6 7\nSellers & Son, Parkstone ... ... ... ... 30 3 7\nSharp, Jones, & Co., Limited, Poole ... ... 18 8 8\n\nHOBBS, JAMES, cabinet maker, Arcade, Newcastle-on-Tyne.—The following are among the creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nChristie & Miller, Falkirk ... ... ... ... 37 19 3\nGrey, Jos., Newcastle ... ... ... ... 70 15 4\nLockey, Geo.

The Official Receiver said the debtor was an undischarged bankrupt. He became bankrupt in 1888 on the petition of a creditor. He went to America, where he remained until 1891, when he returned, and continued to carry on the same business as previously, but he again became insolvent. He did not surrender for his public examination, which on that occasion was adjourned sine die. Finally it was decided to adjourn the examination to enable the debtor to apply for the examination under his former failure to be closed.\n\nLAKE, WALTER, barge builder, West Cottage Wharf, Iron Bridge, and 32, Portia Street, Poplar, E.—This debtor has filed his petition, and on Saturday, upon the application of Messrs. Keene, Marsland, & Co., a receiving order was granted. The assets are stated to consist of a stock of timber, plant, and materials, estimated to realise £200. There are no book debts, and the household furniture belongs chiefly to the debtor’s wife. An adjudication of bankruptcy was also made. The amount of the liabilities was not stated.\n\nMAYER, WM., timber merchant, 126, Norwood Road, S.E.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Hope on Wednesday, and upon the application of Mr. W. H. Hales, a receiving order was made. The proceedings were upon the petition of Messrs. Moger & Co., of Norwood, the act of bankruptcy alleged being the non-compliance of the debtor with the requirements of the usual statutory notice. No particulars transpired.\n\nMILLS, G. F., joiner and builder, Orchard Street and Rupert Road, Nether Edge, Sheffield. —This bankrupt was publicly examined on Thursday last week, before his Honour Judge Ellison, at the Sheffield Bankruptcy Court. The debtor’s summary of accounts showed liabilities amounting to £824, and the assets were estimated to produce £67. The Official Receiver asked that the examination might be adjourned until the next Court, in order that he might be able to go into the accounts more fully. His Honour granted the application.\n\nTIMBER MERCHANTS,\nATHERTON & CO., 140, LEADENHALL ST., E.C.\n(Next door to the London Joint Stock Bank.)\nLARGE STOCKS OF SEASONED\nMAHOGANY AND TEAK\nto all thicknesses and widths.\nMahogany, Cedar, and Teak Panel.\nAmerican and Italian Walnut.\nWe usecot Oak, Ash, Birch, &c.\nPlanks.\n\nTelegraphic Address—“ACAJOU, LONDON.” Telephone No. 11,020.\nROBERT GARRARD & CO.,\nMahogany and Timber Merchants,\n206, BETHNAL GREEN ROAD, LONDON, E.\nContractors to Railway and Rolling Stock Companies.\n\nMORGAN, C. H., & MORGAN, F., builders, Bevois Valley, Southampton.—These debtors appeared for their adjourned public examination at the Southampton County Court on Thursday week. In reply to the trustee, Mr. Wilding, of Clements Lane, London, the debtor Isted said that the balance of £650 owing to the National Bank was due from the firm, although the account was in his own name. When things were going on all right certain property was transferred to Mrs. C. H. Morgan, because he had a prior claim through £500 extra capital. It was lodged with the bank as security for an overdraft. Mr. C. H. Morgan corroborated that statement, and said the reversion mentioned in his private statement of affairs was the only property he had. The Registrar observed that the debtors had filed a separate statement of their affairs. Mr. Linthorne, who appeared for the debtors, said that Mr. Isted had no separate estate. After the debtor Isted had been briefly examined by Mr. Emanuel, who appeared for the creditors, and the Official Receiver, the examination was ordered to be closed.\n\nSCOTT, WILLIAM, builder, of 25, Sugden Road, Lavender Hill, Wandsworth, S.W.—Mr. Alexander Mackintosh, Official Receiver of the Wandsworth district, has issued particulars of this failure. The gross liabilities are £7,705 11s. 7d., of which, however, only £99 1s. is expected to rank for dividend, and deficiency is stated at the latter amount.\n\nTAYLOR BROS., builders, Hastings.—The above debtors made an application for their discharge at the last sitting of the Hastings Bankruptcy Court. Mr. Langham, who appeared for the debtors, said the report of the Official Receiver was a fair and proper one. After his Honour had read the Official Receiver’s report Mr. Langham said the purchase of the Swan Hotel property in 1881 was the last speculation the debtors had entered into, as subsequently they only went in for contract work. It was not so much deficiency of assets as want of capital that had brought about their downfall. The Official Receiver said the deficiency really amounted to £7,000. Mr. Langham said that large amount was caused through one of the mortgagees preferring to give up his security and rank as an unsecured creditor. He contended that the bankruptcy had been caused through misfortune. His Honour said the most important question was whether the bankrupts had been guilty of rash and hazardous speculation. Mr. Langham argued that the debtors considered they had good security in their property, but there had been a great fall in the value of house property at Hastings during the past five years. The Official Receiver said that whilst he thought there had been rash and hazardous speculation, he considered that the debtors were honest, hard-working men. They were formerly carpenters, and with a capital of £200 each they built property to the value of £52,000. He did not wish to press the case at all, but as a matter of principle he submitted that there had been rash and hazardous speculation. In reply to his Honour it was stated that the ages of the debtors were fifty-two and fifty-three respectively. The discharge was suspended for three years in each case.\n\nWATSON, JOHN, builder, 2, Bawdale Road, Lordship Lane, Dulwich, S.E.—The report of the Official Receiver in this matter shows liabilities amounting to £1,020, of which £846 is expected to rank for dividend. The assets are estimated to produce £290.\n\nDETAILED SPECIFICATION\nON APPLICATION.\n—TELEPHONE No. 1608.—\n\nDRY PINE and SEQUOIA\nIN all thicknesses and widths.\nMAHOGANY and other Knives cut\nVENEERS, CURLS, &c.\nLOGS Mahogany, Teak, Walnut, and other Log Timber supplied in Tiers or single Logs.\nSpecifications on application.",
