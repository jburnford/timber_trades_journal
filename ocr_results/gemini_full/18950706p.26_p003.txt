Witness and his brother had in April last executed a mortgage of saw-mills and machinery to a creditor named Foster, and the landlord had distrained for rent. He had also executed a bill of sale of his furniture to Foster in respect of the same debt. There were £27 due on account of a contract at Confeakle, and he had assigned that to Foster. The mortgage, bill of sale, and assignment were all in respect of moneys due before that time. There was no fresh execution, and no money passed at the time the instruments were executed. That was all the property of the firm except about £130, which he calculated was due to him on account of a contract for the building of a house at Mount Irwin, the completion of which had been taken up by the architect on terms of the contract. The Court gave Mr. Davoren leave to be advised by counsel as to the effect of the evidence.

ELLIOTT, JOSEPH N., of Woolsley Road, Beddington, Surrey, and JOHN HYNE, of 31, Algrave Road, Earlsfield, S W., trading as Elliott & Hyne, builders and contractors, lately of Bush Hill Park, Enfield.—The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this failure took place at the offices of the Official Receiver, 95, Temple Chambers, Temple Avenue, E.C., under the presidency of Mr. Halcombe, Assistant Official Receiver. The Chairman, after reading over the proofs of debts lodged, said the debtors had only just filed their statement of affairs, from which it appeared that the unsecured liabilities amounted to £695 4s. 7d.; the assets were set down at £112 8s., of which £50 was due from certain building land, and was stated to be in the hands of debtors' solicitors. In reply to the Chairman, the meeting resolved to defer asking the debtors any questions until they appeared for their public examination, when they would be upon oath. It was proposed that Mr. J. C. Halton, of 110, Cannon Street, E.C., be appointed trustee. Another creditor proposed that Mr

Barker stated : "We found on making up our balance-sheet after stocktaking there had been considerable losses in trading, amounting to some thousands of pounds, and this we could not account for until it was found there had been a systematic diversion of business from our establishment by Mr. Burden trading on his own account, comprising to a large extent the more paying portion of the business, which was done without our knowledge." Debtor, while admitting that he had been doing a little business on his own account for some time prior to leaving Barker Brothers' employment, denied that he had diverted their business. Examined as to his dealings with Mr. F. J. Cope, whom he described as a middleman, the debtor stated that at the time of his bankruptcy the books showed that Cope was indebted to him to the extent of £2,000. He asserted that he had no interest whatever in the business carried on by his brother, Mr. Wilfrid Burden, at Montgomery. Witness was at present employed by Mr. W. H. Emery, of Chesterton, at a salary of £2 weekly and a small commission on profits. The examination was again adjourned, the debtor being ordered to furnish the accounts required by the Official Receiver by the 4th July.

CHARLES, R. E., formerly sawyer, Norway Wharf, Hertford Road, Kingsland, N.E.—The debtor, now of St. Michael's Road, Bowes Park, commercial traveller, formerly carried on business as above under the style of the Norway Saw-mills and Box Company. He has filed his petition, and on Tuesday a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Giffard. He states that he gave up business at Norway Wharf about three years ago and has since been a commercial traveller. The rent of his private house was in arrear, but the landlord was not in possession. He valued the furniture at about £50, but it was covered by a bill of sale, and he had no other assets. The amount of the liabilities was not stated. An order of adjudication was also made.

COOKE, D. F., senr., builder, 17, Coleman Street, E. C.—A sitting for the bankrupt's public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The accounts showed unsecured debts, £2,778 15s. 3d.; and debts fully secured, £73,869; assets, £1 830. In reply to Mr. G. Wreford, Official Receiver, the bankrupt said that during the last twenty years he had carried on speculative building operations, principally in the City. His capital was represented chiefly by equities of redemption in the mortgaged property. He failed to let the properties satisfactorily, and the payments for ground rents, interest, and other outgoings more than absorbed the income. About three years ago he considered that his equities were worth about £50,000, and that he was then worth about £11,000 to the good, but he feared that the surplus had since disappeared The bankrupt was also questioned by the trustee upon his accounts, and his examination was then ordered to be concluded.

DUNWOODY, ANDREW & WM. J., builders and contractors.—The bankrupts carried on business at Armagh. Wm. J. Dunwoody has left the country. Andrew Dunwoody was examined by Mr. Carton, Q.C. (instructed by Mr. Davoren), at the Dublin Bankruptcy Court on Friday, before Judge Miller, and said that his brother went away about three weeks ago. He had since written from Toronto stating that he had landed there.

Cooper Corbett, chartered accountant, be appointed trustee, and the latter proposition was eventually carried. The Chairman said he did not think an outside trustee was necessary in this case, but the creditors were of opinion that there were several matters which required investigation, and that an independent trustee would be able to devote more time to the matter than the Official Receiver. The following gentlemen were then proposed as a committee of inspection :—Mr. J. South, of Edmonton ; Mr. Starter, of Enfield ; and Mr. William Elston Cullen, of Cullen & Co., ladder and barrow makers, Southampton Street, Camberwell, two to form a quorum. The remuneration of the trustee was left to the committee of inspection, and the trustee's bond was fixed at £120.

The statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed gross liabilities amounting to £1,401 12s 9d. of which £497 10s. 5d. was due to unsecured creditors ; and the value of the securities being estimated at £1,080, thus showing an estimated surplus of £234 15s. 10d., which is carried out as an asset to meet "other liabilities," £42; total liabilities expected to rank against the estate

BURDEN, ROBERT, lately a timber merchant at Gwersyllt—At Chester Castle, before Mr. Registrar Giles, this debtor attended for his adjourned public examination in bankruptcy. The debtor has failed with a deficiency of over £57,000. In answer to the Official Receiver, Mr. Ll. Hugh Jones, he stated that he had as yet been unable to file the accounts ordered at the last sitting, but he promised to do so within the next few days. The Official Receiver stated that he had communicated with Messrs. Barker Brothers, of Shrewsbury, by whom the debtor was employed as outside manager at a salary of £250 a year. Messrs. Barker replied that debtor was with them from 1879 to 1891, and they left him a considerable share in the management of the business. At the end of August, 1891, he, being away unwell, wrote tendering his resignation, which was accepted. Shortly afterwards an accountant was called in to examine the books, and while he was doing so debtor wrote to a friend named Woodhouse offering to pay Messrs. Barker £2,000 in satisfaction of their claim. This was ultimately accepted, and, wishing to close a most painful episode, Messrs. Barker did not proceed with the audit further, but they had gone far enough to find that the £2,000 would not by any means repay them what was due. Debtor said he could not explain how he had become indebted to Barker Brothers to the extent of £2,000. The Registrar: You are a business man of considerable experience. Do you mean to say you paid £2,000 away without knowing what it was for? Debtor : I cannot give you details. The Official Receiver stated that Barker Brothers informed him that the £2,000 did not include anything for money lent, nor anything for timber supplied. Debtor was paid by salary, and not commission. In another letter Messrs.
