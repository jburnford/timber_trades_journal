J. Dibb), at the Manchester Bankruptcy Court, recently, as to the circumstances of his failure.\nThe liabilities expected to rank against his estate amount to £28,417, and assets are expected to realise only £819, leaving a deficiency of £27,597.\nThe debtor was asked as to the answers given by his brother in the course of his examination a short time ago.\nHe confirmed those answers except in three or four minor details.\nHe agreed with his brother that it was owing to the failure of Mr. Robert Burden, timber merchant, that the firm of Thrutchley Brothers had been brought down.\nIt transpired that the shareholders had manifested their faith in the integrity of the Messrs. Thrutchley by stipulating that if the company were reconstructed the debtors must retain their positions in the management.\nThe Official Receiver said the debtors had done all they could to help him in the matter.\nHe only wished that gentlemen who came into the hands of the Court would be as considerate as they had been.\nThe examination was adjourned.\n\nBANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.\nADAMS, ALFRED, builder, 27, Shaftesbury Court, Haro-sey Rise.\nFirst meeting, Bankruptcy Court, July 12 at 2½.\nExamination, Bankruptcy Court, August 7 at 11.\nBROWNS, JAMES, wood merchant and top maker, 4, St. Andrew's Terrace, and Hope Buildings, 151, Sun-bridge Road, Bradford.\nReceiving Order, July 5.\nAdjudication, July 5.\nCHARLES, ROBERT EDMUND, late trading as the Norway Saw-mills and Box Co., late sawyer and box maker, 39, St. Michael's Road, Bowes Park, Wood Green, late Norway Wharf, Hertford Road, Kingsland, traveller.\nReceiving Order, July 2.\nAdjudication, July 2.\nCHISLETT, HERBERT WARE, Hill Street, Poole, and ARTHUR WELLESLEY NOYES LEWIS, Camden Studios, Camden Street, Camden Town, trading at Hamside, Poole, yachts and launch builders.\nAdjudication, July 1.\nFARR, THOMAS, builder, 23, St. Austell Street, Truro.\nReceiving Order, July 1.\nFirst meeting, Official Receiver, Truro, July 13 at 12½.\nExamination, Townhall, Truro, July 20 at 11½.\nAdjudication, July 1.\nGULLETT, FRED, and FRANK BAKER GULLETT, builders, Spencer Road, Wealdstone, Harrow.\nReceiving Order, July 2.\nHALL, ARTHUR, builder, 59, Lichfield Street, Hanley.\nReceiving Order, July 5.\nAdjudication, July 5.\nHAWKINS & Co., both wood furniture manufacturers, 133 and 135, Old Street, St. Luke's, 1 and 2, New Street, Old Street, 133, Central Street, and 27A, Powell Street.\nFirst meeting, Bankruptcy Court, August 1 at 12.\nExamination, Bankruptcy Court, August 1 at 12.\n\nHUSKISSON DOCK.\nJuly 12 Potts & Redhead; 100 oak planks\nJuly 12 Farnworth & Jardine; 131 walnut logs, 769 ash logs, 309 oak planks\nJuly 13 Philadelphia (s)—Boston—3,800 bdls. oak staves—Farnworth & Jardine; 603 pcs. walnut\n\nLANGTON DOCK.\nJuly 9 Ancyra—Halifax, N.S.—6,709 hardwood deals and battens—A.

Cobbett & Co. refer is contained in the prospectus of the West African Mahogany and Petroleum Company, Limited.\nThat some shipments have paid from 20 to 70 per cent. is quite true —we know of one shipment of three logs which must have returned the fortunate owner at least 25 times their value on the coast—but such results must be put against the fact that hundreds of logs sold at 2½d. to 3d. per foot have resulted most disastrously to the shippers.—ED. T.T.J.]\n\nTHE PROGRESS OF HULL.—The English Illustrated Magazine for July has a reproduction of an article and picture \"The Wood Gatherers\" and a third sketch on Mr. C. H. Wilson, of Hull.\nEvery ship due at Hull belongs to Thomas Wilson & Sons, and about 500 clerks are employed in their offices at the docks.\nHull has the oldest dock, being the Queen's, which was opened in 1778.",
