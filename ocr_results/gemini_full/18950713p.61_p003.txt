INSURANCE AGAINST BAD DEBTS.
MERCHANTS AND TRADERS
MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS
OCEAN ACCIDENT & GUARANTEE CORPORATION, LIMITED.
40, 42, & 44, MOORGATE STREET, LONDON, E.C.
Established 1871.
Subscribed Capital, £285,000.

He went to Pwllheli from South Wales about four years ago.
He had built three houses at Pwllheli at a cost of £1,300 and mortgaged them for £1,450.
He owed the Metropolitan Bank at Pwllheli £578, and as security they held bills of exchange signed by himself and two or three other parties.
At one time they also held a life policy, but as he had been unable to pay more than one premium, consequently the policy had lapsed.
The examination was finally ordered to be adjourned.

SMITH, HARRY, S.W.—The receiving order in this case was made on June 20th, upon a creditor's petition, the debtor being also described as late of Still Hall Gardens, Kew Bridge, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday.
The debtor has not attended under the proceedings, and is stated to be away at the seaside, his mind being impaired.
Having called over the proofs, the Chairman said he was informed that the debtor had not been in business during the last twelve months, and was quite incapable of managing his affairs.
After some discussion, resolutions were passed to wind up the estate in bankruptcy, with Mr. Edward Hobbs, accountant, Old Jewry, E.C., as trustee.
A committee of Mr. Wiggins (T. & W. Farmiloe), consisting of Mr. Hardy.
The public examination is fixed for the 30th inst.

THRUTCHLEY, WILLIAM, a member of the firm of Thrutchley Brothers, Limited, and residing at Lyndholme, Knutsford, was examined by the Official Receiver (Mr. C. J. Dibb), at the Manchester Bankruptcy Court, recently, as to the circumstances of his failure.
The liabilities expected to rank against his estate amount to £28,417, and assets are expected to realise only £819, leaving a deficiency of £27,597.
The debtor was asked as to the answers given by his brother in the course of his examination a short time ago.
He confirmed those answers except in three or four minor details.
He agreed with his brother that it was owing to the failure of Mr. Robert Burden, timber merchant, that the firm of Thrutchley Brothers had been brought down.
It transpired that the shareholders had manifested their faith in the integrity of the Messrs. Thrutchley by stipulating that if the company were reconstructed the debtors must retain their positions in the management.
The Official Receiver said the debtors had done all they could to help him in the matter.
He only wished that gentlemen who came into the hands of the Court would be as considerate as they had been.
The examination was adjourned.

CORRESPONDENCE.
AFRICAN MAHOGANY PROFITS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—The gentleman who writes your Liverpool hardwood and mahogany reports seems to have concluded that mahogany has been selling at considerably below cost, and that the supply in the near future will be diminished.
We, therefore, think it desirable to call his attention to the statement, backed by four merchants of high standing and credit, published in the second column of page 14 of your issue of July 6th, that shipments of African mahogany to Liverpool has been an average while one addition yielded a net profit of 20 per cent.
It would seem to us that shippers are making profits of 70 per cent., let alone the diminution in the supplies of mahogany.
Perhaps your Liverpool correspondent, who no doubt knows all about it, will explain.—Yours faithfully,
COBBETT & Co.
Hackney Triangle, London, July 8th.

[The statement to which Messrs. Cobbett & Co. refer is contained in the prospectus of the West African Mahogany and Petroleum Company, Limited.
That some shipments have paid from 20 to 70 per cent. is quite true —we know of one shipment of three logs which must have returned the fortunate owner at least 25 times their value on the coast—but such results must be put against the fact that hundreds of logs sold at 2½d. to 3d. per foot have resulted most disastrously to the shippers.—ED. T.T.J.]

THE PROGRESS OF HULL.—The English Illustrated Magazine for July has a reproduction of an article and picture "The Wood Gatherers" and a third sketch on Mr. C. H. Wilson, of Hull.
Every ship due at Hull belongs to Thomas Wilson & Sons, and about 500 clerks are employed in their offices at the docks.
Hull has the oldest dock, being the Queen's, which was opened in 1778.
