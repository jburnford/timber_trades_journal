The waney board pine logs fetched from 1s. 6d. to 2s. 7½d. per cubic foot, and whitewood 1s. 9d., and ash 1s. 7d. to 2s., but the average size of the timber was not large.
First yellow pine deals, long lengths, seemed a better inquiry, and prices for ends ranged from 2s. 4½d. to 2s. 7d. per cubic foot.
A few 1st quality pine 1 in. per cubic foot, and some canary whitewood flooring boards from 2½d. to 2¾d. per sq. foot.
Of Baltic deals and battens a fair proportion of the various descriptions was placed, although there was no large line of any particular kind.

SCOTTISH ABORICULTURAL SOCIETY.
Many matters of exceptional interest will be brought before the general meeting of the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society, to be held at 5, St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh, on the 6th inst.
A vice-president falls to be elected in room of the late Dr. Cleghorn, and for his vacancy the Council recommend a most worthy successor (Professor Somerville), and should their recommendation be adopted, Professor Somerville's place in the Council will require to be filled, and for this position the Council recommend Mr. James Kay, Forester, Bute.
It is proposed also to add Professor Schwappach, of Eberswalde, to the list of foreign honorary members.
In view of the many subjects which the past year has brought into prominence, the chairman's address will lack nothing, either in that graceful diction, useful guidance or suggestion, which is his wont.
Not less interesting will be the report of judges on the following essays, &c., sent in for competition:—
CLASS I
1. "On the Pine Saw Fly." By "Donnida."
2. "On the Best Method of Rearing Plantations with the view of obtaining Timber of a Clean Growth, Fine Quality, and High Commercial Value." By "Exogenous."
3. "On the Best Method of Rearing Plantations with the view of obtaining Timber of a Clean Growth, Fine Quality, and High Commercial Value." By "Red Deal."
4. "Some Notes on the Physiology of Timber Trees and Shrubs as shown by the Microscope." By "Liber."
CLASS II
1. "On the Best Size of Plants and Method of Planting to produce the Best Results, &c." By "Treeplanter."
2. "On Peeling and Harvesting of Different Kinds of British Bark used in tanning." By "Rob Roy."
A paper will be read by Mr. John Michie, Forester to Her Majesty the Queen, Balmoral, on "German Forestry in the Thuringer-Wald, Saxony."
It will add a stimulus to the eager expectancy of the pleasures in store for them, with which the excursion party for Germany will set off on the afternoon of the same day, and form also a fitting prelude to the discussion of plans for the society's excursion in 1896.
Some new features proposed to be added to the record of Transactions will also be discussed.
We are informed that a special prize of ten guineas will be presented by Professor Bayley Balfour for an approved report showing the financial results of the cultivation of woods and plantations.
With a bill of fare so varied and so practical, those present at this meeting will enjoy an intellectual feast.

BUILDING NEWS.
Engineers were busy last week at Helensburgh making a survey of the railway station, with a view, it is hoped, to the early commencement of its much-needed improvement and extension.
* * *
Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells, in their latest circular, report that the retail and building trades were fairly busy during June, but saw-millers and merchants did not purchase to any extent.
* * *
The death is announced of Mr. Robert Shillinglaw, one of the best known members of the building trade in Edinburgh, at Melrose.
Though a native of the Border district, he spent the greater part of his life in Edinburgh, and proved a successful man of business.
He was associated with many of the foremost building undertakings in his day, not in Edinburgh only, but in Scotland generally.
* * *
At the Partick Dean of Guild Court last week, before Bailies Crawford and Gardner, lining was granted to George Harvey, joiner, to erect sheds and workshops at Whiteinch.
An application was made by the Corporation, to put up erections in the stance of Oswald Street and George Street, Whiteinch, which is being reopened as a shipbuilding yard.
Lining was granted.
* * *
At the Edinburgh Dean of Guild Court 26 cases were disposed of, all of them unimportant in character.
Eleven warrants were granted.
The Incorporation of the Orphan Hospital, were granted a warrant to reconstruct the chapel and schoolroom at the Hospital, so as to form one large hall.
Mr. Richard Wallace, at the instance of the Procurator-Fiscal, was fined two guineas, with expenses, for building without a warrant in Windsor Street Lane.
The plea was that the building was temporary, and that he did not think it was necessary to apply for a warrant.
* * *
At the Perth Dean of Guild Court, Bailie Nicoll presiding, authority was granted to Archibald Todd, London, to erect an additional story to engineering works on the east side of King Street, and to erect a tenement of dwelling-houses on the site of half of the old works.
* * *
At the M'Nicol Institute, Greenock, plans to John M'Nicol for the erection of an addition to the east end of the present tenement.
