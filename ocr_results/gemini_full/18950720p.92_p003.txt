FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

ADAMS, ALFRED, builder, 27, Shaftesbury Road, Hornsey Rise, N.—The debtor filed his petition on June 27th, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Friday, before Mr. G. Wreford, Official Receiver. The accounts showed unsecured debts £1,172 15s 7d., the creditors including Messrs. Norton & Son, City Road Basin, £178 12s., and Messrs. Palfreman, Foster, & Co., New Boad Street, £124 10s. 1d. There were no assets. The debtor commenced business in May, 1893, with a capital of £100, and has erected houses in various parts of London. The operations resulted in a loss, to which fact the debtor attributes his failure. He adds that owing to an accident he has been unable to do any work since January last. Mr. Street attended on behalf of creditors, and nominated Mr. Edward Hobbs, accountant, Old Jewry, as trustee. He stated that his clients were not aware of the fact that the debtor was an undischarged bankrupt or they would not have given him credit. He had been interested in building operations with another bankrupt whose estate was also being administered by Mr. Hobbs, and it was necessary that the whole circumstances should be fully investigated. The nomination of Mr. Hobbs was supported by other creditors, and was carried, and a committee of inspection was also appointed, consisting of Mr. George Clark, Mr. H. G. Foster (Palfreman, Foster, & Co), and Mr. Brand. The debtor denied that he had obtained goods on credit recently, as he had done nothing since the accident in January last, and he asserted that he had acted honestly in every way. Mr. Street expressed his dissent, but said that he would reserve his examination until the public sitting on August 7th, when the debtor would be on his oath.

AVISS, ROBT. (trading as Robert Aviss & Co.), builder, saw-mill proprietor, and contractor, of Cedar Lodge, Putney Bridge Road, S.W., and trading at Baltic Wharf, Brewhouse Lane, Putney, S.W.—Mr. Alexander Mackintosh, Official Receiver for the Wandsworth district, on Monday issued particulars in this matter. The receiving order, dated June 21st, was made on the debtor's own petition. The gross liabilities are £24,348 17s. 3d, of which, however, only £1,245 9s. 1d. is due to unsecured creditors and expected to rank for dividend. The assets are:—Stock-in-trade, £900; machinery and engines, £1,000; fixtures, &c., £70; furniture, £100; building agreement, £200; good book debts, £140 13s.; surplus from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors, £9,542 10s. 2d.; total, £11,953 3s. 2d. There are preferential claims to the amount of £1,017 19s. 7d., leaving assets £10,935 3s. 7d., and showing a surplus of £9,689 14s. 6d. The debtor states, "I do not now and have never considered myself insolvent, but, on the contrary, I estimate my estate will show a large surplus (considerably over £8,000), but this principally depends upon the realisation of my mortgaged properties." The debtor has, through his solicitor, stated his intention of bringing forward a scheme of arrangement, which he expects to be able to lay before the creditors when they meet. The Official Receiver states:—The debtor, who describes himself as a builder, contractor, and proprietor of saw-mills, trading at Baltic Wharf, Brewhouse Lane, Putney, as Robert Aviss & Co., states that he commenced business forty years ago in partnership with his late father, Wm. Aviss, and that the business was taken over by him twenty-five years ago, at which time, he states, he had a capital of about £2,000. As already stated, the debtor considers himself solvent, and states that the filing of his creditors together and the consequent filing of his petition was brought about by the fact that a firm of solicitors declined to hand over to him two sums of £500 and £600, which amounts they are stated to have claimed to retain in part payment of an amount due to them and their clients under a mortgage deed. The debtor states that he kept a cash book containing a record of his business receipts and payments, ledgers, time books, wages books, invoice book, and journals, which were kept by his bookkeeper. He also states that the books were balanced once a year, and that a balance-sheet was made out last December. No statement of assets and liabilities, however, appears to have been made out other than the one prepared by the accountant and placed before the meeting of creditors on the 20th ult. At his preliminary examination, the debtor alleged that during the last three years his income has been £600 a year (£400 of which, he states, was the net profit of his business, and £200 the net rental of his property), and that his expenditure during that period has averaged £400 a year, £200 of which appears to have been drawn from the business, but, as will be observed, these figures do not agree with those given in the surplus account in the statement of affairs. The creditors scheduled as fully secured are stated to hold charges and mortgages on the various freehold and leasehold properties belonging to the debtor. In compliance with a request by a number of the creditors, I have appointed Mr. R. J Ward to act as special manager until the first meeting of creditors. The debtor considers that on January 1st last his assets exceeded his liabilities by £9,585 11s. 4d., and that he has made a profit from his business in that period of £179 3s. 2d., and has received rents of properties £225. His household expenses of himself and five children have been £300 since January 1st, 1894.

BURDETT, F. R. W., builder and contractor, Herne Bay, Kent.—This debtor made an application for his discharge at the Canterbury Bankruptcy Court, on Monday last, before his Honour Judge Selfe. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed liabilities estimated at £3,426 10s. 5d., and there were no assets. No dividend had been paid, and the Official Receiver stated that no dividend could be paid, as there was £40 owing for costs of winding up the estate. The debtor commenced business in 1872, in partnership with his father, in London. The application was opposed by Mr. Henry Bassent, a creditor. Eventually his Honour granted the discharge subject to the debtor consenting to judgment being entered against him for £200, to be paid by instalments of £50 per annum.

CLARKE, W. H., mineral water case manufacturer, 39, Lark Street, Farnworth, Lancs. The Official Receiver for the Bolton district has now issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the debtor who carried on business at the Jackson Street Boxworks, Farnworth, has filed a statement of his affairs showing unsecured liabilities amounting to £3,349 8s. 9d., to fully secured creditors £469 12s. 6d. The assets were estimated to produce £3,073 2s. 6d., thus leaving a deficiency of £275 19s. 9d. The debtor alleges his failure to have been caused through excess of expenditure over income, underestimating cost of production, loss on hired machinery, depreciation in value of stock and plant, and heavy interest on borrowed money. The report and observations of the Official Receiver are to the following effect. The debtor commenced business
