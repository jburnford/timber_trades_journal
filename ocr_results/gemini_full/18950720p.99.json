Examination, County Buildings, Glasgow, August 7, at 10. Agents, Carruthers & Gemmill, 62, Bath Street, Glasgow.\n\nHOSPITAL AT EDINBURGH.\n\nLord Provost M'Donald and a number of the members of the Edinburgh Town Council have paid a visit to Craiglockhart, and have met with the chairman and other representatives of the new Parish Council, with reference to the proposal that the Council should there acquire a site for a Corporation Hospital. After going over and examining the ground, the Town Council representatives selected a site, consisting partly of level ground and partly of hill ground, which they considered most suitable for the purpose. The ground in question consists of the westernmost field on the north side of the approach joining to the east, together with the southern slope of East Craiglockhart Hill, immediately to the north of the two fields just mentioned. The site extends in all to about 19 acres. This piece of ground answers most of the requirements sought for in a site for the purpose in view. It is understood that the Lord Provost will bring the matter before the Town Council at its next meeting, with the view of the Council considering whether an offer should be made at once to the Parish Council for the acquisition of the ground by arbitration. The buildings at present occupied at the Poorhouse at Craiglockhart were also under consideration, but it is understood that there are serious difficulties in the way of adapting them to the purposes of a hospital according to first-rate modern requirements.\n\nWORK IN GOVAN.\n\nThere is a good deal of work in Govan shipyards to keep the men fully employed during the autumn and winter months, to be started when the holidays are over. There has been a manifest improvement in trade during the last few months, which shows signs of being maintained. Messrs. Alexander Stephen & Sons, Linthouse, have two vessels on the stocks and two keels laid, besides two more to lay down. The Fairfield Company is well stocked with orders. The two gunboats are in a forward condition, but there is a lot of work to be done on them yet. Besides that there is a torpedo-boat destroyer still on the stocks, and there are two Scottish and Oriental boats, a Donald Currie boat, and other smaller vessels to be laid down, besides a quantity of new and repair work in the dock. Messrs. Mackie & Thomson have a steam missionary boat and a few trawlers on hand, which will keep the firm occupied for some little time, while the London and Glasgow Company have a plethora of work, all the stocks being full and other keels waiting to be laid. Robert Napier & Sons (Limited) have the keel laid to replace the vessel that foundered on her first voyage, besides two small orders to lay down. The engineering works are also busy, most of them working a night shift, while the other factories and works show a marked improvement over last year.\n\nTHE NEW MUIRKIRK RAILWAY.—A special meeting of Ayrshire County Council has been held, Hon. G. R. Vernon, vice convener, Mauchline, presiding. The solicitors of the Muirkirk, Bill submitted a communication Railways certain deviations proposed to be made.

The accounts for the past year, as audited by Mr. Alexander Tosh, C.A., Dundee, were submitted to the meeting. The accounts were approved of in terms of the Act.\n\nAt the usual fortnightly meeting of the Glasgow Dean of Guild Court, held on the 11th inst., the following applications for new buildings were granted:— Paul & M'Neil, builders, 301, Victoria Road, to erect three tenements of dwelling-houses and shops at Rutherglen Road; John Manson & Sons, joiners, Crossmyloof, to erect a tenement of shops and dwelling-houses of two and three rooms and kitchen on the south-east side of Kilmarnock Road; A. Stewart & Co., builders, Maxwell Road, to erect eight tenements of shops and dwelling-houses in a new street of Garngad Hill.\n\nAt Leith Dean of Guild Court on 15th inst. considerable discussion took place as to buildings being erected with hollow walls. In the first case, an application by the Ropene Company for two-story buildings, the warrant was granted by a majority. The second application was by Mr. J. Shaw for tenements of dwelling-houses at Newhaven Road. The Provost and Bailie Manclark objected to hollow walls, and Bailie Archibald approved of the plans, saying they were better for ventilation. The applicant pointed out that the burgh fever hospital was being erected with hollow walls. The warrant was refused by four votes to three.\n\nFollowing up the improvements on the estate of Careston, the proprietor, Mr. W. Shaw Adamson, has spared no expense to make it a model estate.
