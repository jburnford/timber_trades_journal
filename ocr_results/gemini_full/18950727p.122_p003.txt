FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
AVISS, ROBERT, trading as Robert Aviss & Co., builders and contractors, Cedar Lodge, Putney Bridge Road, and the Baltic Wharf, Brewhouse Lane, Putney.—The first meeting of the creditors interested under this failure took place at the offices of the Official Receiver, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E., on Tuesday, under the presidency of Mr. Mackintosh, Senior Official Receiver for the Wandsworth district. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed gross liabilities amounting to £24,348 17s. 3d., of which £1,245 9s. 1d. was due to unsecured creditors ; to fully-secured creditors, £21,982 9s. 10d., the value of the securities being returned at £31,525, thus leaving a surplus of £9,542 10s. 2d., to rank as an asset ; to liabilities on bills, £102 18s. 9d., these, however, are not expected to rank against the estate for dividend ; to preferential creditors claims deducted per contra, £1,017 19s. 7d. The assets, consisting of stock-in-trade, valued at £900, machinery and engines, valued at £1,000, trade fixtures, fittings, furniture, &c., are estimated at £2,270, in addition to which there are book debts, good, valued at £140 13s., and the estimated surplus from securities in the hands of fully-secured creditors valued at £9,542 10s. 2d. Total assets £11,953 3s. 2d., from which £1,017 19s. 7d. had to be deducted for the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaving net assets at £10,935 3s. 7d. Mr. Ward, in reply to the Official Receiver, stated that since he had acted as special manager, the estate had been worked at a profit of £6. The landlord had put in a claim for 3½ years' rent, amounting to £600, but rather than have the expense of a distraint he would pay the rent himself ; in fact, he had already become surety for the rent to the landlord. As far as the estate was concerned, it had not depreciated since the date of the receiving order. The debtor's solicitor, in reply to the chairman, said he was sorry he had not been able to complete the scheme of arrangement, but the lines proposed by the debtor would be to pay 20s. in the pound. All the debtor's property was mortgaged with the exception of one block, over which the bank held a charge, and what he proposed to do was to effect a mortgage on the property, pay off the bank, and divide the surplus remaining at once among the creditors. He estimated that the property in question would realise more than £1,000.

DOWN, HENRY, joiner and builder, 29, Dixon Street, Warrington.—The Official Receiver for the Warrington district has now issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the unsecured liabilities amount to £682 14s. 7d., and the assets are estimated to produce £68 3s. 4d. The debtor, in explanation of his failure, says he has been put to considerable expense through ill-health, and he has lost money on contracts. The report and observations of the Official Receiver are to the following effect. The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition, and at the date of the order there were three unsatisfied judgments against him. The debtor states that he has been in business since 1888, and that he commenced without any capital. He attributes £223 6s. 6d. of his deficiency to an anticipated profit in the realisation of his assets. With regard to the balance, he says he cannot explain it, through his omission to keep proper books of account. He further states that his household expenses have been heavy, owing to illness. The bankrupt alleges that he has not kept any book beyond a day book, and that he has never prepared any balance-sheet or statement of affairs at any time during his trading career. The debtor also states that he first became aware of his insolvency about the end of 1893, and that

over and above the charge held by the bank. By this means they would be able to pay all costs and charges in connection with the bankruptcy in cash, and they would also be able to pay the unsecured creditors a composition of 15s. in the pound within fourteen days of the sanction of the scheme by the Court. The remaining 15s. in the pound would be paid by three equal instalments, viz., 5s. in within six months of the date of the sanction of the scheme by the Court, 5s. within nine months, and 5s. within twelve months. The debtor would assign his property to a trustee to be appointed by the creditors, and would empower him to deal with the assets in any way that he might think proper. The Official Receiver remarked that the creditors would have to decide whether the proposed scheme would be more beneficial to them than bankruptcy. The liabilities were returned at £1,200, and the assets according to the debtor's own valuation were worth £2,300, irrespective of the value of the securities in the hands of fully secured creditors. Personally, he had not the smallest objection to the scheme, but even if the creditors passed it the debtor's solicitor would have to prove to the Court that it was more beneficial to the unsecured creditors than bankruptcy. A long discussion then ensued, in the course of which several creditors expressed an opinion that the scheme suggested would prove preferable to bankruptcy; however, it was pointed out by the Official Receiver that under the circumstances nothing could be done that day, as the meeting would have to be adjourned until the scheme of composition had been filed by the debtor. Eventually the following resolutions were passed, "That Mr. R. J. Ward continue to act as special manager until August 20th next." "That the meeting stand adjourned for one month." The meeting was then concluded.
BINSTEAD, HENRY JOHN, builder, Runcton, near Chichester.—The receiving order herein was made on the 14th June, 1895, and the debtor has now filed a statement of affairs which shows gross liabilities £2,414 1s. 7d., of which is due to unsecured creditors £1,463 10s. The assets are £712 10s. 8d., less preferential claims £5 9s., leaving net assets £707 1s. 8d. Deficiency £756 8s. 4d. The debtor alleges as the cause of his failure "losses on contracts." The Official Receiver's observations are: — The receiving order was made on debtor's own petition on the 14th day of June last. He states that he formerly worked for his father, who carried on business as a builder at Bognor. The debtor states that in 1883 he commenced business on his own account in the same village, but only in a small way, that on the death of his father he took over his business and has since been engaged in various contracts and general work of a speculative character, and the debtor states that the contracts have mostly resulted in a loss. The debtor has given charges on the freehold dwelling-house and workshops at Runcton, and also on a plot of land at the same place. He has also assigned to his bankers an amount due under a contract. The debtor is of opinion that after these various charges have been satisfied there will not be any surplus for the benefit of the estate. I understand that debtor intends to bring forward a proposal for a composition, but no proposition has been lodged with me as yet.
FARR, THOS., builder and contractor, Truro Street, Truro.—This bankruptcy came up for public examination at the West Bromwich Bankruptcy Court on Friday last week, before the Official Receiver. The liabilities were returned at £532, of which £237 will rank for dividend. In the course of his examination he said he began business in August 1893, with a capital, and he had started contracting. His failure was due to speculation in trade, and losses in bankruptcy. The debtor expressed the opinion that there would be a surplus of £60 from the securities held "under the mark," and that there ought to be not less than 10s. in the pound. There was no opposition.
FRANKS, W. M., builder, 19, Buxton Road, Highbury, N.—This bankrupt came up in November, 1890, and the case was adjourned last week to Mr. Registrar Linklater for his discharge. The liabilities were returned at £69 17s., assets nil. It appeared that he commenced business in 1882 without any capital, and by means of a series of speculative building operations in various parts of London, being also occasionally employed as a foreman and carpenter. The offences of keeping and rash and hazardous speculations were charged as offences by the Official Receiver. His Honour, taking into consideration the time that had elapsed since the failure, suspended the discharge, subject to a nominal suspension of three weeks.
GREGORY, RICHARD, builder and box manufacturer, trading at 184, Neath Road, Landore.—This bankrupt came up for his public examination at the Swansea Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar Horne, on Thursday. A previous statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed a deficiency of £777 18s. 8d. In reply to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that his failure was through bad debts and depreciation of property. He admitted that two days of filing his petition he had received about £100 worth of timber which he had ordered about six weeks before, when he was aware of his insolvency. He became aware of his insolvency about six weeks before the end of 1894. He admitted that it was unfair to the creditor to take in timber with a knowledge of his insolvent position, and he also admitted that it would have been better if he had informed the creditor in question that he was in a state of insolvency at the time. The debtor was finally allowed to pass.
GULLETT, FRED., and FRANK BAKER, builders, of Wealdstone, Harrow.—The first meeting of the creditors interested in this failure took place at the offices of the Official Receiver for the Harrow district, Temple Chambers, London, E.C., on Wednesday, under the presidency of Mr. H. W. Waimsley, Deputy Official Receiver. The statement of affairs showed
