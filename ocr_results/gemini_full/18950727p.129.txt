DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP.
KINNEAR & RODIE, & Co. (David Kinnear and John Rodie), builders and contractors, Edinburgh and Glasgow. October 19, 1833, by death of David Kinnear. John Robertson has been winding up and carrying on the business under the same firm name.

SHIPBUILDING.
William Hamilton & Co., Port Glasgow, have contracted to build a steamer of about 400 tons dead weight. This is in addition to the contract reported about ten days ago. The hull and machinery are to be built to the requirements, and to take the highest class, of the British Corporation for the Survey and Registry of Shipping.

The shipbuilders who are in the habit of doing Government work are anxiously awaiting the issue of tenders for the construction of the remainder of the 30-knot torpedo-boat destroyers authorised to be built by the late Administration. Last year twenty of these vessels were placed with private firms, and of this number three have been launched and handed over to the Admiralty by Messrs. J. & G. Thompson, Clydebank. Of the remainder, the "Handy" and "Hunter" are nearing completion at the Fairfield establishment. Much interest is being centred in the "Fervent" and "Zephyr," built by Messrs. Hanna, Donald & Wilson, Paisley, as these two vessels carry locomotive boilers, instead of the water-tube steam generators fitted to the rest of the numerous class.

An order has been placed with the Blyth Shipbuilding Company, Limited, for a steamer of about 5,000 tons burden. At present work in the shipbuilding and repairing yards generally at Blyth is slack, and, as a consequence, large numbers of workmen have been thrown out of employment.

The Admiralty have contracted with Messrs. J. & G. Thompson, of Glasgow, to supply and fit the machinery of the new second-class cruiser "Pelorus," which has just been laid down on the building slip at Sheerness Dockyard. The engines of the "Pelorus"—which is the first of the new class of third-class cruisers—are estimated to develop 7,000 horse-power under natural draught, giving her a speed of 20 knots. If expectations are realised in this respect, the "Pelorus" will be the fastest third-class cruiser ever built for the Royal Navy. She will have a length of 300 ft., a breadth of 36 ft. 6 in., and a displacement of 2,135 tons. The armament of the "Pelorus" is to consist of eight 25-pounder quick-firing guns and eight 3-pounder Hotchkiss quick-firing guns.

BUILDING NEWS.
A special sitting of the Paisley Dean of Guild Court was held, Bailie Robertson and Bailie Macfarlane presiding, when Mrs. M'Colgan was given authority to take down the property at the corner of Causeyside Street and Incle Street, and to erect a new tenement in its stead.
* * *
At a meeting of the Works Committee of the Dundee Town Council the formation of eight new streets on the estate belonging to Mr. Thoms, of Wester Clepington, was sanctioned. The thoroughfares will each have a carriageway of 33 feet in width and a footway of 8 1/2 feet wide.
* * *
The operative joiners of Falkirk and district struck work in resistance to a proposal by the employers to reduce the rate of wages from 8d. to 7 1/2d. per hour. About 140 men are idle. Building is very brisk in the town and neighbourhood, and the cessation of work will keep back the erection of buildings which were being hurried on towards completion.
* * *
The Pollokshaws Dean of Guild Court has held its ordinary sitting. Messrs. Nicol and Emery on the bench. After considerable discussion William R. Aitken, builder, Shawlands, was empowered to proceed with the erection of two tenements of dwelling-houses at Coustonhill. Patrick M'Kenna, iron merchant, was granted lining to convert his property in King Street into dwelling-houses.
* * *
Kinghorn Parish Church was opened on Sunday after entire reconstruction. The galleries have been removed, and a new roof has been put on. The building occupies the site of a pre-Reformation Church, and the old chancel arch has been opened up and a new apse built behind it. A new west gable, tower, and entrance door have been added, and the church is now a handsome and commodious edifice. The architects are Messrs. Sydney Mitchell & Wilson, Edinburgh.
