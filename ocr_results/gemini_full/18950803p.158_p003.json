Upon the application of Messrs. Godfrey & Robertson, a receiving order was made under a petition presented by Mr. A. J. Harland, of Wenlock Road, the act of bankruptcy alleged being the non-compliance of the debtor with the requirements of the usual statutory notice. No particulars transpired.\nBELSHAW, WILLIAM, joiner and builder, Spring Road, Peel Causeway, Altrincham.—The first meeting of the creditors concerned under the above failure was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Manchester, on Friday last. The Official Receiver, who presided, stated that no statement of affairs he had been informed that the debtor had left the country and gone to America. After some discussion it was resolved to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver for administration in the usual manner.\nGILL, FRANCIS, builder, 24, Upper East Smithfield, Whitechapel Road, and Catford.—The bankrupt, who failed in December, 1893, applied last week to Mr. Registrar Hope for an order of discharge. Having heard Mr. Gibson in support of the application, the Registrar upheld the Official Receiver's report,",
