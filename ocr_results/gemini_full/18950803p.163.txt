M'GEACHIN, W., sole partner of the firm of W. & J. M'Geachin, cabinet-makers and furniture warehousemen, 42, Great Clyde Street, Glasgow.—The examination in bankruptcy of this debtor was fixed for Wednesday, the 31st ult., in the Chambers of Sheriff Erskine Murray. There were present Mr. J. L. Hodge, C.A., trustee, and Mr. Poole Watson, law agent in the sequestration. Bankrupt failed to appear, having, it was stated, gone to America, and a warrant was granted for his apprehension. George W M'Geachin, father of the bankrupt, said that he retired from the business in Great Clyde Street six years ago, and sold it to his two sons for between £800 and £900. This was paid in bills, of which he had received instalments which left £345 still unpaid. He advanced his sons other sums of money, with the result that the bankrupt was due to him about £1,000. Last year his two sons were sequestrated, and an arrangement for payment of a composition was made under which he became security. When the bankrupt disappeared there was an instalment due, and it was only partly provided for. According to the statement of affairs the liabilities amounted to £1,451 8s. 8d., and the assets to £597 8s. 7d.—a deficiency of £854 0s. 1d.

PINKERTON, WILLIAM, cabinetmaker, 8, Greenside Row, Edinburgh.—In the Edinburgh Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday the debtor appeared for examination in bankruptcy. In reply to questions by Mr. Marcus J. Brown, S.S.C., who was present for creditors, the bankrupt said he carried on business as cabinetmaker at 42, Milton Street, Edinburgh, under the name of Pinkerton & Wright, cabinetmakers. He had been in partnership with Catherine Wright for about two months, but he had had dealings with her for about three years. She advanced £15 for goods which she had received from him. Out of that sum she bought wood, and during the months of June and July he had done very good business. He had had five or six men working. He was paid about £7 weekly for wages, and his drawings amounted to about £12. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £445 2s. 6d., and assets £70 14s. 9d. The Sheriff granted sequestration.

DUNDEE.—A meeting of the Works Committee of Dundee Town Council has been held, when a report was submitted from the clerk regarding the openings in the Esplanade wall. He was of opinion that the finished work of the wall or bulwark could not be materially altered without the previous sanction of the Board of Trade or Harbour Trustees. It might also be expedient to get the railway companies to act along with the Council in the matter. The building up of the openings in question, in his opinion, would be a material alteration in the existing work. The committee made no recommendation, as they saw no reason to interfere in the matter.

SIR WILLIAM ARROL, the builder of the Forth Bridge, has found a place in the new House of Commons. He is a self-made man in the fullest sense of the term. He began work in a cotton mill when he was only eight years old; but he was afterwards apprenticed as a blacksmith. It was at the works of Messrs. Laidlaw & Sons that he acquired his first practical experience of bridge building. He is now, at the age of fifty-six, the principal partner in the firm of William Arrol & Co. In addition to the Forth Bridge, the construction of which occupied five years, the firm rebuilt the Tay Bridge, and carried out the ironwork in connection with the recently finished Tower Bridge.
