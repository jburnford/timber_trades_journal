FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ADAMS, A. J., builder, 27, Shaftesbury Road, Hornsey Rise, N.-A sitting for the bankrupt's public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Linklater, the accounts showing unsecured debts £1,172 15s. 7d. and assets nil. Mr. E. S. Grey appeared as assistant receiver, and Mr. Street for the trustee. The bankrupt in the course of his examination stated that for some years prior to 1888 he had been engaged in speculative building operations. In November of that year he was made bankrupt, and had not yet obtained his discharge. In January, 1890, he started as a plumber and zinc worker, and traded as such until May, 1893, when, having a capital of about £100, he again engaged in building operations. He lost £100 on a contract in Whitecross Street owing to a dispute respecting ancient lights. In November, 1893, he took a contract for rebuilding houses at Clerkenwell Green, and while the work was in progress an adjoining building collapsed. An action for the recovery of damages was brought against him and the freeholder, and it was compromised for £500, the net result being that he lost £750 on the contract. In May, 1894, he took a building agreement for 73 houses at Stoke Newington, but

before completion, when the mortgagees foreclosed, and the bulk of his present liabilities were for materials supplied in those houses. Examiner: You were, in fact, an undischarged bankrupt, the whole time?-The bankrupt said he was. He had not informed any of his present creditors that he was an undischarged bankrupt, the bankruptcy proceedings were principally carried on but he was always pleased to give any information he could. He had informed Messrs. Morton & Son's traveller of his previous failure, and several other persons. The bankrupt was also examined respecting his transactions with a Mr. Sugg, whose affairs were recently before the Court, and in the result the examination was ordered to be concluded.

AKERROYD, ZACCHEUS, builder, 18, Marshfield Terrace, Manchester Road, Bradford, carrying on business under the style of Zaccheus Akeroyd & Co.-The Official Receiver for the Bradford district has now issued particulars from which it appears that the debtor has filed a statement of affairs showing gross liabilities amounting to £4,532 8s., of which £580 1s. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend. The assets consist principally of an estimated surplus from the securities in the hand of fully secured creditors, and are estimated at £336 13s. 4d., from which £20 15s. 6d. has to be deducted for the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaving nett assets at £315 17s. 10d., thus showing an estimated deficiency of £264 3s. 2d. The debtor alleges his failure to have been caused through depreciation in the value of his real property. He has no books of account, except a time book and rent book. The debtor has intimated that he does not intend to offer any composition to his creditors.

AUSTIN, JAMES, timber merchant, 421 to 431, Barking Road, E.-Upon the application of Messrs. Ward, Perks, and McKay, a receiving order was made in this case, on Monday, under a creditor's petition.

BOOTH, WILLIAM S., timber merchant, Hoxton Street, Hoxton, and Packing Case Maker, who also traded as a grocer at 165, St. John's Road, Hoxton, N., trading as the London Box Company.-The bankrupt, who failed in May last, and applied on Wednesday to Mr. Registrar Linklater for his discharge. The unsecured liabilities were returned at £5,055 1s. 7d., and the assets at £2,130 17s. 3d., but it was not expected that they would realise more than £2,350 at the utmost. It appeared that the bankrupt commenced business as a tea dealer about 35 years ago, and between 1881 and 1883 he was possessed of a large amount of capital. About that time he built and fitted up premises on land at the rear of his shop at Hoxton for the purpose of a saw-mill, at a total expense of about £7,000, which amount he withdrew from the capital in the tea and grocery business, and he attributed his failure mainly to losses incurred in respect of the saw-mill. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had traded after knowing himself to be insolvent; also, in connection with the saw-mill undertaking, that he had brought on or contributed to his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation. Mr. Carrington said that he appeared for the bankrupt, and contested the Official Receiver's report. Notice to dispute had, however, not been given, and the hearing was accordingly adjourned over the Long Vacation.
