EDINBURGH AND LEITH MASTER BUILDERS' ASSOCIATION.—At a meeting of this Association it has been unanimously agreed not to entertain the demand for an increase of joiners' wages, it being considered that the state of trade did not warrant it.

THE PROPOSED EDINBURGH HOSPITAL IN LEITH.
At Leith Dean of Guild Court, before Bailies Manclark, S.S.C., and Robertson, Mr. Asher, S.S.C., applied on behalf of Edinburgh Town Council for a warrant to erect a hospital at Quarryholes. The appellants, as Governors of Trinity Hospital, are proprietors of the ground. The Master of Works reported that the hospital would be constructed of wood, and would consist of three pavilions, one story in height. The Master of Works had no objection to the petition. He understood the hospital was of a temporary nature. Mr. Welsh, S.S.C., on behalf of the proprietor of the Drum estate, opposed the application, and asked to be cited as a respondent. The lands of Drum were, he said, immediately adjoining the site of the proposed hospital, and there was at present an action in the Court of Session between the parties as to the boundaries. The hospital was proposed to be put down on this disputed ground. Mr. Asher and Mr. Morham, city architect, denied that that was the case, and that if the petition was hung up till the action was decided, it might be for years. It would be a dangerous thing to allow such a defence. Bailie Archibald said if Mr. Welsh succeeded in his action he could make them take down the hospital. Mr. Welsh said he might be held to have foreclosed. Bailie Archibald said he did not see that, because a question of exchange had been raised, the petitioners were not to have the use of their own land till the action was settled. Bailie Manclark said if they were so anxious for amalgamation, why were they coming down to Leith with their hospital? Could they not get a better place than that? Mr. Asher said he had no information as to that. Mr. Welsh then presented a minute asking to be allowed to lodge answers, and Mr. Asher pressed for a warrant. Bailie Manclark said he was in favour of allowing the minute and putting back the case for a fortnight. Bailie Archibald said that in his opinion because there was a case in the Court of Session was not a good reason for delay. He was against the delay. Mr. Robertson favoured delay to allow Mr. Welsh to put in answers, and this accordingly became the finding of the Court.

MESSRS. EDMINSTON & MITCHELLS, in their new circular, report the arrivals into the Clyde from British North America during July of 26 vessels, comprising 15 from Quebec and 11 from Lower Ports. Nine of the arrivals from Quebec were part cargoes by steamers.

TRADE IN PAISLEY.—Reports as to the state of trade received by Paisley Trades Council on Tuesday night speak of an improvement in most of the iron industries as compared with the previous month, blacksmiths, boilermakers, and patternmakers being fairly well employed, moulders busy, and engineering moderately so. The building trades (including masons, bricklayers, and joiners) also reported good business; plumbers fairly well employed; wood-turners, and mill-workers busy.
