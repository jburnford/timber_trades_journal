The Official Receiver asked the Court to make an order on the bankrupt for a statement showing what sums he had received from his wife in respect of properties built by him, and which were now claimed by his wife. The Registrar granted the application, and the examination was adjourned accordingly.\n\nHOPKINS, JOHN WEBB, builder, 4, 7s. Frederick Road, Aston, formerly 4, Hunters Row, Birmingham.—The statutory meeting of the creditors concerned hereunder took place at the offices of the Official Receiver, Birmingham, on Tuesday, under the presidency of the Assistant Official Receiver. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt disclosed liabilities amounting to £553 11s. 3d., and the assets were estimated to produce £17. The Official Receiver in his report and observations stated that the debtor in 1870 commenced business as a builder and contractor at Ledsam Street, Ladywood. In 1873, owing to losses on contracts, he assigned his estate to a trustee, his liabilities at the time amounting to £400. In 1880 he commenced business as a speculative builder with a capital of £40. In 1891 the mortgagees of the different properties took possession, and since then the debtor has been engaged as a builder's manager. The petition was filed in consequence of two creditors taking proceedings to recover the value of goods supplied to the bankrupt when he was engaged on a contract at Hampton Road and Acock's Green, Birmingham. The debtor alleges his present position to have been caused through \"losses in business as a speculative builder.\" Eventually it was resolved to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.\n\nHOPPER, C. C., builder, Talbot Court, Eastcheap, E.C.—Under this failure accounts have been recently filed showing liabilities £1,088 17s. 10d, of which £916 10s. 9d. is unsecured, and assets £108 7s. 1d. It appears from the bankrupt's statements that in Oct., 1882, he and his brother were taken into partnership by their then employer, they paying him £300 as premium, and also bringing in £300 as capital, and with whom they traded at 9, Talbot Court, Eastcheap, as \"Jones & Hopper Bros.,\" until December 31st, 1885, when the first-named retired (being eventually paid £600 and interest by instalments), and they took over and continued the business under the same style until January, 1894, when, at the bankrupt's instance, his brother resigned, the business being subsequently continued by the bankrupt alone as \"Jones & Hopper,\" down to the date of the receiving order.\n\nHUGHES, A., box and packing case manufacturer, 33, Great Arthur Street, E.C.—The first meeting of creditors was held in this case on Friday, before Mr. Howell, Assistant Receiver. The accounts showed debts £210 11s., and assets £101 18s. 1d. The debtor, who commenced business as above so recently as February last, attributed his insolvency to inexperience, robbery by an employe, want of capital, trade competition, and expenses exceeding profits. The matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver to be wound up in bankruptcy.\n\nHUGHES, DANIEL (trading without a partner as D. Hughes & Co.), timber merchant, 227a, Derby Road, Bootle, Lancs.—The following are creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nAshwell, Wm., Burnley ... ... 14 12 0\nAshbert & Co., Leicester ... ... 73 18 0\nBell, Wm., Bootle ... ... ... 15 14 0\nBiggs, G.

P., timber merchant, Widnes.—The public examination of this debtor was held at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Cooper, on Thursday. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt disclosed unsecured liabilities amounting to £3,000 7d.; to fully secured creditors, £2,000 12s. 2d.; to contingent liabilities, £74 2s. 6d.; assets consisted of a book debt of £1,000 6s. 6d., and an estimated surplus of £3,449 12s. in the hands of fully secured creditors. Replying to questions put by the assistant Official Receiver the debtor said he was a son of the late William Kershaw, saw-mill proprietor and timber merchant, of Widnes. In 1891 he became insane, and in October, 1892, he took out letters of administration. He carried on the business until February, 1894, and then gave it up, as he found it was not paying. He was a large holder of land and buildings in the Widnes district, and he valued his estate at £40,000, subject to mortgages to the extent of £40,000. Witness believed that the properties were worth the amount he estimated them to produce, but if they were realised at once he did not think there would be any profit. His wife had private means, and she was at present supporting him. The examination was eventually ordered to be adjourned.\n\nLAMB, WILLIAM, builder, North Road, Chester-le-Street, and formerly of North Warwick and Bensham.—An application was made at the Durham County Court on Tuesday, for the discharge of the above-mentioned debtor. The Official Receiver, in his report, stated that the debtor's assets did not equal 10s. in the pound on the unsecured liabilities, and that the debtor had omitted to keep proper books of account, and that he had traded with a knowledge of his insolvency. The Official Receiver further alleged that the debtor had failed to satisfactorily account for his deficiency, and that he had contributed to his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation. His Honour suspended the discharge for two years.\n\nLAYBERRY, WILLIAM, builder and contractor, Derby Road, Burton-on-Trent.—The first meeting of the creditors interested under this failure took place at the offices of the Official Receiver on Tuesday. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt disclosed liabilities amounting to £1,323 17s. 1d., and the assets consisted of stock-in-trade, furniture, book debts, &c., estimated to produce £681. After a long discussion it was resolved to appoint Mr. W. Bennett, accountant, Station Street, Burton-on-Trent, trustee, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection.\n\nOWEN, EDWARD, builder, 222, Harrow Road, London, late Aberdare Junction.—The following are among the creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nCardiff Steam Joinery Co., Cardiff ... 25 10 0\nDavies, Charles, Aberdare ... ... 40 0 0\nRobinson, David, & Co., Cardiff ... 53 1 0\nSouth Wales Cement Co., Penarth ... [?]\n\nPOVEY, ROBERT, builder, Smethwick.—This debtor, carrying on business as a builder at Oldbury Road, West Smethwick, came up at the West Bromwich County Court, on the 9th, for his public examination before Mr. Registrar Watson. The statement of affairs showed liabilities £1,088 6s. 11d., and assets £539 1s. 6d., leaving a deficiency of £559 5s. 5d. The bankruptcy was allowed to close on condition that the bankrupt should pay £1 per week.\n\nTROLLEY, JOHN, builder, of Avondale House, Fish Docks.—Mr. Official Receiver stated that the bankrupt commenced business as a builder in 1878, with his own capital, which he believed was a black mare, which he started his ship with. Some years ago he started a partnership with his brother. Formerly he was in partnership with his brother, but in 1878 they dissolved. He then went into bankruptcy, in that court, and paid a dividend of 8s. 6½d. in the £, on a deficiency of £229 14s. 7d. He had since been working for his brother at wages of 30s. per week, but he had been discharged. He attributed his present position to depression of trade, and said he was insolvent a month ago. Adjourned for a month.\n\nAUSTRIAN WAINSCOT OAK.\nJ. H. ROWNTREE, 30, Great St. Helens, LONDON, E.C.\nTELEGRAMS—\"GRACENOTE, LONDON.\"",
