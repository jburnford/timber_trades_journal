BUILDING NEWS.
Last week the Perth builders had their annual summer outing. The trip this year consisted of a drive to Crieff via Methven and back by Muthill and Auchterarder.

The plans, elevations, and sections of the new Dundee Post-office in Ward Road, were exhibited to the Works Committee of Dundee Town Council, and received general approval. The usual permission was granted to put in a continuous sunk area grating subject to the customary obligation.

Offers have been received for the erection of the Adam Smith and Beveridge Memorial Halls and Library at Kirkcaldy, which indicate that the plans of Messrs. Dunn & Fairlay, Edinburgh, can be carried out for a sum of between £11,000 and £12,000. Local tradesmen are the lowest offerers in the principal part of the work. These offers, however, have yet to be approved of.

At the last meeting of the Anstruther-Wester (Fife) Town Council, on the motion of Provost Porter, it was resolved to have an interview with the proprietors between High Cross and the harbour, with the view of trying to arrive at an amicable settlement as to the new drainage scheme ; and, failing this, to employ an engineer to state whether the existing drains between Watson Place and the harbour were sufficient to do the work at present, and to take in a new drain from High Cross to Watson Place.
