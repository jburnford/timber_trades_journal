Arthur Binns), the debtor said that for the past eight years he had gone somewhat extensively into speculative building. Before that time he was a builder in a small way of business. When he began speculative building he was supplied with money by his wife and brother-in-law. Before his failure he had thirty houses empty for eight or nine months, representing something like £12 a week in rent. He believed they were now let. He believed that twelve months ago he was worth £1,500. The value of his property had been depreciated by over £1,000. During the last twelve months there had been an loss of rent amounting to £100, and and auctioneers' charges had cost him about £250. He once filed his petition before—about eighteen years since. His wife had a separate estate which produced an income of about £25 a week. In reply to Mr. J. T. Last, who appeared on his behalf, the debtor said that during the last five years the cost of mortgaging and conveyancing must have been about a couple of thousand pounds. The examination was closed.\nAVISS, ROBERT, trading as Robert Aviss & Co., builder and contractor, Cedar Lodge, Putney Bridge Road, and trading at Brewhouse Lane, Putney, S.W.—The adjourned meeting of the creditors under this failure was held at the offices of the Official Receiver on Tuesday last. The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £24,348 17s 3d., of which £1,245 9s. 1d. was due to unsecured creditors. The assets were estimated to produce £11,953. It appeared that the meeting had been adjourned for a month to enable the debtor to bring forward a scheme of arrangement, but as the debtor had been unable to realise certain properties he asked for a further adjournment, and, after con-\nGANDY'S Celebrated Belting\nThe OLDEST.
