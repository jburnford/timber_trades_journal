McEwen & Sons\n\nBUILDING NEWS.\nAt a Dean of Guild Court held at Perth, Bailie Alexander presiding, warrant was granted to the Deacons' Court of the Free West Church to erect a hall, vestry, Session-room, men's room, kitchen, &c., in connection with the church; and to Messrs. Muir, Son, & Patton to erect stables on the east side of Elibank Street.\n* * *\nExtensive alterations are being made in Linlithgow West U.P. Church, including re-seating. A large hall is also being erected on an adjacent site for meetings and in connection with the church. While the alterations and extensions are being carried out the congregation are to worship in the County Buildings, the use of which has been granted by the County Council.\n* * *\nA meeting of the School Board of the Parish of Dundonald was held on 20th inst. at Troon. The Chairman reported that the Building Committee of Dundonald School had met on Friday, when, after examining the plans and reconsidering the whole question of the proposed class-rooms, it was recommend that two of the proposed class-rooms be excised altogether from the plans. This would reduce the accommodation from 420 to 340, or, if the gallery in entrance-hall were included, as sanctioned by the Education Department, the accommodation of the new school would be 300. It was unanimously agreed to cut down the plans as proposed, and to send them back to the Education Department for approval. Meanwhile it was resolved that the building should proceed. It is estimated that the saving effected by the proposed reduction in the size of the school will amount to between £400 and £500. The foundation-stone is to be laid by Lady Sophia Montgomerie on or about the 21st September.\n* * *\nAt Edinburgh Dean of Guild Court there have just been 40 applications; 16 warrants were granted. These included the following:—David Adams, four semi-detached villas, corner of Braid Avenue and Cluny Gardens; James Alexander, double villa, 11, to take down old buildings in Lady Stair's Close, and at 57, 59, and 61, Candlemaker Row, and 19, Cowgate; City, alterations at 1, Advocate's Close; Robert Dundas and others, New Club trustees, alterations at 85, Princes Street; Robert Handyside, two four-story tenements in a new street at Gorgie Road; Thomas Hunter, villa at Inverleith Place;",
