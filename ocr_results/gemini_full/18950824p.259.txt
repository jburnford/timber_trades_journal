BUILDING NEWS.
At a Dean of Guild Court held at Perth, Bailie Alexander presiding, warrant was granted to the Deacons' Court of the Free West Church to erect a hall, vestry, Session-room, men's room, kitchen, &c., in connection with the church; and to Messrs. Muir, Son, & Patton to erect stables on the east side of Elibank Street.

Extensive alterations are being made in Linlithgow West U.P. Church, including re-seating. A large hall is also being erected on an adjacent site for meetings and in connection with the church. While the alterations and extensions are being carried out the congregation are to worship in the County Buildings, the use of which has been granted by the County Council.

A meeting of the School Board of the Parish of Dundonald was held on 20th inst. at Troon. The Chairman reported that the Building Committee of Dundonald School had met on Friday, when, after examining the plans and reconsidering the whole question of the proposed class-rooms, it was recommend that two of the proposed class-rooms be excised altogether from the plans. This would reduce the accommodation from 420 to 340, or, if the gallery in entrance-hall were included, as sanctioned by the Education Department, the accommodation of the new school would be 300. It was unanimously agreed to cut down the plans as proposed, and to send them back to the Education Department for approval. Meanwhile it was resolved that the building should proceed. It is estimated that the saving effected by the proposed reduction in the size of the school will amount to between £400 and £500. The foundation-stone is to be laid by Lady Sophia Montgomerie on or about the 21st September.
