WHITE, JOSEPH GEORGE, builder, Emsworth, Hants.—The public examination of the above-named bankrupt came on for hearing at the Portsmouth Bankruptcy Court on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Renny. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt disclosed liabilities amounting to £323 7s. 8d., and the assets were estimated to produce £157 11s. 1d. Replying to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that when he commenced business he had a capital of £240. His failure had been caused through losses on contracts, and bad weather, and "having done his work too well." The Registrar remarked that that was only another name for under-estimating. The debtor was allowed to pass his examination.
