Sandison\n\nTHE DUNDEE BUILDING TRADE.\nSome weeks ago we drew attention to the improved condition of the building trade in Dundee and district.\nSince midsummer the applications to the Dean of Guild Court have been numerous and increasing.\nThe probable causes of this are twofold.\nDuring the severe crisis through which Dundee's principal industry has been passing capitalists feared an exodus rather than an increase of population, and a consequent cessation of demand for new shops or dwellings.\nBut an industry so well established as the jute manufacture of Dundee is not easily killed out, and a people so intelligent and energetic either adapt their ways to the changing conditions or turn to different occupations.\nIncreased capital accumulates, even at a small return, among an economical people.\nAnd thus the recent slight revival in the jute industry and the fuller employment of labour has given the courage to invest capital in building operations, which now promise a fair interest.\nThe low rates of interest obtainable from other investments, home or foreign, and even from investments not unattended with risk, as also the recently current low prices of building materials and labour afford a further inducement.\nWhether all or any of these be the true reason for the present activity in the Dundee building trade, the fact is incontestable that every good, and, indeed, every passable workman is fully employed.\nThe aid of Kirkcaldy, St. Andrews, and the smaller towns or villages surrounding Dundee, in the inrush of workmen, has been unavoidable, for wages have been advanced to a par with other cities.\nThis has accepted home contracts builders who had had to leave their men drafted off could not afford to go to other quarters.\nBut it is quite possible to carry the advance too far.\nIf this is done, one of the strongest inducements for the capitalist to undertake further investments will be removed, and the incipient “boom” may be checked.\nIt is between temporary employment at a fair living wage, free from the inevitable hardship and loss which strikes always entail.\nThe timber trade is, perhaps, more directly interested in the continuance of this current of investment than any other, but all trades are more or less interested, and any check upon the supply of capital and demand must be deplored.\nIt is amid general prosperity that employment for labour is most readily and most permanently found.\n\nALTERATIONS AT A BO'NESS SAW-MILL.\n—A meeting of the Dean of Guild Court was held last week, when plans were submitted and passed for the demolition of the existing wooden erections of Messrs. Love & Stewart's saw-mill, Grangepans, and for the re-erection of more suitable premises in brickwork.\nThe arrangements seem very complete, accommodation being provided for male and female workers separately.\nThe design, which is tasteful, is in red brick, with white facings, while the roof is of ornamental iron castings.\n\nA. & W.
