GREENOCK.
The only importation of timber here this week is a part cargo of 4,972 logs pitch pine timber and 1,631 pieces pitch pine deals per “Cuban,” from Pensacola, and which is consigned to Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells.
Other items by this steamer are 1,800 logs fustic, also several pieces divi-divi, and general merchandise.
The auction which Messrs. M'Dowall & Neilson intended to have held at the Esplanade on Thursday last was postponed, owing to the late arrival of the “Akaba” (s), until Thursday next, September 5th, by which time the deals ex this steamer will have been piled and lotted for sale.

LEITH.
The arrivals of wood goods during the week are unimportant, consisting mainly of 30,215 deal and batten ends, per “Salween,” from Archangel, and 155 logs and 36 pieces aspen, per “Henrika,” from Pernau, for Messrs. Forslind & Rex.
Messrs. John Mitchell & Co. held a large sale at their Leith Walk Saw-mills, and, as usual, had a large representative company from both town and country.
The catalogue included a very large and varied assortment of both American and Baltic wood goods, and although the weather was most unfavourable a large quantity was disposed of at very satisfactory prices.
The choicest board pine fetched from 2s. 10d. to 3s. 1d. for large and 2s. to 2s. 4d. per cube foot for smaller logs.
Quebec oak was sold at 2s. 10d. to 2s. 11d., elm 2s. 3d. to 2s. 4d., and canary whitewood 2s. to 2s. 4d. per cube foot.
A large quantity of 1st yellow pine deals and clear boards were disposed of at 3s. 2d. to 3s. 3d. per cubic foot, and deals of 1st quality, brought 2s. 4d. to 2s. 6d.
The best quality pitch pine boards found buyers at 1s. 9d. per cubic foot.
There was also a large line of 3rd yellow pine deals sold at 1s. 5d. per cubic foot.
Of Baltic deals and battens a fair quantity was placed, and some big lines of flooring, lining, and sarkings.
Altogether the exposers had a very successful sale.

ARRANGEMENTS have been made for the erection of new ammonia works for the manufacture of by-products in connection with the Eglinton Iron Works at Kilwinning, which are owned by Messrs. William Baird & Co.
The site of the building will be near one of the furnaces, and will be connected with the main railway.

THE DUNDEE BUILDING TRADE.
Some weeks ago we drew attention to the improved condition of the building trade in Dundee and district.
Since midsummer the applications to the Dean of Guild Court have been numerous and increasing.
The probable causes of this are twofold.
During the severe crisis through which Dundee's principal industry has been passing capitalists feared an exodus rather than an increase of population, and a consequent cessation of demand for new shops or dwellings.
But an industry so well established as the jute manufacture of Dundee is not easily killed out, and a people so intelligent and energetic either adapt their ways to the changing conditions or turn to different occupations.
Increased capital accumulates, even at a small return, among an economical people.
And thus the recent slight revival in the jute industry and the fuller employment of labour has given the courage to invest capital in building operations, which now promise a fair interest.
The low rates of interest obtainable from other investments, home or foreign, and even from investments not unattended with risk, as also the recently current low prices of building materials and labour afford a further inducement.
Whether all or any of these be the true reason for the present activity in the Dundee building trade, the fact is incontestable that every good, and, indeed, every passable workman is fully employed.
The aid of Kirkcaldy, St. Andrews, and the smaller towns or villages surrounding Dundee, in the inrush of workmen, has been unavoidable, for wages have been advanced to a par with other cities.
This has accepted home contracts builders who had had to leave their men drafted off could not afford to go to other quarters.
But it is quite possible to carry the advance too far.
If this is done, one of the strongest inducements for the capitalist to undertake further investments will be removed, and the incipient “boom” may be checked.
It is between temporary employment at a fair living wage, free from the inevitable hardship and loss which strikes always entail.
The timber trade is, perhaps, more directly interested in the continuance of this current of investment than any other, but all trades are more or less interested, and any check upon the supply of capital and demand must be deplored.
It is amid general prosperity that employment for labour is most readily and most permanently found.

ALTERATIONS AT A BO'NESS SAW-MILL.
—A meeting of the Dean of Guild Court was held last week, when plans were submitted and passed for the demolition of the existing wooden erections of Messrs. Love & Stewart's saw-mill, Grangepans, and for the re-erection of more suitable premises in brickwork.
The arrangements seem very complete, accommodation being provided for male and female workers separately.
The design, which is tasteful, is in red brick, with white facings, while the roof is of ornamental iron castings.
