FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes to the full amount.]
BATES, J., builder, Chorley Wood.--At the last sitting of the St. Albans Bankruptcy Court this debtor, whose deficiency is £248, was examined at length. He commenced business in 1869, and has done a considerable amount of work since then. Among the creditors were Messrs. Ropkins & Co., Limited, of Watford, whose account is £50. The examination was adjourned for the debtor to prepare a full statement of his affairs.
CHISLETT, HUBERT WARE, of Chislett & Lewis, yacht builders, Poole.--The adjourned public examination of this debtor took place before Mr. Registrar Dicken, at the Poole Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday week. The Official Receiver complained that the debtor was ordered to supply an account at the last court, within fourteen days, but that had not been done. The debtor stated that the account on the previous day, and he had not yet had an opportunity of going through it. The statement purported to show a full statement of his separate assets and liabilities, but was, on the face of it, not correct because it was an absurd account. The debtor seemed to be treating the court with contempt. The Registrar said the debtor must comply with the order of the court to the best of his ability. The examination was then ordered to be further adjourned until the next court.
GLOSSOP, THOMAS, builder and contractor, Alfred Street, Sparkbrook, Birmingham.--The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this recent failure was held on Thursday last at the offices of the Official Receiver, Birmingham. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £865 1s. 2d., and the deficiency was returned at £721 0s. 4d. It appeared from the Official Receiver's report and observations that the debtor, until 1891, was a journeyman carpenter. He then commenced business in Newton Row, Birmingham, without any capital, as a builder. He estimated that in 1892 he lost £200 through building three villas at Northfield. In 1894 the bankrupt built eight houses in Bristol Road, Northfield, for which he received £1,040 on mortgage of the lease. He then commenced building ten more houses, obtaining £1,400 on account, but he stated that a lease had not yet been granted to him. On July 13th last the work was stopped owing to want of funds, and the bankrupt found that he had no alternative but to take bankruptcy proceedings. The debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through heavy expenses, loss in building, illness of wife, and law charges. The debtor, in reply to questions put by the Official Receiver, said he became aware of the fact that he had not sufficient assets to pay his creditors in full in 1892. He was not in a position to make any offer of composition to his creditors. Finally, it was resolved to vest the estate in the Official Receiver as trustee.

HILLIER, EDWARD, builder, of 28, Meyrick Road, Clapham Junction, S.W.--On Saturday Mr. Alexr. Mackintosh, Official Receiver for the Wandsworth district, issued particulars of this failure. The receiving order was made on a creditor's petition, and the debtor has been adjudged bankrupt. He states that he commenced business seven years ago with no capital beyond his household furniture, valued at from £60 to £70. He is now living at 12, Trafalgar Road, Strawberry Hill. His late residence and business premises, 28, Meyrick Road, Clapham Junction, he states he holds on a fourteen years' lease (seven years' unexpired), at a rent of £33 10s. per annum. The lease is stated to be held by a Mr. Knappman, of Albert Embankment, with whom it was deposited about three months ago to secure an advance of £16 10s. The debtor states that in September, 1893, he gave a bill of sale to a Mr. James Moore, of 161 to 164, York Road, Battersea, over the whole of his furniture, stock, plant, fixtures, and fittings, the consideration being £100 then advanced, and he also states that about the same time he sold a portion of the furniture covered by the bill of sale, with the verbal consent of the bill of sale holder. He states that he did not become aware of his insolvency until May last, when an execution was levied by one of his creditors. The only books of account kept by him were a day book and a ledger, and these are written up to May last, when he ceased business. No balance-sheets or statement of assets and liabilities have been made during the last three years. The debtor has not lodged a complete statement of his affairs, but it would appear that his unsecured liabilities amount to £262, and that he has no assets.

therefore copy that he will be glad to receive from creditors as to the debtor's affairs.
HUBBARD, PERCY R., builder, of 9, Mead Place, and Tamworth Road, Croydon.--On Tuesday Mr. Alexander Mackintosh, Official Receiver for the Croydon district, issued particulars of this failure. The liabilities expected to rank for dividend are £2,832 15s. 10d., and the assets (including book debts, £161 12s. 9d.) are £357 17s. 5d., leaving a deficiency of £2,474 18s. 5d. The debtor attributes his failure to "losses through under-estimating on contracts and through strikes." An order was made on the bankrupt's own petition. He states that he commenced business as a builder about four years ago, and for three years been a house decorator, with a capital of about £50, of which £30 was borrowed from his wife. The contingent liabilities are in respect of amounts still due under guarantees given, and which have been assigned to a creditor as a security for £[?].
HUGHES, DANIEL, trading as Daniel Hughes & Co., timber merchant, 227A, Derby Road, Bootle.--The public examination of the above-named bankrupt took place at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Cooper, on Thursday last week. The summary of accounts filed by the bankrupt disclosed liabilities amounting to £1,620, and the nett assets, which consisted principally of an estimated surplus from securities in the hands of fully-secured creditors, were returned at £357. Replying to questions put by the Assistant Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he began business as a saw-mill proprietor at Bootle in November, 1893, with a capital of £50 of his own. He afterwards borrowed £200 from his sister-in-law, and from time to time she had advanced other sums. He agreed to pay interest on these loans, but no arrangement was made as to when the loans should be repaid. His sister-in-law had not proved against his estate for these loans, and she did not intend to do so. He admitted that he had been in an insolvent position since 1893. He should think he was £450 to the bad at the end of that year 1894. He was £450 to the bad, but nevertheless he continued in business, hoping matters would improve. In July last an execution was levied upon his effects, but after that he ordered an engine and boiler from Messrs. Ransome on the hire-purchase system. His intention was to commence business in his wife's name, under the style of E. Hughes, and he was to act as manager. The debtor was then examined at considerable length with regard to some property he had purchased eighteen months ago he purchased certain property for £1,100. He paid £900 on account, and agreed to do work for the balance. He then created a chief rent for £18 per annum, which he sold for £360, and then mortgaged the property for £650, so that one way and another he received £1,010 for property for which he had paid £1,100. About the beginning of last year he bought the equity of certain property, subject to a mortgage of £900, for £10. The property was purchased in his wife's name, but he had no particular reason for doing that. He had collected the rents, and his wife made no claim to the property. The examination was then adjourned.
LAYBERRY, WILLIAM, builder, Derby Street, Burton-on-Trent.--The public examination of the above-named bankrupt took place at the Burton Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last. The summary of accounts filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £2,242 13s. 10d., and the assets, after deducting the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, were estimated to produce £650 11s. 1d. Upon the application of the Official Receiver the examination was ordered to be adjourned.
