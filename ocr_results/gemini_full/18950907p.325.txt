There are heavier arrivals of wood goods to report this week, consisting of 1,986 lds. battens per "Tronda" (s), from Drontheim; 79 deals and battens and 4,085 staves of wood per "Moravia" (s), from New York; 1,706 deals and battens per "Moscow" (s), from Cronstadt; and 33 poplar logs per "Roma" (s), from New York. The cargo at per "Tronda" (s), and the bulk of that at "Moscow" (s), are for Messrs. Mitchell & Co., whilst the rest are divided among various importers. The arrival is reported of the "Eleanor" (s), from Quebec, with a full cargo of timber and deals for Messrs. Park, Dobeson, & Co., being the second steamer cargo from Quebec this season.
Mr. D. W. Beattie held a public sale on Tuesday, 3rd inst., at the Edinburgh Hotel. The goods offered included a parcel of Quebec high logs and American States oak. The former, being put up without reserve, was entirely cleared, but prices were extreme, ranging from 11d. to 13 1/2d. per cubic foot. The States oak was withdrawn in the want of competition, the parcel being of really prime quality. Of Baltic deals and battens a fair proportion of the various descriptions offered found buyers at prices similar to those of recent auctions. White battens were firmly held, and for what was sold full prices were got. 2 1/2x6 1/2 running from 1s. 2d. to 1s. 2 1/2d. per lineal foot.

THE RESTORATION OF SMAILHOLM PARISH CHURCH.—The heritors of the Presbytery of Earlston and the heritors of Smailholm have approved of plans for the improvement of the Parish Church. Estimates have been accepted, and the work will proceed immediately. The plans, prepared by Messrs. Hardy & Wight, architects, Edinburgh, embrace in their entirety the complete restoration of the building, but they cannot at present be fully carried out owing to the lack of necessary funds. The work to be now done includes mainly what is necessary for the better accommodation of the worshippers, with a new chancel arch and gable for the nave. The expenditure will provide for new roof and floor, new seating, and new heating apparatus, with a small north transept or vestry, at a cost of about £500. To this amount the heritors and Baird Trust contribute £170, and the rest has been obtained from private subscriptions through the Rev. W. L. Sime, minister of the parish. The church is one of the oldest in the south of Scotland. The plan, comprising nave and chancel, and most of the masonry of the fabric, is as it left the builder's hands in the middle or end of the fourteenth century.
