FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that creditors whose names are published hold security for their debts, the value of which is not stated.]
COOK, CORNWALL, builder, Truro.
The receiving order herein was made on the 19th August, 1895, and the debtor has filed a petition which shows gross liabilities £977 14s. 6d., which are expected to rank for dividend. The net assets are estimated to produce £464 1s. 7d. He alleges the cause of his failure want of capital and bad debts. The Official Receiver reports that the debtor commenced business at Truro in September, 1889, is claimed by his wife. He had no capital of his own, but his wife and the creditors for money lent, and there is a policy of assurance on the debtor's life for £100. The following are creditors:-
Butchers, W., Wootton, L.W.
Cook, H. L., Bromley
Retallack, M. C., Lostwithiel
Blamey, H. T. & J., Ryle, L.W.
Paul, W., Spring Vale, L.W.
Olver, W. & Son, Sea View, L.W.
Steele & Hame, London
Sharp, A. & Co., Newport, L.W.
DANIELL, THOMAS, builder, Stamford Street, London.
A meeting under this failure was held on Monday before Mr. Gray, Assistant Official Receiver. The accounts were filed, but the debtor returned his liabilities at about £300 and his assets at £10. He attributes his failure to loss in trade and loss through the sale of some property at Warminster. There was no resolution, and the debtor's affairs will be wound up in bankruptcy, the Official Receiver being the trustee.
EDDISON, JOHN THOMAS, builder, Lancashire.
The public examination of this debtor was held at the Bolton Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Dodge. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed a deficiency of £2,571. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he was formerly in partnership in the building trade, and that when he commenced building at Leigh seven years ago he had about £500 on the security of his wife's property. He had also his grandfather's will. For some time he confined himself to the sale of timber and other building materials, and he did well. During the last twelve months he was crippled through bad debts and competition, and as he could not meet his liabilities he filed his petition. He formerly had an agent at Manchester, but it was not true to say that he had paid him £300 for commission. Eventually the examination was ordered to be closed.
HILLIER, EDWARD, builder, 4, Trafalgar Road, Strawberry Vale, East Finchley, and Meyrick Road, Clapham Junction.
The first meeting of the creditors under this failure was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, 24, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E., on Friday, under the presidency of the Assistant Official Receiver. Mr. G. W. Chapman. The meeting were of opinion that the case required strict investigation, and they put several questions until the debtor had passed his public examination. Eventually it was decided to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver.
HUBBARD, PERCY R., builder and contractor, 2, Mond Place, North Woolwich, trading at Gurney's Yard, Barking Road, Canning Town.
The first meeting of the creditors interested under this failure was held on Tuesday at the offices of the Official Receiver for the Croydon district, 24, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E., under the presidency of Mr. J. H. ROW.
