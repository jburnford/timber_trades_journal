RE-AFFORESTING IN WALES.
In his forthcoming report to the [?] the Commissioner of Woods, [?] sentations having been made to him [?] of carrying out planting operations [?] of the Crown wastes in Wales, [?] opportunity over those during October [?] and had in the neighbourhood of [?] a meeting with some of the [?] farmers who were interested in the [?] walks or common rights upon them. [?] it seemed to him that there were [?] where they quite possibly could [?] many other considerable tracts [?] carefully weighed before any [?] posal of the kind can be [?] give reasonable hope of success. [?] the plantations were extensive [?] the fact that, though made with [?] fenced, each owner of common [?] practice his own particular sheep [?] would be some difficulty in dealing [?] the rights of the commoners [?] readjusted.
To deprive one of [?] farms of its sheep walk would be [?] held to seriously damage the value [?] farm as a whole.
The accessibility [?] ground and the nearness of railway [?] munication, are also serious elements [?] problem, and I am therefore taking [?] opportunities as I can to visit the [?] other parts of North Wales before [?] ing to make any definite proposal [?] connection with any one of them. [?] plantation, mainly for purposes of [?] has been made on a small Crown [?] Merioneth, adjoining the waste of [?] wrog mountain.
The very severe [?] experienced last winter greatly [?] with the work, and added to the [?] and the exceptionally dry spring [?] very trying to the young trees [?] which, however, were doing well [?] inspected it in the month of June.

NEW DOCK BOARD DREDGER.
A new barge-loading dredger, one of the largest and most powerful vessels of its class afloat, was launched on Tuesday with all its machinery on board at the works of Messrs.
William Simons & Co., Limited, Renfrew.
It is built to the order of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, and has all the latest improvements, and is specially adapted for rock dredging.
It is fitted with two sets of triple-cylinder engines for propelling, and one independent set for dredging to a depth of 50ft.
It has two steel boilers 160 lb. working pressure, and a powerful 360 lb. hydraulic test; three independent sets of engines for ladder hoist and side winches, two powerful crabs at bow and stern, central crab for mooring, and chain of steel buckets, adapted to cut their own way into banks and shoals and to fill themselves with the hardest of water.
The buckets have strong steel mouth plates and renewable steel teeth for dealing with rock and other hard material.
The total weight of the bucket chain is 100 tons, exclusive of the ladder and mountings.
The vessel is subdivided into thirteen watertight compartments, and the bulkheads carried to upper deck.
It has electric light appliances, steam steering and reversing gear, Weir's feed water heater, evaporator, and Harris's water filter are provided.
A 5-ton derrick crane.
The main framing of the dredger is of steel.
The vessel is armoured with greenheart belting, and the shoots are armoured with guards.
The hopper shoots are wound round them for safety.
It has a large independent surface condenser with separate centrifugal air and circulating pumping engines, and two powerful pumps for supplying water to the shoots and condensers and to the shoots, are also provided.
The dredger has been constructed under the direction of the Mersey Dock Board's engineer, Mr. A. G. Lyster, C.E. Mr. W. H. Le Mesurier, superintending engineer, and Mr. A. Brown, son, resident inspector.
This is the forty-fifth vessel constructed by Messrs. William Simons & Co. for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.

MODERN WOOD-WORKING MACHINERY.—This new book, by Mr. J. Stafford Ransome, has been received by the technical press with what may be called a chorus of praise.
That authority says it will be welcomed by those who are engaged in the timber trade, by those who are interested in the conversion of tree felling in the forest to the final business of ship or house building, and by those who are engaged in the manufacture of wood-working machinery, and in the saw mill.
