It is a wasteful method to leave timber to be seasoned by the capricious elements, for the results are bound to be irregular. The more exposed parts will become weatherbeaten and warped, while the rest still remains damp and green.
The case is quite different with ERITH'S HOT BLAST TIMBER DRYING KILNS, where all desirable conditions are constantly maintained. The necessary quantity of air is uniformly circulated throughout the drying kilns at the most suitable velocity, while the temperature and humidity are also perfectly uniform and under control at all times. The timber is taken out dried exactly to the point required, in all seasons; it is neither dried too much nor too little, but in such a manner that it will never shrink or swell after going into any class of work.
