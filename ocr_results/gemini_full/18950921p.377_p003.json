Austin & Co.—The public examination of this bankrupt was held last Tuesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard.\nThe accounts show total liabilities £2,428 6s. 8d., of which £1,226 4s. 8d. is expected to rank, and assets £147 12s., subject to preferen-tial claims amounting to £74 6s.\nA previous adjudication of bankruptcy is recorded against the bankrupt in July, 1890, his liabilities then amounting to £3,503 and the assets to £447.\nHe obtained his discharge under those proceedings in December, 1890, subject to a suspension of eighteen months.\nThe bankrupt stated in his preliminary examination that after the former failure the stock, furniture, and effects were purchased from the trustee by Mr. Thos. Hay-ward, who carried on the business under his (bankrupt's) management for a month or two, and then sold it for £150 to his (bankrupt's) wife, by whom he was also employed as manager; that in October, 1894, having in the interval obtained his discharge from the 1890 bankruptcy, he took over the business from his wife, and discharged the outstanding liabilities.\nIn issuing the usual observations to the creditors on Tuesday the Official Receiver further reported that within the last few days a claim has been put forward on behalf of the bankrupt's wife to the whole of the assets of the business on the ground that she has never transferred them to her husband.\nSince then the bankrupt has informed the Official Receiver that the state-ments made by him at the preliminary exami-nation are incorrect ; that as a matter of fact the business was never transferred to him by his wife; but that on the contrary he has acted throughout as her manager, at a salary of £3 a week.\nThe bankrupt was questioned\n\n379\n& CO.,\nDepot in N. Wales—\nPORTMADOC, DEGANWY WHARF\nUNFADING GREEN\nTILES\nat some length by Mr. Egerton S. Grey, Assistant Receiver, regarding the real owner-ship of the business, and repeated that it had not been transferred to him by his wife, and that consequently the assets were not his pro-perty.\nThe examination was ordered to be concluded.\nBADDELEY, WILLIAM H., builder, Brown Street, Hanley.—Under this registered deed the following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nBrindley, J.
