FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
AUSTIN, JAMES, timber merchant, Barking Road, trading as J. Austin & Co.—The public examination of this bankrupt was held last Tuesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard.
The accounts show total liabilities £2,428 6s. 8d., of which £1,226 4s. 8d. is expected to rank, and assets £147 12s., subject to preferen-tial claims amounting to £74 6s.
A previous adjudication of bankruptcy is recorded against the bankrupt in July, 1890, his liabilities then amounting to £3,503 and the assets to £447.
He obtained his discharge under those proceedings in December, 1890, subject to a suspension of eighteen months.
The bankrupt stated in his preliminary examination that after the former failure the stock, furniture, and effects were purchased from the trustee by Mr. Thos. Hay-ward, who carried on the business under his (bankrupt's) management for a month or two, and then sold it for £150 to his (bankrupt's) wife, by whom he was also employed as manager; that in October, 1894, having in the interval obtained his discharge from the 1890 bankruptcy, he took over the business from his wife, and discharged the outstanding liabilities.
In issuing the usual observations to the creditors on Tuesday the Official Receiver further reported that within the last few days a claim has been put forward on behalf of the bankrupt's wife to the whole of the assets of the business on the ground that she has never transferred them to her husband.
Since then the bankrupt has informed the Official Receiver that the state-ments made by him at the preliminary exami-nation are incorrect ; that as a matter of fact the business was never transferred to him by his wife; but that on the contrary he has acted throughout as her manager, at a salary of £3 a week.
The bankrupt was questioned

at some length by Mr. Egerton S. Grey, Assistant Receiver, regarding the real owner-ship of the business, and repeated that it had not been transferred to him by his wife, and that consequently the assets were not his pro-perty.
The examination was ordered to be concluded.

BEBROUTH, GEORGE W., builder, of Church Street, and St. Saviour's Road, Croydon.—On Wednesday Mr. Mackintosh, Official Receiver for the Croydon district, issued par-ticulars of this failure.
The gross liabilities are £1,912, of which £1,848 2s. 8d. is expected to rank for dividend, and the available assets are £117 7s. 6d., showing a deficiency of £1,730 15s. 2d.
The receiving order was made on a creditor's petition, and the debtor has been adjudged bankrupt.
He attributes his failure to "ignorance of the trade, having to trust to others to buy materials and do the work." The creditors shown as fully secured hold a quantity of bricks and timber.
Those shown as partly secured hold four bills of exchange and some deals.
A quantity of effects (the Official Receiver says) appear to have been moved to various premises, and inquiries are being made as to these.
The debtor states that he became aware of his insolvency in July last, and that he has contracted no debts since then.
The debtor considers that on March 25th last he was £300 to the good, and that he has lost £1,994 by carrying on business since that date.
He has a wife and two daughters to support, and he says he will be glad to receive information from creditors as to the debtor's conduct.

BROUGHTON, RICHARD, builder and contractor, Chapel Lane, Stretford.—The public examination of this bankrupt took place at the Bankruptcy Court, on Mon-day, before Mr. Registrar Atkinson.
The debtor was examined at considerable length as to whether he was not the real owner of the business carried on in Vine Street, Openshaw, Manchester, in his son's name.
The debtor emphatically denied that he had any interest in the business, and asserted that he passed it over to his son about eighteen months ago with a capital of £100, which he had previously saved whilst in a situation.
At one time he was worth £800, but owing to losses on contracts at Old Trafford and Stretford he now had a deficiency of £652.
His wife had some property worth £1,000, but it was mortgaged to its full value.
Eventually it was decided to adjourn the examination until the next Court.
