BUILDING NEWS.
The Kilmarnock School Board propose to build a new academy on Elmbank Estate, at an estimated cost of £10,000. The school will provide accommodation for 800 scholars.
The Glasgow Town Council have approved a recommendation by the finance committee that a sum of £5,000 should be voted towards the erection of a new school of art in Glasgow, for which the Bellahouston trustees offer a site and a contribution of £6,000.
A building at the foot of Airlie Street, Alyth, is to be converted into a showroom for Messrs. Illingworth & Co. We hear the following contracts have been sealed :— Mason, Mr. John Howie; joiner, Mr. John Smart; slater, Mr. G. Crichton.
At the monthly Dean of Guild Court at Coatbridge, Messrs. A. & J. Stewart & Clydesdale, Limited, petitioned for leave to erect sheds within their British Tube Works in Dundyvan, and there being no coterminous proprietors the petition was granted.
At the meeting of the Stranraer Dean of Guild Court, plans were passed for a new mill at Sheuchan. The old premises were destroyed by fire in November last, and the new mill which is about to be erected will be one of the largest in the West of Scotland.
It is said that the Paisley Baptist Church is the costliest Nonconformist church in Great Britain. On this edifice no less than £100,000 was expended, nearly £70,000 more than the original cost of the Metropolitan Tabernacle, and £37,000 more than it cost to erect Christ Church, in Westminster Bridge Road, London, which is admitted to be the costliest modern place of worship in the metropolis.
At the meeting of the Brechin Police Commissioners, it was reported that a number of offers had been received for the supply of the water main, which the Board decided some time ago to lay from the reservoir to a point opposite Mr. Hood's property in Southesk Street. The lowest offer was that of Messrs. M'Farlane, Strang, & Co., Limited, Lochburn Ironworks, Glasgow, who proposed to supply the pipes for the sum of £1,025 18s. 11d.
The Paisley Dean of Guild Court have granted a warrant to Mr. W. P. Robertson, Stonefield Laundry, Colinslee, to make additions to his works there, consisting of iron and packing rooms. Two petitions were continued, viz. Henry M'Naughton, cooper, Hawkhead Road, to erect a workshop and three-story tenement of dwelling-houses on the west side of Hawkhead Road; and Messrs. Philpot & Watkin, builders, to erect four tenements of dwelling-houses, three stories high, at Seedhill Road.
Building operations at Ramsay Road, Kirkcaldy, are going on rapidly. Already the large block of dwelling-houses for Mr. Philip has been roofed in, as well as that one for Mr. Anderson adjoining. A commencement has been made with two other blocks.
