BARNS, JOHN RICHARD, builder, 2, Fitzgerald Road, Mortlake, and Woodham Lane, Newhaw, Addlestone, Surrey.—On Wednesday, Mr. Alex. Mackintosh, Official Receiver for the Wandsworth district, issued particulars of this failure under a receiving order made on September 5th. The gross liabilities are £5,654 4s. 9d., of which £1,341 14s. 9d. is unsecured, and there are no assets save 8s. at the bank. The debtor attributes his failure to "want of capital and inability to raise money on mortgage to enable me to finish properties I was building under agreements, and in consequence of which the freeholders have taken possession." The bankrupt, against whom a receiving order was made in the same Court on April 19th, 1888, and whose statement of affairs then disclosed unsecured liabilities amounting to £3,179 6s. 8d. and no assets, and who received his discharge under that bankruptcy on August 11th, 1891, states that he has been a speculative builder for the past thirty years. In addition to the bankruptcy already referred to, it would appear that in 1870, when in business as a builder at 18, Sidney Villas, Richmond, the bankrupt paid a composition of 2s. in the pound on unsecured liabilities of £2,000, and that in or about 1872, being still in business as a builder at Richmond, he was again obliged to call his creditors together, his unsecured liabilities being £600, but in this case no composition whatever was paid. Almost the whole of the liabilities are in respect of materials supplied and work done. The bankrupt states that he became aware of his insolvency in February, 1894, since when he has contracted debts to the amount of £700 or £800 with most of his creditors, which debts he hoped to pay by obtaining advances on a mortgage of the houses at Addlestone, which he anticipated would realise a surplus of £1,000. The bankrupt states that he kept a cash book, creditors' ledger and wages book, but no balance-sheets or statements of assets and liabilities appear to have been made at any time during the last three years. No account has been kept by the bankrupt of his household and personal expenses, but he has stated that his drawings have been as follows:—£4 a week from July, 1892, to July, 1893; £3 10s. a week from July, 1893, to July, 1894, and £5 a week since. The Official Receiver states that he will be glad to receive information from any of the bankrupt's conduct and affairs.

on that amount, and he had no prospect of being able to pay the 10s. in the £. He was willing to take a sum of £200. The Assistant Official Receiver, on behalf of creditors, opposed the application. After considerable length of discussion, the debtor agreed to vary the order, as in that form it could be paid, consequently the order was made as it was.
BEBROUTH, W., builder, Church Street, and St. Saviour's Road, Croydon.—The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this failure was held on Wednesday last, at the offices of the Official Receiver, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £1,912 10s. 2d., of which £1,794 14s. 4d. was due to unsecured creditors. The total liabilities were expected to rank against the estate for dividend at £1,848 2s. 8d. The assets were estimated to produce £135 15s., from which £18 7s. 6d. had to be deducted for the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaving nett assets at £117 7s. 6d., and showing a deficiency of £1,730 15s. 2d. The debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through ignorance of the trade, having to trust others to buy materials, and to do the work. The Official Receiver, after reading over the proofs, said this was a matter required thorough investigation. He had discovered that a consignment of materials had been sent to various persons in the town, although the debtor had been removed without his instructions; but as it was debtor's property, he must be held responsible for it. The debtor had also sent a large quantity of timber to Mr. Waters, timber merchant, of Croydon, to be cut which that gentleman now claimed a lien both in respect of the cost of cutting and drying, and also in respect of an old debt. No doubt Mr. Waters was entitled to claim a lien in respect of the cutting, drying and storage, but as to claiming a lien in respect to the old debt, that was another question, and he was afraid Mr. Waters would find that claim would not hold good in a court of law. Mr. Street, of Messrs. Ward, Perks, & Mackay, who appeared for Messrs. Palfreman, Foster, & Co. (creditors for over £100), and other firms, said he tried to serve debtor with a writ in July, but failing to do so he had to obtain an order for substituted service. The debtor was then questioned at great length with regard to a letter he had shown to certain creditors, upon the strength of which they gave him further credit. It appeared that the debtor was trustee under his father's will, and upon the freehold property being realised the auctioneer wrote him a letter stating that the property had been sold for £900, which amount was lying to his credit. The debtor showed this letter to certain creditors, and inferred that the money was his own, whereas, as a matter of fact, he had only a fifth share in the estate. It was eventually it was unanimously decided to appoint Mr. R. J. Ward, of Messrs. Ward & Wilding, accountants, Clement's Inn, as trustee, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection, consisting of the following gentlemen :—Mr. James Maxwell, Mr. Patten, and Mr. Thomas William Vigers. The remuneration of the trustee was left to the committee of inspection.
BORTHWICK, WM., builder, 5, Moss Street, Great Clowes Street, Lower Broughton. —A statement of affairs has been issued by the Official Receiver (Mr. C. J. Dibb) in this case.
