ALLAN, WILLIAM, jun., brick manu-facturer, Hamiltonhill, Possil Road, Glasgow.—At the Glasgow Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, this debtor was examined before Sheriff Spens.
Mr. Duncan, writer, for the agent in the sequestration, said he commenced business fifteen years ago with a capital of £200, extended his drying-shed at a cost of £100.
About three years ago he got into difficulties on account of some coal accounts coming against him.
He had borrowed some money, with which he was able to pay off all claims.
About a year ago he was again pressed by a coal company, and diligence was taken out against him.
He borrowed £100 from Mr. William T. Law, his brother-in-law.
That was a temporary loan.
Through his wife he borrowed £300 and paid back the £100 to Mr. Law.
He was pressed by another coal company, besides accounts for grain and oil.
A short time ago he found he could not carry on his business, and placed his affairs in the hands of an accountant, who made up a state of affairs, showing his liabilities to be £736 1s. 6d., and assets £406 15s. 7d.
He accounted for his losses by bad debts, the loss of a horse or two, and the coal strike, during which they were idle for two months.
In answer to Mr. Downie, writer, for a creditor, bankrupt went into his losses in further detail.
The examination was closed.

BLACKWELL, JAMES, builder, Hill Crest House, Westbury-on-Trym.—The public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Wright.
The debtor, in answer to questions, stated that he commenced business about four years ago with a capital of £20 of his own.
He had not kept any particular books of account.
He had lost money through build-ing speculations at Westbury.
Eventually the examination was adjourned until the next sitting of the Court.

BURDEN, ROBERT, late timber merchant, of Gwersyllt, Wrexham.—The adjourned public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Chester Bankruptcy Court, on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Giles.
Replying to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that a large proportion of the items referred to in the deficiency account, which were not posted to any particular account, and which amounted to £20,330, must be attributed to losses on timber purchases.
He could not swear as to whether £7,867 was in regard to interest on money borrowed from Mr. Edwards.
His deficiency account now totalled £64,000.
There were two further items of loss by borrowing at high rates of interest, viz., Henry Jones, £152, and Harris £100.
He admitted that he had given “tips” ranging from £10 to £30 to the servants of “people from whom he had purchased timber” for assistance given to him.”
The Official Receiver: Among other practices which prevail in the trade, is what I might call “yourself” carriage accounts of railway companies?
The debtor was then asked what he meant by an expression in a letter dated September, 1892, to Messrs. Thrutchley Bros., to the effect that he had been able to “fake” carriage to Dolgelly and Penmaenpool, and was in a devil of a mess.
The debtor said that referred to a question as to whether the timber should be carried over bark or under bark.
At that time some of the companies carried it over bark and some under bark, and it was his endeavour to get the under bark measure.
The Official Receiver: Is it not a fact that you under-declared the measurement and the computed weight?
Debtor: No, sir.
They sent their own men to measure it; we did not measure it.
Replying to further questions, the debtor said he had borrowed altogether from a Birmingham money lender £3,300, and had eventually become liable for £12,500.
After the debtor had been further questioned with regard to his dealings with Messrs. Thrutchley Bros., the examination was ordered to be closed.

NORRIS & SONS, CHAS., timber merchants, Bolton.—On Monday the first meet-ing of the creditors of George Norris and Charles William Norris, trading as above, was held at Bolton, when Mr. John H. Scott, of the Timber Trades’ Association, was appointed trustee, with the following creditors as a com-mittee of inspection, viz., Messrs. J. Harrison (Harrison, Robinson, & Co.), R. Lumley (Lumley, Lloyd, & Co.), and J. Kendall (J. Kendall & Co.), all of Liverpool.
The debtors alleged their causes of insolvency to “want of capital, losses on contracts and by fire, interest on loans, speculation in land, and heavy depre-ciation of property.”
The gross liabilities are £29,372, of which £14,750 is expected to rank for dividends.
£5,134 is due to unsecured creditors.
The assets are estimated at £5,778 including stock-in-trade £660, and machinery and trade fixtures at £538.
There is thus a deficiency of £8,972.
The separate estate of George Norris shows a deficiency of £907.
The Official Receiver (Mr. T. H. Winder), in his observations, says that the debtors have carried on business in partnership since the death of their father in November of 1882.
By the will of the father, dated October, 1876, “he bequeathed his estate, consisting of the works, offices, sheds, plant, machinery, stock-in-trade, goodwill, &c., in Bridgeman Street, with certain cottage property in and about Bolton, to his sons, the above-named debtors, subject to the payment of three legacies of £2,000 each to his three daughters.
It became apparent that the estate of the late Mr. Norris was insufficient to meet these legacies, the fact being that subsequent to the execution of his will the late Mr. Norris had suffered a very heavy loss owing to a fire at his Bridgeman Street premises in 1877.
Consequently, in August, 1883, an arrangement was made by which the daughters agreed to accept promissory notes for £1,000, £500, and £500 in lieu of the legacies before mentioned.
These sums are still due to them, and are included in the list of unsecured creditors.”
The debtors therefore took over an estate which was encumbered by mortgages to the usual trade liabilities, in addition to which they believed to be solvent and capable of development.
Up to 1887 the business, which included building contracts, public sawing, packing-case making, and general joiners work, was satisfactory.
From 1885 to 1890 debtors engaged in numerous contracts for the erection of mills, public buildings, works, and cottages, but estimate that on the whole they lost money, and sub-sequently ceased to make a speciality for contracting for buildings, confining themselves

FREDERICK, carpenter and joiner, Warberry Road, West Torquay.—This debtor, on being publicly examined at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last, before Mr. Registrar Dawe, stated that his failure had been caused through illness con-sequent upon an accident, and loss of trade through same.
The immediate cause of his filing his petition was in consequence of pressure of creditors.
The examination was closed.
The meeting of creditors was held on the same day, but no resolutions were passed thereat, and consequently the estate will be administered in the usual way by the Official Receiver.

SEDDON, SHEPHERD, & CO., LIMITED.—A meeting of the creditors of this company was held on Tuesday at the Cannon Street Hotel, when nearly the whole of the creditors were represented.
The bank, who are the largest creditors, were represented by their solicitor, and Mr. Attlee, of the firm of Messrs. Attlee, appeared for Mr. Gutzeit, for whom Messrs. Boyson & Slee are agents.
Mr. Wintringham, solicitor, of Grimsby, represented Messrs. Churchill & Sim, and Mr. Holmes, of Ingle, Cooper, and Holmes, solicitors, representing Messrs. Alrutz and Co.
Mr. Foy representing the largest creditors, was voted to the chair, and the accountant of the company read the figures of the last balance-sheet.
The company was incor-porated in November, 1894, and, as already stated, the purchase price was put down at £50 000, made up of £38,000 stock, £10,000 book debts, and £2,000 the goodwill of the Ocean Wave, Limited.
The purchase price was paid to the vendors as regards £25,000 in 5 per cent. mortgage debentures, and as regards the balance in preference and ordinary shares.
Some curiosity was evinced in respect to an item of the Ocean Wave, Limited, which appears to be a company owning what may be practically called a merry-go-round, and which it was stated had not paid any dividend for some time past.
The principal point raised by the shareholders, however, was in reference to the debentures, which would seem had immediately after the incor-poration of the company been handed over to the bank as security for the debt owing to them by the partners in the old firm.
There was considerable discussion both as to the legality and propriety of this proceeding, and ultimately two resolutions were passed, the first that Mr. Seddon and Mr. Shepherd should be asked to apply to the Court for a winding-up order, and the second, that if they declined to do this the creditors should them-selves take the step.
The directors, Mr. Seddon and Mr. Shepherd, were then called into the room, and Mr. Shepherd stated that they were not prepared to adopt the course sug-
