He de[?] not consider himself insolvent, and he alleged [?]\n\nELMS AT HEREFORD.\nWhen in Hereford a short time since, Mr. George Davison (London) strolled into the beautiful Castle Green to see the grand old elm trees so frequently talked about as dangerous. He found this all figment, and writes as follows to the Hereford Times :—Of course, during high winds many things are blown down, such as chimneys, tiles, sign boards, and many other objects. Even in streets the best way to avoid these dangers is not to go out if you can help it, and if compelled to do so, to walk in the middle of the street; and, in public walks, not under old or large trees. I observed on my visit six of the Castle Green trees had been cut down by some thoughtless barbarian. This letter is written in order to save the others from such stupidty.\nMany years since a large number of elm trees were blown down on an estate between Worcester and Oxford, near the railway. The noble proprietor did not cut any down, and now they are an object of study of picturesque beauty I never saw so much havoc anywhere else as on this property. Now they have grown out, and although many were snapped off at heights from 10 to 20 and 30 ft., the scantling or branches have so grown that only the fine boles or trunks are looked at, and the whole is a marvel of recovered woodland beauty, which pleases the senses and delights the mind.\nIn the Royal Parks—Windsor, and others—they never cut down old trees; on the contrary, they cherish them, admitting by this practice that a fine old tree is one of the grandest objects of nature. Moreover, looking at the long time trees take to grow large, the greatest care should be taken to preserve them. Here, in Dulwich Park, the curator under the London County Council takes such care of them that one old tree close to a public walk is (being hollow) propped up inside with iron props to keep the outside wood and bark from falling in or breaking off, and the top is protected by iron netting to stop the boys from getting into the inside. This tree is nearly dead, and entirely hollow; and I mention the circumstance in order to show those who talk so glibly about cutting down these fine old trees in the Castle Green the care taken here in London in such cases. I would advise these same people to cultivate their taste by reading Sir Uvedale Price on the picturesque, if the book is in your Hereford Free Library. Trees alone form a canopy over us, and a frame to all other objects. In beauty, they not only far excel everything of inanimate nature, but their beauty is complete in itself.\nIf I were permitted to advise anything concerning the splendid old elms in the Castle Green, it would be to preserve them by all manner of means; and in order to obviate danger, to surround them with an unclimbable iron fence round the base of each tree. I observed that there was a path trodden round in most instances, to the great injury of these fine trees.\n\nJ. H. ROWNTRE[?]",
