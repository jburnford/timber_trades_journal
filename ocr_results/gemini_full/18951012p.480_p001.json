Allison, Cousland, & Co., brought together a large company, including a good number of country buyers, and an extensive business was done, as will be seen from the particulars given below.\nPortions of the catalogue were intimated \"without reserve,\" which doubtless less made the sale the more attractive; the result at any rate was amply satisfactory, as both in point of quantity disposed of, amount-ing to about 35,000 pieces, and prices obtained, the sale was a successful one.\nThe catalogue was of varied description, comprising 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Quebec yellow pine deals and ends, also red pine and N.B. spruce deals.\nTransactions were mostly in 1st pine, of which 16 000 pieces changed hands.\nOf the N.B. spruce deals comparatively few of the lots catalogued were disposed of; the spruce was firmly held, and the lots sold were at prices which show an improvement on recent rates.\nThe Glasgow imports for the week have consisted chiefly of the usual consignments of deals per steam liners from Montreal, the \"Pomeranian\" (s) and \"Alcides\" (s) being the arrivals to note since last writing. These steamers discharged at Yorkhill, where the storage is going forward excepting such portions as have been disposed of and go into consumers' hands ex quay.\nThe 75 logs mahogany per \"Scandinavian\" (s), which will be observed in the import list, have been sold, ex quay, by Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells.\nMessrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.'s auction sale at Yorkhill, Glasgow, on 9th inst:—\nQuebec 1st yellow pine deals—\nFt. In.

Coats, Paisley.\nThe \"Huldren\" (408), from Dalhousie, N.B., brings 9,088 spruce deals and 1,698 ends on account of John Wright & Son, Irvine.\nThe \"Theresa Cosulich\" (452), from Bangkok, is discharging 574 squares teak timber and 476 teak planks consigned to Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.\nThe \"Franz,\" which arrived at Tail-of-the-Bank some days ago with cargo of Bangkok teak for orders, has now been berthed at James Watt Dock for discharge.\nTrade here continues to be brisk, and saw-mills are well employed.\nA great number of shipyard joiners have been discharged lately pending the decision of the Clyde and Belfast shipbuilders' dispute.\n\nLEITH.\nSince last report the arrivals of wood goods consist of 3,895 oak staves per \"Monomoy\" (s), from New York; 77,050 oak staves per \"Erik Berentsen,\" from Memel; 3,289 deal ends and 6,988 pieces lathwood per \"Livonia\" (s), from Riga; 23,659 deals and battens per \"Ymuiden,\" from Cronstadt; 1,505 oak staves per \"Minemsha\" (s), from New York; 1,660 rickers per \"Czar\" (s), from St. Petersburg; 147 sleeper blocks, 10,394 deals and battens, and 6,838 pieces lathwood per \"Penelope\" (s), from Riga; 42,867 deals and battens per \"Petersburg\" (s), from Cronstadt; 128 1/2 fathoms firewood per \"Gunnar,\" from Helsingfors; and 7,667 battens per \"Trafalgar,\" from Uleaborg.\nThere is nothing special to remark regarding the timber trade this week; with further arrivals there is still considerable strain at the docks to overtake the landing and piling the various cargoes, and great pressure is being still put upon merchants to clear the quays.\n\nBACK TO WORK.—The joiners' strike at Grangemouth and district, which has lasted eleven weeks, has terminated, the men resuming work on the masters' terms.\n\nRAILWAY EXTENSION IN ABERDEENSHIRE.—A public meeting has been held at Rhynie for the purpose of considering the proposed extension of the railway to Upper Donside.\nThe following resolution was carried:—\"In view of the proposed railway extension to Upper Donside, this meeting would strongly urge upon the directors of the Great North of Scotland Railway that no such extension would be satisfactory that does not provide for the important interests in and around the villages of Lumsden and Rhynie; that the proposed extension from Alford would be detrimental to those interests, and will meet with the strenuous opposition of the whole community; a branch from or about Kennethmont, via Rhynie and Lumsden, would meet the legitimate requirements of this district, would tap important traffic, and will receive the hearty and unanimous support of this meeting.\"\n\nINAUGURATION OF COVE QUARRIES.—Extensive red and white stone quarries having been recently reopened on the property of the Honourable Mrs. Greville-Nugent (after a period of some years disuse), their formal inauguration took place last week, when a large number of guests assembled at Cove.\nA marquee, erected on ground overlooking the quarry, had been fitted up as a temporary chapel, with an altar, draped in a handsome frontal, on which a crucifix and six lamps were placed.\nHere an interesting service of benediction was held, with the full ceremonial of the Scottish Episcopal Church, the office for blessing a stone-quarry being used with the sanction of the Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway.\nImmediately at the close of the service, the locomotive engine, steam digger, and steam cranes were set in motion, and after an inspection of the works, which was unfortunately cut somewhat short by the rain, the clergy and guests retuned to the house, where they were entertained by the Honourable Patrick and Mrs. Greville-Nugent.\n\nGAZETTE.\nBRAID & CO. (James Braid trading as), joiner, 29, Queen Street, Dundee.—This is a case of sequestration, and the following is the statement of affairs as at August 26th of this year:—Liabilities, ordinary claims £612 19s., preferable claims, £36 18s., total £649 Assets, heritable property £220, stock-in-trade £51, book debts £53 15s.\nThe following rank as creditors:—\nGould & Laburn, Dundee ... ... £6 8 4\nSadler, Mrs, Dundee ... ... 30 0 0\nSlimman & Robertson, Dundee ... 50 0 0\nDickie, David, Dundee ... ... 29 4 7\nLindsay & Scott, Dundee ... ... 10 1 6\nBeath & Keay, Dundee ... ... 11 13 0\nStewart, J. & A., Dundee ... ... 7 1 0\nWillison, Andrew, Glasgow ... ... 96 0 0\nFairweather, James, Lenchars... ... 27 0 0\nLawson, William, Newport ... ... 38 2 11\nSimpson, Thomas, Tayport ... ... 40 0 0\nDewar & Lindsay, Dundee ... ... 13 0 0\n\nGARVIE, ROBERT G., agricultural engineer, Hardgate Works, Aberdeen.—Under this trust deed the following are creditors:—\nIngham, Clark, & Co., London ... £8 4 4\nAbernethy, James, & Co., Aberdeen ... 78 13 9\nSmith, J., & Co., Aberdeen ... ... 585 18 0\nMillar, R., & Son, Aberdeen ... ... 105 5 9\nGarvie, J., & Sons, Aberdeen ... ... 18 5 9\nFleming, J., & Co., Limited, Aberdeen 71 10 2\nBryce, H.
