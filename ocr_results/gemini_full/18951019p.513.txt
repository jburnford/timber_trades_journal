additional room, but more conducive to health and decency. Although the number of linings for public buildings had not been greatly increased, being eight as compared with six, the size and design of these had been of an exceptionally large and ornate character, as proved by the fact that their estimated value was £256,500, as compared with £27,000 in the previous year, and the highest for ten years. There had also been an increase of one in the number of churches, the total being only 13, as compared with their value was more than doubled, being £96,700, as compared with £45,000 in the previous year. The number of linings granted for warehouses and workshops was 354, of the value of £166,095; whilst the number of alterations and additions granted was 354, of the value of £256,630. The largest number of linings for dwelling-houses (46) was in the Queen's Park district, the next largest in the Eastern district (31), in the Maryhill district (19); whilst the smallest, as was perhaps to be expected (4), was in the Central district. There had also been 36 linings granted for new streets, ending 7,257 lineal yards, 4 1/8 miles.
