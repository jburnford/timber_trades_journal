AVISS, ROBERT, trading as R. Aviss & Co., builder and contractor, Cedar Lodge, Putney Bridge Road, and trading at Baltic Wharf, Brewhouse Lane, Putney.—The adjourned meeting of the creditors took place on Monday, at the offices of the Official Receiver, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E., under the presidency of the Senior Official Receiver, Mr. Mackintosh. The particulars have already been published in the Journal. The debtor said that if the creditors would adjourn the meeting for another two months he thought he should then be able to lay a definite proposal before them for the payment of the debts in full. Mr. R. J. Ward said that since he had been appointed special manager of the estate the business had paid its way, so that the estate was in practically the same state as it was when debtor filed his petition in July last. Mr. Stanley Evans, who appeared for a creditor, said he must oppose a further adjournment. If the debtor intended to bring forward a proposal he had been allowed ample time. Mr. Brady, solicitor, who appeared for the debtor, said the reason they had not been able to make much progress since the last meeting was because the debtor had not been able to raise the survey fee. He had received a letter from a firm of solicitors that day stating that they had £20,000 ready to advance on the property if the survey proved satisfactory. The Official Receiver stated that until a week ago there was absolutely nothing done in the matter, and he did not think it fair to the creditors to bring them there, practically for nothing at all. If the meeting was again adjourned there would be additional expenses incurred. After a long discussion, Mr. Stanley Evans proposed that the debtor be adjudicated bankrupt, and that Mr. R. J. Ward, chartered accountant, Clement's Inn, W.C., be appointed trustee of the estate. That proposition was seconded by Mr. Wiggins. As an amendment, Mr. Sidney Williams Lee proposed that the meeting be adjourned until December 20th for the purpose of enabling the debtor to complete arrangements for making a satisfactory proposal to his creditors, the debtor to pay the costs of the adjournment. The amendment was seconded by Mr. John Charles Radford, and eventually the amendment was carried by a large majority in value. A resolution was afterwards passed that Mr. R. J. Ward continue as special manager for the estate until the date of the next meeting of creditors.
BRYETT, JAMES H., builder, 313, Romford Road, E.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Giffard last week, and upon the application of Messrs. Rising & Ravenscroft a receiving order was made under a creditor's petition. In reply to questions the debtor estimated his liabilities at about £2,000, and had no assets except some equities of redemption.
BUCKLAND, WM., builder and contractor, Plashet Grove, East Ham, E.—The bankrupt, trading as Benjamin John Buckland, attended for his public examination on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The accounts showed unsecured debts £1,262 11s. 5d., and assets £47 17s. 8d. It was stated that the accounts required amendment, and an adjournment was ordered for that purpose.
CARRUTHERS & HOCKING, builders and merchants, 5, Mitre Street, Aldgate, E.C.—The debtors, trading as Carruthers & Co., filed their own petition, and the first statutory meeting was held before Mr. G. Wreford, Official Receiver. The debtors commenced business in June, 1894, with a capital of £300, provided by Mr. Hocking, and they ascribe their failure to having embarked on building operations without sufficient capital or experience. Their accounts showed unsecured debts, £564 4s. 6d.; fully secured, £300; and preferential claims, £15 10s. 6d. Assets, £121 8s. 11d.; deficiency, £458 6s. 1d. The following appeared as creditors :—
£ s. d.
Harris, Walter, Bow Bridge, E. .. .. 14 17 0
Palfreman, Foster, & Co., Old Broad Street, E.C. .. .. .. .. .. 30 8 10
Vigers Bros., King William Street, E.C. 27 1 9
Mr. Street attended the meeting on behalf of the creditors, and Mr. J. R. Pakeman represented the debtors. No proposal was submitted, and bankruptcy was accordingly resolved upon. Mr. Edward Hobbs, accountant, Jewry House, Old Jewry, E.C., was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Richard Crawford, Mr. Hocking, and Mr. G. W. Abbott. The public examination is fixed for November 6th.
COX, LEONARD A., builder, trading as Meshach Cox & Son, Rodborough, near Stroud.—The public examination of this debtor was held at the Gloucester Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week. The statement of affairs disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £316 6s. 2d., and the deficiency was returned at £222 6s. 2d. The debtor stated that he had been carrying on business for the past six years on his own account, and previously to that he was in partnership with his father, Mr. Meshach Cox. He was never in his billheads, and he used his father's name without consulting his father.—Mr. Niblet, a creditor, asked for an adjournment in order that he might have time to investigate the matter more thoroughly. The Official Receiver, in supporting the application, said there was a good deal at the bottom that required sifting.—Mr. Clutterbuck, who appeared for the debtor, opposed the examination being adjourned, but the Registrar decided to let the matter stand over until the next Court. At the first meeting of creditors, held last week, it was resolved to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver.
FIDELL & SON, timber merchants, Gainsborough.—At Lincoln Bankruptcy Court, on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Stephen, the public examination took place of Jabez Fidell, Edwin Fidell, and Emma Fidell, trading as Fidell & Son, timber merchants, of Gainsborough. The gross liabilities were returned as £1,832, of which £1,803 was expected to rank for dividend, and the assets were put down as £1,075, leaving a deficiency of £728.—In reply to the Official Receiver, the senior partner said he carried on the business with his brother and his mother, under a deed of partnership dated 1889, as timber merchants and saw-mill proprietors. He valued the machinery at £750 if the affair was sold as a going concern.—Edwin Fidell agreed with his brother's examination, and as Mrs. Fidell was too ill to appear, the examination was closed.
FRETWELL, JOHN, builder, 61, The Broadway, Crouch End, N.—The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held last week before Mr. Howell, Assistant Receiver. Accounts were furnished showing total liabilities £1,648 15s., of which £900 is fully secured, and £637 15s. expected to rank, the assets being estimated to realise £187, after deducting £26 for preferential payments.

The debtor states that he commenced business in 1881, without capital, at Wood Green, subsequently removing to Crouch End, and about October or November, 1894, he entered into a private arrangement for the payment of 10s. in the pound to his creditors by instalments at three, six, nine, and twelve months, of which three have been paid. He attributes his failure to the Imperial Property Investment Company giving up building, to the want of work through the consequent upon the payment of the above-mentioned composition, and law costs. He now made no proposal, and his affairs were left in the hands of the Official Receiver to be wound up in bankruptcy under an order for summary administration made by the Court.
