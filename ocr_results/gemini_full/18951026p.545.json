  "text": "OCTOBER 26, 1895.\n\nSAILORS' INSTITUTE BUILDINGS.\nThe buildings, which have been in erection for the past fifteen months, are near completion.\nThe expense of the building amounts in all to about £10,000.\nThe building consists of three storeys and an attic, and a centre block, with principal entrances from Mearns Street.\nThe style of architecture is Renaissance.\nThe ground floor is composed of eight granite piers with large plate-glass windows and form-ing an arcade.\nAbove the cornice which surmounts the piers at each side is a fluted column, and in the centre an overhanging oriel window, the intermediate spaces being filled with three light windows.\nThis arrangement is carried up two floors, finished with an ornamental parapet, and the bay windows flanked with scrolls, and crowned by a shell cut in the stone.\nThe whole of the front is composed of the finest white Kemnay granite, and a special feature is the tower which will be seen from almost any part of the whole.\nThe chief entrance leads to a large hall.\nThe Mearns Street elevation are the reading-room, with a large oriel window, and the library, with a three-light window.\nIt contains also billiard and smoke rooms, bank and shipping offices, and keeper's apartments on the ground floor.\nOn the upper floor a large hall to accommodate 250, a chapel for 100, with retiring-rooms and a lavatory.\nOn the second floor, twelve sailors' bedrooms, and on the third floor two large dormitories for wrecked crews.\nAmple lavatory and bath accommodation is pro-vided.\nThe fittings are of the most modern description.\nThe large rooms are heated by hot water pipes.\nThe various contractors who have carried out the work have supplied the various articles as follows:—Milne & Sons; carpen-ters; Alex. Adam & Stephen & Co.; plumbers, &c.; Gordon & Co.; furnishings, Pratt & Ogilvie, and J. Allan & Sons.\nThe buildings have been designed and carried out by Mr. Jas. Souttar, architect, Aberdeen.\n\nAt a recent meeting of the Caithness County Roads Board, the construction of seven new roads was agreed to.\nArrangements are now com-pleted for proceeding with new piers at Berwick Head and Duncansbay, and it is intended to apply for a Government grant to construct a light railway from Wick to John o' Groats.\n\nThe Peterhead Burgh Commission have had before them a report by Mr. Wilson, C.E. of Edinburgh, on the town's water supply.\nThe report pointed out that as the result of three months' continuous pumping, day and night, a sufficient supply of water from the wells from which the public supply is obtained had not been established.\nIt had been proved by borings that a sufficient quantity of water could be got from the gravel bed into which the wells had been sunk.\nThe Com-mission would require to consider whether it would be advisable to go in for a filtering scheme, and after its completion to abandon the pumping altogether.\nAfter discussion, the Commission, in accordance with the recommendation of the Water Com-mittee, resolved by a majority of ten to eight to approve of the report.\n\nPrice, carriage paid, 8s.\nSCANDINAVIA, mounted on cloth and rollers, and varnished.\nThe map is coloured in counties, and shows all the Ports in Baltic, Gulf of Bothnia, Gulf of Finland, and part of White Sea.\n\nIn Sheet, price 6d. post free.\nAND CALLIPER MEASURE OF TIMBER AND DEALS.\nBy J.
