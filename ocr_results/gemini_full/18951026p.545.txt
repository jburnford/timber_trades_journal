OCTOBER 26, 1895.

SAILORS' INSTITUTE BUILDINGS.
The buildings, which have been in erection for the past fifteen months, are near completion.
The expense of the building amounts in all to about £10,000.
The building consists of three storeys and an attic, and a centre block, with principal entrances from Mearns Street.
The style of architecture is Renaissance.
The ground floor is composed of eight granite piers with large plate-glass windows and form-ing an arcade.
Above the cornice which surmounts the piers at each side is a fluted column, and in the centre an overhanging oriel window, the intermediate spaces being filled with three light windows.
This arrangement is carried up two floors, finished with an ornamental parapet, and the bay windows flanked with scrolls, and crowned by a shell cut in the stone.
The whole of the front is composed of the finest white Kemnay granite, and a special feature is the tower which will be seen from almost any part of the whole.
The chief entrance leads to a large hall.
The Mearns Street elevation are the reading-room, with a large oriel window, and the library, with a three-light window.
It contains also billiard and smoke rooms, bank and shipping offices, and keeper's apartments on the ground floor.
On the upper floor a large hall to accommodate 250, a chapel for 100, with retiring-rooms and a lavatory.
On the second floor, twelve sailors' bedrooms, and on the third floor two large dormitories for wrecked crews.
Ample lavatory and bath accommodation is pro-vided.
The fittings are of the most modern description.
The large rooms are heated by hot water pipes.
The various contractors who have carried out the work have supplied the various articles as follows:—Milne & Sons; carpen-ters; Alex. Adam & Stephen & Co.; plumbers, &c.; Gordon & Co.; furnishings, Pratt & Ogilvie, and J. Allan & Sons.
The buildings have been designed and carried out by Mr. Jas. Souttar, architect, Aberdeen.

At a recent meeting of the Caithness County Roads Board, the construction of seven new roads was agreed to.
Arrangements are now com-pleted for proceeding with new piers at Berwick Head and Duncansbay, and it is intended to apply for a Government grant to construct a light railway from Wick to John o' Groats.

The Peterhead Burgh Commission have had before them a report by Mr. Wilson, C.E. of Edinburgh, on the town's water supply.
The report pointed out that as the result of three months' continuous pumping, day and night, a sufficient supply of water from the wells from which the public supply is obtained had not been established.
It had been proved by borings that a sufficient quantity of water could be got from the gravel bed into which the wells had been sunk.
The Com-mission would require to consider whether it would be advisable to go in for a filtering scheme, and after its completion to abandon the pumping altogether.
After discussion, the Commission, in accordance with the recommendation of the Water Com-mittee, resolved by a majority of ten to eight to approve of the report.
