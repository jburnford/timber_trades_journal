The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £1,067 8s. 6d., of which £648 2s. 10d. was expected to rank against the estate for dividend. The net assets were estimated to produce £291 4s. 2d., thus leaving a deficiency of £395 18s. 8d. The Official Receiver said the assets consisted of balance due on contracts, £251; stock-in-trade, trade fixtures, &c., £252 8s. 11d.; book debts, good, £55. The debtor, at his preliminary examination, stated that his assets were considerably under £300 in value, consequently an order for the summary administration of the estate had been obtained. His statement of affairs now showed an entirely\n\ndifferent state of things, and for the first time they heard of an estimated balance on contracts. The debtor now admitted that he had over-estimated the value of his assets. Eventually the estate was left in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.\nBAXTER, THOMAS, wheelwright, Clare Road, Forest Gate, E.—At a sitting held on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard, the bankrupt passed his public examination. The statement of affairs showed liabilities £337 16s. 8d., and a deficiency of £139. It appeared that he had traded for seventeen years, and that his failure was due to an accident which incapacitated him from attending to business for about three months.\nBUCKLAND, WM. (trading as Buckland & Co., and J. Buckland), builder, Plashet Grove, East Ham, E.—Particulars of this failure have already appeared in the Timber Trades Journal. On Wednesday the bankrupt passed his public examination before Mr. Registrar Giffard, an amended statement of affairs having been filed showing liabilities £1,337 16s. 8d., and assets £50. The failure was stated to be attributable to losses on various building contracts undertaken by the bankrupt during the past five years in the East End of London.\nCLARK, JUNIOR, RICHARD B., builder, Grove Road, Chichester.—Mr. A. S. W. Cox, Official Receiver at Brighton, has issued his report to the creditors herein. The liabilities are gross, £6,492 5s. 2d., of which £1,834 16s. 7d. is due to unsecured creditors to rank for dividend. The assets are estimated at £915 19s. 11d., deficiency £918 16s. 8d. The alleged causes of failure are illness of self, heavy interest, and expenses. The Official Receiver's observations state that the debtor filed his own petition, and has been adjudicated bankrupt. He commenced business in 1887 with a capital of £35. He commenced speculative building, but he has also taken contracts which have resulted in a profit. At the date of the receiving order contracts with the County Council were pending, and these are being completed. A private meeting of creditors had been held, but as no cash offer could be made, the petition was filed. No proper books of account have been kept. Among the creditors are:—\n£ s. d.\nBailey & Son, Portsmouth .. .. .. 23 18 8\nChatfield & Son, Lewes.. .. .. .. 69 3 1\nCheeseman, A., Chichester .. .. .. 39 8 8\nCover Bros., Chichester .. .. .. 76 10 2\nClarke, R.

The gross liabilities are £3,558 13s. 4d., of which, however, only £348 13s 4d is unsecured, and the debtor estimates a surplus from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors to the amount of £550, showing, after payment of preferential claims, a surplus on the estate of £198 6s. 8d. The debtor attributes his position to “delay in completion of properties in consequence of credit being stopped and inability to let or realise the properties.” The debtor attended at the Official Receiver’s office on September 6th, but did not lodge his statement of affairs until October 17th. The debtor, who gives his present age as 22, states that at the end of 1891, at the age of 18, he commenced business at Wimbledon with £10. He has kept no books of account whatever, and has never made out a statement of assets and liabilities during the last three years. He is a married man.\nCUMING, JOHN, builder and decorator, of Hawthorne Place, Epsom, who has been adjudged a bankrupt, had his public examination at the Croydon Bankruptcy Court last week. In his statement of affairs debtor sets down his gross liabilities at £364. His assets were estimated to produce £14 13s. 11d., the deficiency amounting to £176. The examination was concluded.\nELLERY, WILLIAM ALFRED THOMAS, and ELLERY, LEOPOLD GEORGE, builders, Cardiff.—The public examination of these bankrupts was held at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court, on Friday week, before Mr. Registrar Langley. The debtor, Leopold George Ellery, stated that he had been building lately in Cardiff with his brother. Previous to that he carried on a builder’s business in Bristol, where he got into difficulties. When he left Bristol for Cardiff, two years ago, he still owed a considerable amount of money. He had not paid his Bristol creditors yet. He called his creditors together before leaving Bristol, and offered them his property, but they refused to take it, and they also declined to make him bankrupt. Since he had been in Cardiff he had built a considerable number of houses. After the other debtor had corroborated the statements made by his bro-her, the examination was declared closed.\nFIRBANK, JABEZ H., contractor, Penygraig, Brynderwen Road, Maindee; and Borough Chambers, Skinner Street, Newport (Mon.).—Under this registered deed the following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nPigott, T., & Co., Limited, Birmingham .. 383 0 0\nLysaght, J., Limited, Bristol .. .. .. 59 0 0\nSessions & Sons, Limited Gloucester .. .. 33 0 0\nButt, J.
