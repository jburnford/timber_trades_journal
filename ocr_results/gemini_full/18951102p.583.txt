ABERDEEN—HARBOUR IMPROVEMENTS.—
At a meeting of the Works Committee, on Wednesday, the Harbour Engineer reported on the dredging and works of the harbour executed during the month ending the 22nd of September.
The total quantity dredged was 18,152 tons, of which 17,880 tons were conveyed to sea by hoppers.
Work involving an expenditure of £754 2s. 11d. has been done in connection with the reconstruction of the Albert Quay wall.
The repairs to the old South Breakwater are now finished, the total cost having been £517 3s. 2d., and the estimate £300.
A sum of £91 11s. 6d. was expended during the month.
Rails and causewaying at Provost Blaikie's Quay have cost £122 2s. 9d.

BANFF HARBOUR TRUST.—A meeting of the Banff Harbour Trustees has been held in connection with the Order amending the Act, 3 and 4 Vic., relating to Banff Harbour.
This Order received the Royal assent on September 5th, as part of the "Pier and Harbour Orders Confirmation (No. 2) Act, 1895."
The Order, which was laid on the table, consists of seventeen clauses, and has, it was explained by the chairman, been in operation since the first Monday of September.
The rates on the schedule charged on articles transhipped and unshipped at the harbour, being maximum, it was considered desirable that a committee should go over the schedule and fix the rates that should be exacted.
It was finally remitted to a committee of the whole Board to do this, and to have a schedule printed and issued at the earliest, to show the maximum rate and the rate to be charged for the time.

RIVALRY BETWEEN SCOTCH HARBOURS.—
In the West of Scotland we have seen something like a spirit of keen rivalry between the harbour boards, but the struggle while it lasted was like every other kind of struggle, more productive of interest to outsiders than a source of gain to the parties more immediately concerned.
Greenock tried a fall with the Clyde Trustees as representing the attempt, but failed hopelessly to become a second St. Mungo have only proved a source of trouble and loss.
On the east coast, a smart fight has begun between Kirkcaldy and Burntisland with the object of determining which shall be first in the field with a deep-water harbour.
A well-equipped deep-water harbour is really wanted on the Fife coast, and it is surprising that neither the people of Kirkcaldy and Burntisland have not recognised this fact long ago.
Only one harbour, however, is wanted, and will have a well-earned monopoly.
Burntisland is backed up by the North British Railway Company, while Kirkcaldy has to rely solely on its enterprising manufacturers and traders.
But in spite of the undoubted strength of the railway company Kirkcaldy may be relied on to make a gallant struggle for harbour supremacy in the "kingdom of Fife."—The Shipping World.

BUILDING NEWS.
From the minutes of the Glasgow Police Board it appears that the provisional arrangement provides for the sale of the police offices to the Bazaar Committee for £27,000, and that the cost of erecting the new police offices, including £13,000 for the site, would be £39,000.

Lord Provost Dewar said at the meeting of the Perth Council that he had been much annoyed at the delay in the production of the plans for the free library.
They had now been in the hands of the architect for a very long time.
He had written asking the reason for the delay, and the architect had replied that there had been no unnecessary delay, and that time was required for elaborating the plans of such an important public building.
