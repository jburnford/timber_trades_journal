FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BADDELEY, WILLIAM HENRY, builder, in Victoria Road and Whitmore Street, Hanley. His gross liabilities were returned at £1,068 8s. 6d., of which the sum of £648 2s. 10d. was expected to rank for dividend. The assets were £252 8s. 8d. Mr. F. C. Bennett represented the petitioning creditors at the Hanley Bankruptcy Court last week. Replying to the Official Receiver, the bankrupt said he began business in Whitmore Street two years ago with a capital of £50, as a speculative builder; but a few months later he began to take contract work, and had not been successful with it. While carrying on business as a builder, he held the licence of the Mount Pleasant Inn, Tinkers-clough ; but it was his mother had the business and died, leaving his two sisters and himself £190 each. The examination was adjourned till December 12th.

BARNARD, W. R., packing-case maker, 33, Fann Street, E C.—The debtor has presented his petition, and on Saturday, upon the application of Messrs. G. B. Brown & Co., the usual receiving order was made. The debtor states that he resides in apartments in King's Square, Goswell Road, and the furniture belongs to his wife. His assets, consisting of stock, book debts, &c., were valued at about £100, the amount of the liabilities not being stated.

BELCH, EDWIN, builder, of Viewsley, Hillingdon East, Middlesex.—Mr. Cecil Mercer, Official Receiver for the Windsor district, on Saturday issued particulars of this failure. The gross liabilities are £4,136, of which £2,170 17s. 7d is expected to rank against the estate for dividend. The assets are £845 15s. 9d., leaving a deficiency of £1,325 1s. 10d. The receiving order was made on October 17th on the debtor's own petition, and on October 21st the debtor was adjudged bankrupt. He states that in 1863 he commenced business at Viewsley as a builder, without capital. This business was carried on alone up to 1877, when he built certain property, to which premises, and which he opened as a grocer and draper. He does not appear, however, to have taken any active part in the shop, this having been left to the debtor's wife and daughters, the debtor having been left to the building operations. The debtor states that he has only kept a "builder's book" and a ledger showing the amounts owing to the estate by his debtors. No cash-book has been kept or any record of his receipts and payments. There is, therefore, little or no material for ascertaining what business has been done or a true position of the debtor's affairs.
