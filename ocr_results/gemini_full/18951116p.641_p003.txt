FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debt, sometimes for the full amount.]
ALLEN, A. H., coachbuilder, 164 and 351, Cambridge Road, E. The debtor has presented his petition, and on Monday, upon the application of Mr. R. White, a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Giffard. The lease of 164, Cambridge Road was stated to be charged, and the value of the plant, timber, &c., on the premises was not estimated. At 351, Cambridge Road, and had also a workshop there, the stock, furniture, &c., being valued at about £90. The book debts were of small amount, and there was no cash in hand. The amount of liabilities was not stated.
BACKHOUSE, FRANCIS BLYTH, builder and contractor, Goole.—The public examination of this debtor was held at the Wakefield Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week, before Mr. Registrar Mason. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £13,600 15s. 10d., of which £3,741 2s. 5d., was expected to rank against the estate for dividend. The assets were returned at £856 6s. 5d. thus leaving a deficiency of £2,884 10s. The debtor, in reply to questions put by the Official Receiver, stated that his failure had been caused through the depreciation in the value of property, loss on contracts, and bank charges. He commenced business in Goole about eleven years ago, having at the time about £230 in stock and money. He had gone in principally for speculative building, and he had been mainly financed by his bankers, to whom he now owed upwards of £8,000. The debtor was eventually allowed to pass his examination.
BADDELEY, WILLIAM HENRY, builder, Victoria Road, and Whitmore Street, Hanley.—The public examination of this debtor was held at the Hanley Bankruptcy Court, on Friday last week, before Mr. Registrar Tennant. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £1,068 8s. 6d., of which sum £648 2s. 10d. was expected to rank against the estate for dividend; the assets were estimated to produce £395 14s. 2d., thus showing a deficiency of £252 8s. 8d. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he began business in Whitmore Street, Hanley, about two years ago, with a capital of £50. At first he went in for speculative building, and as he made money he went in for contract work, but unfortunately he had not been successful in that respect. Finally it was resolved to adjourn the examination until December 12th.
BELCH, EDWIN, builder and grocer, Viewsley, Hillingdon, near Uxbridge. — The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this failure was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Temple Chambers, E.C., on Thursday week, under the presidency of the Assistant Official Receiver, Mr. Shirtcliffe. Particulars were given in last week's Journal. It was decided to appoint Mr. Lovell Hurt, chartered accountant, 110, Cannon Street, E.C., as trustee, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection, consisting of three creditors.
BOOTH, A., timber merchant, Hoxton, N., trading as the London Box and Packing-case Company.—The bankrupt, who had also traded as a grocer, applied last week to Mr. Registrar Giffard for his discharge. The failure occurred in May last, the unsecured liabilities being returned at £5,055 1s. 7d., and the assets at £9,130 17s. 3d., but it was not expected that they would realise more than £2,350 at the utmost. It appears that the bankrupt, having traded successfully for many years as a grocer, was between 1881 and 1883 possessed of property of the estimated value of about £20,000. About that time he built and fitted up premises on land at the rear of his grocery shop at Hoxton for the purpose of a saw-mill at a total expense of about £7,000, and he attributed his failure mainly to losses and liabilities incurred in respect of the saw-mill. The Official Receiver reported that the

bankrupt had traded after knowing himself to be insolvent; also, in connection with the undertaking, that he had brought on or contributed to his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation. A further charge was made that the bankrupt had given an undue preference to his solicitors by making them a payment of £50 shortly before his failure, but rebutting evidence having been given, the Registrar held that the charge fell to the ground. His Honour was of opinion, however, that the bankrupt had traded after knowledge of insolvency, and that he had been rash in running two different businesses. He therefore suspended the order of discharge for two years and six months.
COLLIER, G. V., builder and contractor, Balham, S.W.—This failure occurred in June, 1891, and the bankrupt applied last week to Mr. Registrar Giffard for an order of discharge. The unsecured liabilities amounted to £2,488 10s. 4d., and the assets were returned at £6s. 4d. The bankrupt had for many years prior to the failure carried on business in various parts of London and the suburbs. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt had traded with knowledge of insolvency, and had embarked in rash and hazardous speculations. His Honour, taking into consideration the length of time that had elapsed since the failure, granted discharge subject to a further suspension of two years.
DAVIES, GRIFFITH, builder and contractor, 36, Pemberton Street, Llanelly.—Under this bankruptcy proceeding the following are creditors:—
Brown, Thomas, & Johns, Llanelly ... £4 4 4
Davies, John, Llanelly ... ... 26 13 0
David, Llanelly ... ... 200 0 0
ELLIS, W. T., builder, 144, Cambridge Road, E.—The debtor has filed his petition, and on Tuesday the usual receiving order was made. The assets were estimated at about £10 only, in addition to a trifling amount of book debts. The debtor stated that he had a contract for £500, on which he had laid out about £700, but having made default the owner had taken possession and was now completing the work.
FISHER, HARRY, builder, Eastwood Lodge, Rayleigh, Essex.—The public examination of the above-named bankrupt took place at the Chelmsford Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Duffield, on the 7th inst. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £1,102, and the assets was returned at £206 12s. 3d. A few questions were asked by the creditors, and the examination was adjourned.
FREWELL, JOHN, builder, 61, The Broadway, Crouch End, N.—The bankrupt came up for his public examination last week before Mr. Registrar Hope. He states that he commenced business in 1881 at Wood Green without any capital. He was in difficulties last year, and then arranged to pay a composition of 10s. in the pound, by four instalments, which was not yet due, but payment of which was guaranteed. He attributed his appearance before the Court to having agreed to pay too large a composition, thereby crippling his business. His unsecured debts amounted to £691, and his assets, valued at £180, consisted chiefly of book debts, which he thought were recoverable, although some of them were disputed. The books of account were imperfect. He had been insolvent since 1892. The examination was concluded.
GILBERTTHORPE, FREDERICK, builder, 101, Rock Street, Sheffield.—The meeting of creditors of this debtor was held at the office of the Official Receiver yesterday week. The summary of the debtor's statement of affairs showed liabilities to unsecured creditors of
