  "text": "NOVEMBER 16, 1895.\nGALLOWGATE, Glasgow.\n\nAN EDINBURGH BRIDGE.\nThe Lord Provost's Committee of the Town Council have considered a letter from the general manager of the North British Railway Company, stating that the directors would offer no objection to the erection of a cart-traffic bridge from Low Calton to Jeffrey Street, subject to certain specified conditions being complied with. In the course of the discussion it was stated that the bridge would cost about £30,000, exclusive of the price of certain property at one or other end which the Corporation might have to acquire, and that they would have a sum of £5,000, the Corporation were required to pay to them under the Waverley Bridge Act towards the construction of a foot-bridge. In the end the Committee agreed to purchase the ground. A conference has been held between the Edinburgh Street Tramways Company and a deputation, including Provost Brand, of the Portobello Town Council, with reference to the extension of the Portobello section of the line as far as the burgh boundary at Joppa, and the Provost agreed to bring the subject up at the next meeting, or a special meeting if necessary, of the Town Council.\n\nEDINBURGH.—A contract has been entered into by the Edinburgh and Leith Gas Commissioners with Messrs. Robert Bruce & Sons, Greenside Place, for the construction of the new chimney at the New Street works. The chimney, which is to be erected at the extreme southern boundary of the works, will be 250 ft. in height from the ground level, with 23 ft. of a foundation. It will rest upon a bed of concrete, 32 ft. square and 6 ft. 6 in. in thickness, and at the base, where the stalk will be 11 ft. in diameter, the ring will have a thickness of three and a half bricks, gradually tapering until at the top the thickness is reduced to one and a half bricks. The contract provides for the chimney being faced with terracotta brick, with stone bands at intervals, and for the top being of an ornamental nature, with a panelled arcading in stone or in buff brick. It is expected that the chimney will be completed in six weeks from the time work is commenced, which will be almost immediately. The cost of the chimney will amount to £3,490.\n\nBLUE CLAY AS A FOUNDATION.—In the operations connected with the erection of the new post-office buildings in Dundee, says the *Building World*, the construction of the foundations presented no little difficulty owing to the ground being formed of blue clay. Piling the ground, which had been resorted to in other cases in the neighbourhood, was not adopted here, but the blue clay was cut through until boulder clay was met with. Upon this walls of concrete, 10 ft. in depth and very thick, were set, and square pillars of concrete reared above these to carry the walls. The pillar arrangement was chosen to give light to the lower apartments. A different treatment of the blue clay was employed in the building of the new offices of the Prudential Insurance Company adjoining. Here a good deal of vibration was observed, caused by the passing and repassing of the steam cars, and to overcome this it was decided to construct a substantial wall as a foundation for the front of the building. This wall is 5 ft. thick, and carried down to the boulder clay. At a depth of 9 ft. below the surface of the ground a concrete raft or bed 4 ft. in thickness was laid upon the will, it is supposed, being incompressible, will, and this bed at the same time will form the floor of the basement.\n\nFLOORING CALCULATOR.
