AN EDINBURGH BRIDGE.
The Lord Provost's Committee of the Town Council have considered a letter from the general manager of the North British Railway Company, stating that the directors would offer no objection to the erection of a cart-traffic bridge from Low Calton to Jeffrey Street, subject to certain specified conditions being complied with. In the course of the discussion it was stated that the bridge would cost about £30,000, exclusive of the price of certain property at one or other end which the Corporation might have to acquire, and that they would have a sum of £5,000, the Corporation were required to pay to them under the Waverley Bridge Act towards the construction of a foot-bridge. In the end the Committee agreed to purchase the ground. A conference has been held between the Edinburgh Street Tramways Company and a deputation, including Provost Brand, of the Portobello Town Council, with reference to the extension of the Portobello section of the line as far as the burgh boundary at Joppa, and the Provost agreed to bring the subject up at the next meeting, or a special meeting if necessary, of the Town Council.

EDINBURGH.—A contract has been entered into by the Edinburgh and Leith Gas Commissioners with Messrs. Robert Bruce & Sons, Greenside Place, for the construction of the new chimney at the New Street works. The chimney, which is to be erected at the extreme southern boundary of the works, will be 250 ft. in height from the ground level, with 23 ft. of a foundation. It will rest upon a bed of concrete, 32 ft. square and 6 ft. 6 in. in thickness, and at the base, where the stalk will be 11 ft. in diameter, the ring will have a thickness of three and a half bricks, gradually tapering until at the top the thickness is reduced to one and a half bricks. The contract provides for the chimney being faced with terracotta brick, with stone bands at intervals, and for the top being of an ornamental nature, with a panelled arcading in stone or in buff brick. It is expected that the chimney will be completed in six weeks from the time work is commenced, which will be almost immediately. The cost of the chimney will amount to £3,490.

BLUE CLAY AS A FOUNDATION.—In the operations connected with the erection of the new post-office buildings in Dundee, says the *Building World*, the construction of the foundations presented no little difficulty owing to the ground being formed of blue clay. Piling the ground, which had been resorted to in other cases in the neighbourhood, was not adopted here, but the blue clay was cut through until boulder clay was met with. Upon this walls of concrete, 10 ft. in depth and very thick, were set, and square pillars of concrete reared above these to carry the walls. The pillar arrangement was chosen to give light to the lower apartments. A different treatment of the blue clay was employed in the building of the new offices of the Prudential Insurance Company adjoining. Here a good deal of vibration was observed, caused by the passing and repassing of the steam cars, and to overcome this it was decided to construct a substantial wall as a foundation for the front of the building. This wall is 5 ft. thick, and carried down to the boulder clay. At a depth of 9 ft. below the surface of the ground a concrete raft or bed 4 ft. in thickness was laid upon the will, it is supposed, being incompressible, will, and this bed at the same time will form the floor of the basement.

BUILDING NEWS.
The next half-yearly meeting of the Scottish Building Trades Federation will be held at Glasgow.

The directors of the Glasgow and South Western Railway have approved the plans for alterations at the station at Mauchline, Ayr.

It has been decided to build a new school at Greetland to accommodate 425 children, but no site has been definitely decided upon up to the present.

A deputation from the Edinburgh Town Council has visited Glasgow, and inspected the dwellings erected by the Corporation Improvement Trust for the accommodation of the poorer classes.

The Dundee Harbour Board have agreed to grant the request of Mr. J. R. Findlay, burgh surveyor, for permission to lay a 6 in. water-pipe across the bed of the river about 60 yards above the Suspension Bridge to Rossie Island.

Mr. Malcolm Stark has read a paper before the Glasgow Architectural Association on “Asylum Planning,” in which he discussed the many and varied requirements necessary to be considered in the designing of such institutions.

A new convalescent house for female patients, erected at Murthly Asylum, was formally opened by Lord Balvaird early this month. A building is also in course of erection for males, and the two are estimated to cost £9,000. The plans have been prepared by Mr. David Smart, Perth.

The Stevenston (Ayr) School Board have adopted plans for an extension to the public school, which is at present overcrowded. The proposed extension, costing £500, will form a wing at the rear of the school and give accommodation for 130 scholars, with a kitchen for lessons in cookery.

St. John’s Roman Catholic Church, Port Glasgow, was formally opened last week, after being partially rebuilt. The church is designed in the Early Decorated style, and consists of nave, chancel, transepts, side chapel, baptistery, sacristies, &c. The new altar, which is one of the finest in Scotland, cost £500, and the total cost of the reconstruction was £6,000.

It has been decided to increase the sitting capacity of Skelmorlie U.P. Church, and at a meeting of the congregation plans prepared by Mr. Leiper, architect, Glasgow, were submitted and adopted. The plans show an extension consisting of a new transept to the east and a new chancel to the north, the probable cost being over £2,500. The whole interior of the church is to be re-arranged. The extension will add some 120 new sittings to the edifice, making accommodation for over 600 worshippers in all.

The Kirk Memorial Evangelical Union Church, the foundation-stone of which has just been laid, is situated at East Montgomery Street, Edinburgh. It is designed in the Early Perpendicular style, with nave and transeptal projections. The pulpit will be placed at the junction of the west transept and choir arches. The church is to be seated for 400, and the hall below will accommodate 200 persons. Vestry, session house, and classroom accommodation is also provided for. The architect is Mr. Hippolyte J. Blanc, A.R.S.A., of Edinburgh.

UNSUITABLE STAVES FOR HERRING BARRELS.—The First Division of the Court of Session has adhered to a judgment of Lord Low, assoilzieing James Milne, fish-curer, Aberdeen, from the conclusions of an action by John H. Douglas & Co., timber merchant, London, for £125 2s. 6d., the price of a quantity of whitewood fir staves and headings. The defender refused to accept the wood, and the Court held the rejection to be right, the wood having been unsuited for the purpose intended—namely, the making of herring barrels.
