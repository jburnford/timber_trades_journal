FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BARKER, HENRY (trading as J. W. Barker & Co.), timber merchant, High Street, Leyton.—The bankrupt attended for public examination on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard, his accounts showing liabilities £1,163 12s. 7d., and assets £72 12s. 8d. He failed in June, 1894, after trading for twenty years, and attributed his bankruptcy to loss on the trading, law costs, and loss on the sale of his stock under a distress for rent. Mr. E. S. Grey attended as Assistant Receiver, and said that he had no questions to ask. Mr. Street said that he appeared for the trustee (who had obtained his release in the matter) and also for creditors, and he suggested that the result of the trustee's prosecution of the bankrupt should be recorded, so that it might be taken notice of when he applied for his discharge. His Honour concurred, and the bankrupt, in reply to Mr. Street, stated that he had been sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment for offences under the Debtors' Act. The examination was then ordered to be closed.
BARNARD, W. R., box and packing-case manufacturers, 33, Fann Street, E.C.—The debtor filed his petition on the 2nd inst., and he has now furnished a statement of affairs show-ing liabilities to unsecured creditors £1,487 9s. 1d., and assets £94 9s. 4d. He commenced business in April, 1892, at the above address, with £200 borrowed money, and states that his insolvency is attributable chiefly to losses in trade, particularly during the years 1892 and 1893. He estimates his net loss in carrying on the business at £917 19s. 9d. The liabilities include £635 for borrowed moneys, the other claims being mostly for goods supplied. The debtor has been adjudged bankrupt.

BRINDLEY, GEO., timber merchant, Park Saw-mills, Burslem.—As announced last week, a private meeting of the creditors of this debtor has been held. He proposed to pay his creditors in full, and it seems probable, judging from the statement of affairs presented to the meeting, that he will be able to do so. The assets are considerable, and an adjournment was made in order that an independent investi-gation may be made by Mr. J. H. Scott, of the Timber Trades Association. The following are the principal creditors :—

BROMLEY, W. H., builder, Corsham.—The public examination of this debtor took place at the Bath County Court on Thursday week, before Mr. Registrar Robertson. Reply-ing to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he commenced business about 24 years ago, with a capital of about £120 of his own money. His building opera-tions had been principally contracts. His unsecured liabilities amounted to £800 and his deficiency to £620, and he attributed that large deficiency to the expenses of his large family, bad trade, and to the fact that his principal customer, a large estate owner, had lately altered his system and employed his own mechanics. The reason he did not file his petition earlier was because he kept hoping that trade would improve. The examination was then ordered to be closed.
DAVIS, GRIFFITH, builder and con-tractor, 36, Pemberton Street, Llanelly.—The public examination of this debtor was held at the Carmarthen Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Parkinson, on the 14th inst. The summary of accounts filed by the bankrupt disclosed liabilities expected to rank against the estate for dividend amounting to £468 9s. 10d., and the assets were estimated to pro-duce £120 6s. 10d., thus leaving a deficiency of £345 6s. The examination was adjourned until the next Court.
DAWES, F. R., builder and carpenter, Peckham Rye, S.E.—The bankrupt applied last week to Mr. Registrar Giffard for an order of discharge. He failed in March, 1890, and his assets had realised £6 10s. only, the ranking liabilities being returned at £1,530 10s. The bankrupt, who had traded for about fifteen years, attributed his failure to losses through building speculation and on accommodation bills. In 1888 he took over a building agree-ment for the erection of seven houses at Catford, and completed the work in September, 1889, but was unable to find a purchaser, and eventually filed his petition. Trading with knowledge of insolvency, rash and hazardous speculation, and contracting debts without reasonable expectation of being able to pay them, were other offences were reported by the Official Receiver. His Honour, taking into considera-tion the long period of time which had elapsed since the failure, granted the discharge, subject to a suspension of three months.

JARVIS, WILLIAM HENRY BAR-NETT, timber merchant and tinplate box cutter, of Grove, Wantage, and the South Docks, Swansea.—The debtor said, at the Oxford Bankruptcy Court last week, he filed his petition through Thomas & Co.'s (Swansea) transac-tions with him, and through Mr. Moxham, timber merchant, Swansea, putting in an execu-tion, and he did it for the benefit of the other creditors. The reason he had not obeyed the order of the Court to furnish an account of his affairs with Thomas & Co. from September, 1894, to September, 1895, was that he did not under-stand exactly what to do. The Registrar said he would give him time to comply with the order of the Court, and if it was not done a week before December 12th he should send him before the Judge for contempt. The Official Receiver told debtor he could have all his books and
