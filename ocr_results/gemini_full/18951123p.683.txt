For some time past the necessity for an
isolation hospital has been fully recognised
by the Local Authority of Oban. They have
had plans prepared; and these have been
approved by the Local Government Board
for Scotland. The plans show a building
to consist of a central or administrative
block, and one pavilion (two wards), with
accommodation for six beds in all, the
remaining pavilion to be erected at a later
date, and the estimated cost is about £1,000.
Dr. Mackelvie has now made a gift to the
burgh of £1,000, unfettered by
any conditions or stipulations further than
that during the doctor’s lifetime he receives
3 per cent. as interest on the capital, and he
reserves to himself the right of expending
this interest on the building, either in its
extension or upon its improvement in any
way that may seem to him best.

Large improvements have been going on
for a number of years on His Grace the
Duke of Richmond and Gordon’s estates
round Cairnie, in the way of buildings.
Among these are a new mill, with stable, lofting,
power threshing mill, with sleeping
accommodation, at Cairn-
whelp (locally pronounced Cairnfoulp).
These, with the new dwelling-house pre-
viously up, form prominent features in the
landscape, the site being 650 ft. high. At
Een, at an elevation of some 670 ft., a nice
threshing-mill for horse driving is also up,
with men’s sleeping room, girnal apartment,
and grain loft. The masons were Messrs.
Imlach & Son, Grantown. The largest build-
ings, however, are at Smallburn, Mr.
Morrison’s, where a large place is erected for
power threshing mill, stables, cart, gig, and
hay sheds, men’s sleeping rooms, and potato
cellar.

The erection of the new school in Walker
Road, Torry, Aberdeen, for which Messrs.
Ellis & Wilson are architects, is being carried
on with great energy, and the building is
already a conspicuous object in the locality.
The contractor for the mason work, Mr.
George Hall, commenced operations in June,
and with the aid of a large staff of men he
has now completed the heaviest part of his
work. The walls have been raised to the
height of two flats, and only the third floor
remains to be added. The building is
almost ready for roofing by
the New Year. By the use of iron beams
the floors are supported without the intro-
duction of numerous inside walls, and in such
walls as are required shafts are being pro-
vided for the system of mechanical ventila-
tion which is to be employed in the school.
The building occupies a splendid site, and
