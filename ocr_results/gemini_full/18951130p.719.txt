ENGLISH ARBORICUL-
TURAL SOCIETY.

A meeting of the council of the English Arboricultural Society was held at the Westminster Hotel on Saturday afternoon.
Dr. Somerville moved that action be taken with regard to candidates in forestry, and that the society grant certificates of forestry to successful candidates satisfying the examiners, and that a committee of the council be appointed to go fully into the matter and report.
Mr. G. Marshall said it was a reflection on the society that the newly-formed County Council of Northumberland should take up a question like this when the society had been in existence much longer than the County Council.
He thought the County Council clearly showed that such examinations were a necessity, and that it should have been the society's duty to take the matter into its own hand, and not leave it to be taken up by the County Council.
Dr. Somerville said, We forget that we haven't got the sinews of war at our back, which the Northumberland County Council has.
Mr. W. Fell: That is where the great difficulty comes in.
The motion was agreed to, and the following members were appointed a committee for the purposes mentioned:—Mr. John Maughan, Mr. W. G. Gallie, Mr. John Wilson, Mr. G. Clark, and Dr. Somerville (convener).
The council resolved that the annual meeting for 1896 be to Chester and district, visiting Eaton Hall and Hawarden.
A gold medal was awarded to Mr. John Oazes, Park, Newcastle, for an essay on the influence of situation and soil on the growth and sylvicultural treatment of trees, and on the quality of the timber; a bronze medal to Mr. William Forbes, Swinton, for an essay on the pine saw fly; and a silver medal to Mr. R. Robinson, Castle Eden, Durham, for an essay on the felling, trans-port, and conversion of British timber, with the cost of the different methods.

A large portion of the new south wall at Ayr is completed.
It seems a substantial work, and is faced with fenders at every interval of 25 ft., while the berths will have a depth of from 16 to 18 ft. at low water.
The lower berth will be most suitable for the steamer traffic in the summer.

GREENOCK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.—At the monthly meeting of Greenock Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, Messrs. C. H. Curtis and Mr. D. M'Gillivray (shipowners) were appointed the representatives of the Chamber on the Clyde Lighthouse Trust.
Reference was made to the completion of the deepening of the channel in the river, and on the sug-gestion of Mr. A. O. Leitch it was agreed to recommend to the representatives to propose that the new channel should be named after Mr. Hender-son, the late chairman of the Trust, on account of the great interest he took in the work.
It was unanimously agreed that a meeting at the port of Greenock to express dissatisfaction with the new Clyde Trust rates for river and harbour dues was out of place, and that the best way to proceed was to get the various grain cargoes arriving at the port of Greenock, in the absence of any express stipulations to the contrary in the charter-parties or bills of lading, it be deemed to be the custom of the port that (a) the entire cost of discharging same on ship's deck or rail be borne by the ship; (b) in the event of con-signees requiring grain in bags to be "skipped," or grain in bulk to be bagged in the ship's hold, all cost of doing so to be paid by them; (c) should grain or seed be raised from the ship's hold by dockside cranes, or other shore appliances, and landed direct on verandah floors, or into railway trucks alongside ship, the extra cost beyond the "hold-to-deck" cost was to be borne by consignees; (d) cost of weighing on ship's deck or ashore to be wholly paid by consignees.

BUILDING NEWS.

The Rothesay Harbour Trust have decided to extend the pier westward at a cost of £7,860.
The extension will be 250 ft. long by 50 ft. wide.

A proposal of the Aberdeen School Board to construct swimming-baths, at a cost of £2,000, has been referred back to committee.
It is proposed to municipalise the tramways.
Electric traction is projected.

In reference to a suitable site for an hospital for infectious diseases at North Berwick, Sir Walter Hamilton Dalrymple has offered to give a site at the westernmost field of the Newhouse Road.

The Arbroath Burgh Commissioners have resolved to extend the underground water supply of the town by sinking a new well in the lands of Warslap, and connecting it by means of an adit passing through the water-bearing gravel bed with the wells and pump-ing station at Nolt Loan.
The adit connect-ing the wells will be about a quarter of a mile long.
It was resolved to engage the services of Mr. M'Culloch, C.E., Dundee, to advise the Board in the carrying out of the work.

A new public hall has been erected at Pitaligo, the work having been satisfactorily performed by the following firms:—James Smith, New Pitaligo; mason work, William Wallace, New Pitaligo; carpenter work, M'Intosh & Connon, Peter-head; plasterer, Alexander Craig, New Pitaligo; plumbers, Ross & Swinney, Aber-deen; and glazier and painter work, James Stuart, Fraserburgh.

At a conference between the Leith Cor-poration and representatives of the Edinburgh Street Tramways Company, it is understood consent was given by the Corporation to the proposed extensions of the tramway lines from the Bernard Street terminus to the terminus near the Custom House, and from the west end of Commercial Street to the present Newhaven terminus.
The Public Parks Committee recommend the Council to authorise the construction of a pond on the Links.
Mr. Beatson, burgh surveyor, reported that he estimated the construction of a pond of about three acres in extent at £950.

With a view to the opening up for building purposes of various sites in the Edinburgh district of which the Heriot Trustees are the superiors, the feus of a number of building lots have been disposed of by auction.
Ground at Wester Coates, fronting the new streets being opened up in that district, was sold at the rate of £50 per acre of feu-duty; six out of twenty-three building lots in Denham Green, Trinity, on which are to be erected two-story terrace houses, were sold at the upset of £5 feu-duty per lot, and four lots in Carson Street, Leith Walk, and intended for the erection of four-story houses, were disposed of at the upset price of 10s. 6d. per foot of frontage feu-duty.

The first of a series of meetings in con-nection with the Building Trades' Exchange of the city and district of Glasgow has been held at 30, Gordon Street, when Mr. John Keppie, of Messrs. John Honeyman & Keppie, architects, read a paper entitled "A Résumé of the Work of the Building Trades' Exchange, with some Notes on Measuring."
Mr. Keppie gave a summary of the work the Exchange had done during the past year, and indicated new developments which were intended to take place during the coming year.
He called special attention to the sample depart-ment, which had already proved a boon, and which, were it enlarged and supplemented, might ultimately supersede the industrial exhibitions which take place over the country from time to time.
The formation of a library of catalogues properly arranged and easy of access was also considered, and the directorate of the exchange were agreeable that this suggestion should be carried out.
The fact that all members were responsible to the directorate for the probity of their practice and for con-formity to specifications, if membership were to continue, was also dwelt on; also the settlement of disputes between contracting parties without the trouble and expense of litigation and by those who from their posi-tion had the practical knowledge necessary for such settlements, was considered a favourable feature.
