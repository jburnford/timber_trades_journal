It is a native of Bengal and is largely cultivated, possessing the advantage of thriving in dry, stony ground or in any manner of soil, from the sea level up to 3,000 ft. altitude, and no outlay is required in its cultivation. The flowers are produced in enormous quantities in March and April, and contain 50 per cent. of sugar; they are used largely as a nutritious and wholesome food by men, cattle, pigs, wild animals, birds, poultry, &c. They are dried and stored in different parts of India, and they keep a great length of time; a single tree yields from 200 to 400 lb. of flowers. From them a very wholesome spirit is distilled very similar in flavour to Irish whisky. This spirit is manufactured largely in India, and the extent of the industry may perhaps be judged from the fact that the Government revenue from this source in one small island of Bombay reached over £80,000 per annum some years ago. The seeds yield a large quantity of oil, of the same value as cocoanut oil, which is used in lamps, to adulterate ghee in the manufacture of candles and soap, for frying cakes, and for other culinary purposes The oil-cake is used for stupefying fish, and the smoke from its combustion is said to kill insects and rats. The timber of this tree is hard and strong, close and even-grained, and is used for the wheels of carriages, railway sleepers, &c. A gum exudes from the bark. The tree may be planted along with tea, coffee, cacao, cinnamon, peppers, arecanut, &c., about 24 ft apart, and, in cocoanut estates, one between every four cocoanut trees.—The Imperial Institute Journal.\nAUSTRIAN WAINSCOT OAK.\nJ.

Subscribed Capital, £255,000.\nGAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nELLIS, HENRY, builder, Balaam Street, Plaistow, E.—This case has already been reported in the TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL, and the bankrupt passed his public examination last week before Mr. Registrar Hope, his accounts showing unsecured debts £1,290 10s. 9d, and a debt fully secured £400, with an estimated surplus in assets of £167 15s. 11d. The bankrupt attributed his failure to his inability to realise houses built by him at West Ham, owing to the action of the freeholder (the petitioning creditor), who, he states, declined to purchase or grant leases of the property.\nFOSTER, STEPHEN, builder, St. Leonards.—This bankrupt attended at Hastings Bankruptcy Court on Monday for public examination, when, after a brief examination, the matter was adjourned. We published the Official Receiver's report last week.\nGOODING, WM. HY., contractor, St. Thomas, Exeter.—The first meeting of creditors herein was held on Tuesday at the Exeter Official Receiver's, when the debtor presented a statement of affairs showing liabilities £749 11s. 4d. The debtor alleged he had sold all his plant, stock, &c., to his mother in August last for £225, and that she then took possession, but the entire amount of the purchase-money was advanced to him previously. The debtor's wife claims the household furniture. The Official Receiver said he should ask the Board of Trade for permission to take proceedings against the debtor's mother, as he thought it monstrous for the debtor to transfer all he had in this manner. Eventually the matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver to realise.\nGRANT & CO. (Lewis Alexander Grant, trading as above), timber merchant, 56, Regent Road, Bootle.—In these bankruptcy proceedings the following are creditors :—\nTaylor, Charles, Sons, & Co., Liverpool .. £ s. d.\nTickle, R.

He admitted receiving £59 19s. within a week before he filed his petition. This had been absorbed in household expenses. By Mr. Jackson, who appeared for the debtor: He paid a sum of about £30 for wages in the week ending the 30th of August. This money came out of the £59 19s., and the balance he gave his wife The examination was again adjourned.\nHOLLICK, ARTHUR, builder, Station Road, Harborne, Birmingham.—In this case the following are creditors :—\n.. .. .. .. .. .. .. £ s. d.\nAdams, Thomas, & Son, Birmingham .. 37 18 0\nBaker, A., Birmingham .. .. .. .. 19 0 0\nFairbank & Co., Birmingham .. .. .. 33 17 10\nGill, Frederick, Smethwick .. .. .. 29 19 9\nLoxley, William, Birmingham .. .. .. 26 9 6\nMoss, C., Birmingham .. .. .. .. 38 8 3\nPayne, E.

B. Duke, who was interested in some building operations in which debtor was concerned, had given Mr. Hetley to pay the debtor, the latter took the things assigned under the bill of sale, and which at the same time were claimed by the Official Receiver, and unlawfully took them away and disposed of some of them.—The Official Receiver pointed out to debtor the serious nature of the offence of which he had been guilty, and also complained of his having given a bill of sale at all under the conditions to Mr. Hedley. He further commented on several preferential payments he had made, including £25 to a Dorchester builder named Watkins, whilst at the same time he owed £100 to Messrs. Bagg, Weymouth.—Eventually the further hearing was adjourned until January 17th to give him an opportunity of explaining the course he had thought proper to take after assigning his property as he had done.\nMASTERMAN, ARTHUR JOB, builder and contractor, Weymouth.—Bankrupt attended at Dorchester Bankruptcy Court on November 29th for public examination.
