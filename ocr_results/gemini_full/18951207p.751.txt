PROPOSED NEW BATHS AT ABERDEEN.

A meeting of the Cleansing Committee of the Town Council on Wednesday brought forward a proposal of considerable magnitude and importance for the erection of new Corporation baths and a swimming pond on the Reclaimed Ground. The site of the proposed bath, according to Baillie's plans, would be on the Reclaimed Ground adjacent to the police stables. The extensive unoccupied space was originally taken over by the Town Council in case additional stabling accommodation should be required. This, however, it is expected will not be likely to occur, and at any rate it is pointed out that, in the event of an extension of the stables, some other place, in a different part of the city, would have to be chosen. The ground is at present used as a storage yard by a slater, and the immediate site of the proposed bathing pond lies at the junction of Palmerston Road and Stell Road. With a view to the utmost economy, the building will be plain, but substantial, with very little outward ornament, save, perhaps, on the frontage, which will lie towards Stell Road. The bath will be considerably larger than the one at the Links, measuring 33 ft. long by 30 ft. wide, with an average depth of 6 ft. As is usually the case, the bath will be lined with smooth tiles. The total cost of the undertaking is put at about £20,000, and when it is considered that the first scheme propounded was estimated at no less than £20,000, it will be admitted that this is a very low figure indeed.

WORKING HOURS IN GLASGOW SHIPBUILDING YARDS.

SETTLEMENT OF CARPENTERS' AND JOINERS' DISPUTE.

The dispute which occurred a fortnight ago in connection with the restriction of working hours in several of the shipbuilding yards has happily come to an end. As will be remembered, the hours arranged by the men were from eight in the morning till five in the afternoon, with three-quarters of an hour for dinner; but in only two of the yards were the notices posted at the time—those of Russell & Co. and Messrs. R. Duncan & Co. Feeling they had a grievance, the carpenters and joiners in the former establishment came out, while the platers and helpers in the last named stopped work. Since then efforts have been made to bring about a settlement, and at a joint conference held on Monday evening in the office of Mr. J. Brodie, secretary of the Greenock and Glasgow Shipbuilders' Association, the matter was fully discussed and a satisfactory arrangement come to. All the firms in Glasgow were represented at the conference, which was attended on behalf of the men by Mr. Wilkie, Newcastle, and Messrs. Galloway & Ramage, district delegates. The terms offered by the masters were that work should commence at a quarter to eight in the morning and stop at a quarter to five in the evening, with half-an-hour for breakfast and three-quarters of an hour for dinner. The delegates subsequently submitted the basis of agreement to the local branches, who approved of the terms, and to-day the men returned to work. The construction in the Kingston yard is now well forward, and the services of the carpenters and joiners will be fully utilised.

NOON PIER QUESTION.—The opposition of the Commissioners to the proposal of the pier southwards, and have to extend the pier southwards, and have separate gangways, one for goods and the other for passenger traffic, still continues. The matter threatens to lead to no end of difficulty unless it is finally disposed of. With a view to further steps being taken, a public meeting has been called by requisition, the object of which is to consider the action of the Commissioners. The majority of only one gangway, and want that the passenger entrance to the pier should be as near the town as practicable.

BUILDING NEWS.

At a meeting of the Forth Navigation Commission, it was reported that offers were about to be taken for the deepening of the fairway of the Forth, the offers to state the cost of the deepening in two ways—one to a depth of 2 ft., and the other to a depth of 18 in.

A new building for the secondary department of Niddrie Road School, Portobello, Edinburgh, has been formally opened. The new portion forms one large room, but by means of sliding partitions it can be divided into two rooms. Mr. Robert Wilson, of Edinburgh, was the architect.

The annual social meeting of the employes of Mr. George Hall, builder, Aberdeen, was held in the Queen's Rooms the other night. The hall was tastefully decorated, and a sumptuous tea was served. The company present numbered about 300, and the chair was occupied by Mr. Hall.

The parish church at Symington, N.B., has been reopened. The building has been reconstructed and considerably enlarged by the addition of an apse at the east end, widening the north transept, and a new entrance and entrance porch at the west end. A small vestry, with heating cellar below, has also been built. The church is heated by hot-water pipes above the floor, and ventilated. The cost of the improvements, for which Messrs. Hardy & Wight, of Edinburgh, were the architects, has been about £600.

A new illuminated turret clock, showing four external dials, 6 ft. each in diameter, and striking the hours and Cambridge chimes upon five bells, has been presented to the Presbyterian Free Church in Scotland at Coldstream by Mr. R. Hogg, of that town, in memory of his uncle. A friend also presented the bells for the chimes in memory of the first minister. The whole of the work has been carried out by Messrs. William Potts & Sons, clock manufacturers, of Guildford Street, Leeds, and Newcastle-on-Tyne.

Arrangements are being rapidly completed for the formation of a Union Club for Edinburgh, and the buildings now occupied by the Albert Hotel, Hanover Street, in that city, and premises adjoining, have been secured for the purpose. Plans have been prepared by Messrs. Dunn & Findlay, architects, which show that, after the alterations have been carried out, the club will contain the usual accommodation of a high-class town club, including dining-rooms, smoking, reading, and billiard rooms. It is estimated that the alterations will cost about £3,000.

The Leith Town Council have decided to maintain their opposition to the proposed Edinburgh cholera hospital being within Leith. The city authorities have received warrant in the Edinburgh Dean of Guild Court to remove a portion of the enclosure at the north-east corner of the observatory ground on the Calton Hill, and build on the site another observatory building. The new structure, which is destined for the accommodation of the large telescope now at Murrayfield, will be octagonal in shape, and of classical proportions, in keeping with the existing buildings. It is to be 35 ft. in diameter internally. It is proposed to introduce an electric motor to revolve the dome. The cost of the new observatory, the plans for which have been prepared by Mr. Morham, city superintendent of works, is estimated at about £2,200.
