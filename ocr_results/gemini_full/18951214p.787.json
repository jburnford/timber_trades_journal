  "text": "DECEMBER 14, 1895.\n\nGLASGOW.\n\nProfessor Baldwin and his clever little lent were cordially\n\nEDINBURGH.\n\nImportant additions have just been completed to St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Broughton Street, with the object of improving the internal appearance of the church and providing additional accommodation. Mr. J. T. Smith sanctioned the designs, which included the addition of vestries, lobby, and baptistery, and the erection of the handsome new high altar. These were finished a few months ago. Owing to the limited area at disposal, difficulty was experienced in providing the new accessions. The work just completed includes the erection of a new sanctuary, chancel, and a side chapel, and the removal of the old vestries, lobby, and baptistery of former clergy-house. The erection of the cathedral, some years ago, left a portion of a baptistery at the north-west corner of Broughton Street front still unbuilt upon, and the house for the accommodation of the clergy was acquired at No. 24, George Street. A passage was formed through this house, with the vestries and side chapel to the left, and passing under the new chancel to the sanctuary and baptistery, which have been situated at the back of the building, and in connection with which a new west gable has been built on the site of the old vestry. The new chancel is about 20 ft. in width, with a height of about 40 ft., the aisles being 10 ft. wide. The new vestries and side chapel have been built on the north aisle of the chancel, and the additions have been carried out in a style of a somewhat severe Gothic, to harmonise with the rest of the work. The work has been executed from the designs of Messrs.\n\nThe Dean of Guild Court to the Governors of the Heriot Trust have granted a warrant to Mr. W. W. Robertson, of Guild Court to the Observatory Committee, to inclose wall at the back of the City Observatory ground at Calton Hill, and to build on the site a new dome for the new building. The new dome is intended for the accommodation of the large telescope now at Dunecht. It is octagonal in shape, and 34 ft. in diameter, and in keeping with the style of the old dome, is to be 35 ft. in height from the floor to the crown of the dome, with a gallery at the angles. Sir Howard Grubb, Dublin, is making for it a new equatorial, to be covered with 1/4 in. steel plates, and which will be surmounted by an ornamental finial. It is proposed to introduce an electric motor to work the dome, and the cost of the new dome and its fittings, for which have been prepared by Mr. Thomas Morham, City Superintendent of Works, is estimated at about £3,000.—*Building News*.\n\nTRADES JOURNAL\nTY OF\nMARKS on DEALS,\nOARDS, TIMBER,\nwood goods, exported from\nnd, Russia, Germany and\nish and French classifica-\nand Continental agents for\ning districts on the east\nHaparanda to Gefle are\nhown the exact position of\nalso chart of the Bothn\nway, indicating the position\netical list of the marks is\nrangement, and the figures\nsecond column of this\nthe pages in the first por-\nshipper's name, port of\nfirm's relating to each\nfined.

The estimated cost of the Dumfries scheme is £5,074.\n\nAt a meeting of the sub-committee of the Public Health Committee of the Edinburgh Town Council held yesterday week a remit was made to the medical officer of health and the city superintendent of works to report to the committee, under a remit recently made to them, as to the character of the buildings they would recommend should be erected on the new site at Colinton Mains.\n\nThe parish of Cadder (Lanark) is to be formed into a special water-supply district embracing the villages of Stepps Road, Chryston, Muirhead, Gartoosh, Garnqueen, and Moodiesburn, as also the Gartloch asylum now in course of completion.

Sydney Mitchell & Wilson, the architects for the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, designed a new chimney for the institution, and the work of erecting it is nearly completed. The chimney is of red brick, with red stone mouldings and cornices, and measures 16 ft. in diameter at the base and 7 ft. in diameter at the top. It is circular in plan, and 108 ft., but at that distance from the ground it is perfectly plain for an arcaded band in brickwork 6 ft. high. This arcade is crowned with a projecting moulded band of stone. The shaft is again plain for another 30 ft. At this point the plan is changed from a circle to an octagon by means of stone corbelling. Immediately above this is a broad, overhanging, ornamental stone band 5 ft. high. This band consists of deep brackets connected together on the top with arches and finished with stone balls at the angles of the octagon. Above this there is another shallow band of plain brickwork, and then comes a stone band inclining inwards, ornamented on the alternate faces with semi-circular pediments which die at the sides into the incline of the band. Above these are arched recesses, 10 ft. high, with brick pilasters. These arches are of stone, and are crowned with a triangular pediments. Over these pediments there comes the deep stone cornice with which the chimney ends.\n\nRESULTS OF TENDERS.\n\nDUNDEE.—For iron and steel work and fire-proof construction in the new Prudential Assurance Company's buildings, Albert Square, Dundee.
