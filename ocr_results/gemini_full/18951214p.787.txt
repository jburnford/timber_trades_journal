EDINBURGH.

Important additions have just been completed to St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Broughton Street, with the object of improving the internal appearance of the church and providing additional accommodation. Mr. J. T. Smith sanctioned the designs, which included the addition of vestries, lobby, and baptistery, and the erection of the handsome new high altar. These were finished a few months ago. Owing to the limited area at disposal, difficulty was experienced in providing the new accessions. The work just completed includes the erection of a new sanctuary, chancel, and a side chapel, and the removal of the old vestries, lobby, and baptistery of former clergy-house. The erection of the cathedral, some years ago, left a portion of a baptistery at the north-west corner of Broughton Street front still unbuilt upon, and the house for the accommodation of the clergy was acquired at No. 24, George Street. A passage was formed through this house, with the vestries and side chapel to the left, and passing under the new chancel to the sanctuary and baptistery, which have been situated at the back of the building, and in connection with which a new west gable has been built on the site of the old vestry. The new chancel is about 20 ft. in width, with a height of about 40 ft., the aisles being 10 ft. wide. The new vestries and side chapel have been built on the north aisle of the chancel, and the additions have been carried out in a style of a somewhat severe Gothic, to harmonise with the rest of the work. The work has been executed from the designs of Messrs.

The Dean of Guild Court to the Governors of the Heriot Trust have granted a warrant to Mr. W. W. Robertson, of Guild Court to the Observatory Committee, to inclose wall at the back of the City Observatory ground at Calton Hill, and to build on the site a new dome for the new building. The new dome is intended for the accommodation of the large telescope now at Dunecht. It is octagonal in shape, and 34 ft. in diameter, and in keeping with the style of the old dome, is to be 35 ft. in height from the floor to the crown of the dome, with a gallery at the angles. Sir Howard Grubb, Dublin, is making for it a new equatorial, to be covered with 1/4 in. steel plates, and which will be surmounted by an ornamental finial. It is proposed to introduce an electric motor to work the dome, and the cost of the new dome and its fittings, for which have been prepared by Mr. Thomas Morham, City Superintendent of Works, is estimated at about £3,000.—*Building News*.

BUILDING NEWS.

This week we report the results of some tenders which have been invited in Dundee, Edinburgh, Leith, and Ross-shire. We shall be glad to hear from correspondents in other parts of Scotland of the closing of other contracts.

The buildings of the *Glasgow Herald* have been added to, and have a striking appearance at the corner of Mitchell Street and Mitchell Lane, Glasgow. We notice that the floors are laid with American oak. Mr. Matthew Henderson was responsible for the joinery work.

At Cupar an inquiry has been held in connection with an application by the Water Commissioners of the burgh for a provisional order to authorise an increased supply of water to the Fife and Kinross District Asylum and other purposes, and the borrowing of £7,000 for this object.

At Dumfries it is proposed to construct a new main sewer which shall intercept the whole drainage of the town and discharge it into the Nith at a point a little below Kingholm Cottage, and the Commissioners of the burgh of Maxwelltown contemplate carrying a main drain down the opposite side of the river to near the same point. The estimated cost of the Dumfries scheme is £5,074.

At a meeting of the sub-committee of the Public Health Committee of the Edinburgh Town Council held yesterday week a remit was made to the medical officer of health and the city superintendent of works to report to the committee, under a remit recently made to them, as to the character of the buildings they would recommend should be erected on the new site at Colinton Mains.

The parish of Cadder (Lanark) is to be formed into a special water-supply district embracing the villages of Stepps Road, Chryston, Muirhead, Gartoosh, Garnqueen, and Moodiesburn, as also the Gartloch asylum now in course of completion. The water will be pumped to the high-level tank at Lethamhill and distributed in pipes from thence. The necessary works are to be proceeded with.

Messrs. A. Waterhouse & Son, London, the architects of the new buildings for the Prudential Insurance Company in St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh, and Albert Square, Dundee, have placed the contracts for the fireproof construction (under Mr. Boyd Wilson's patent), including the whole of the structural steel and iron work of the buildings, with Messrs. Arrol's Bridge and Roof Company, Limited, Germiston Works, Glasgow.

mitted and ordered to be paid. The contractor's accounts amounted to £833 12s. 4d., the architect's to £41 13s., and the measurer's to £23 1s. 4d., making a total of £898 8s. 4d. To this would fall to be added £10 for painting, £90 for sundries—making a grand total of £993 8s. 4d.

Messrs. Sydney Mitchell & Wilson, the architects for the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, designed a new chimney for the institution, and the work of erecting it is nearly completed. The chimney is of red brick, with red stone mouldings and cornices, and measures 16 ft. in diameter at the base and 7 ft. in diameter at the top. It is circular in plan, and 108 ft., but at that distance from the ground it is perfectly plain for an arcaded band in brickwork 6 ft. high. This arcade is crowned with a projecting moulded band of stone. The shaft is again plain for another 30 ft. At this point the plan is changed from a circle to an octagon by means of stone corbelling. Immediately above this is a broad, overhanging, ornamental stone band 5 ft. high. This band consists of deep brackets connected together on the top with arches and finished with stone balls at the angles of the octagon. Above this there is another shallow band of plain brickwork, and then comes a stone band inclining inwards, ornamented on the alternate faces with semi-circular pediments which die at the sides into the incline of the band. Above these are arched recesses, 10 ft. high, with brick pilasters. These arches are of stone, and are crowned with a triangular pediments. Over these pediments there comes the deep stone cornice with which the chimney ends.
