H., builder, Hanley.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor was held at the Hanley Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday week, before Mr. Registrar Tennant. The debtor's statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £648 2s. 10d., and assets estimated to produce £395 14s. 2d. The Official Receiver stated that the debtor was ordered at the last Court to file a cash account showing all receipts and payments from July 1st to the date of the receiving order, and an account showing the profit and loss on the contracts he had undertaken. The debtor had filed certain accounts, but they were not very satisfactory, however the debtor said he could not do any better. He said he had lost on every contract. The Official Receiver said that the debtor could have found out his position long ago if he had taken the trouble to go into his affairs. The examination was eventually ordered to be closed.\nBARNAR, W. R., box and packing-case manufacturer, Fann Street, E.C.—The bankrupt attended for his public examination on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard, and, in reply to the Assistant Receiver, he stated that he commenced business in April, 1892, of having no capital of his own, but his mother lent him £200. In the deficiency account which he had filed the loss on trading between April, 1892, and the date of his failure was entered at £917. That figure was a pure estimate. He found after he came to the Court that the loss of a certain sum had to be accounted for, and he made the entry of £917 in order to balance the account. His drawings from the business during the same time were entered at £370. The loss in the business was caused through bad trade and heavy expenses. Throughout his trading he had borrowed from his mother, to whom he was now owing £600. In October last a meeting of his creditors was held, and in November he filed his petition. The examination was concluded, the accounts showing liabilities £1,487 9s. 1d., and assets £94 9s. 4d.\nAUSTRIAN WAINSCOT\nJ. H. ROWNTREE, 30, Great St. Helens, L\nTELEGRAMS—\"GRACENOTE, LONDON.\"\n\nBUTTERFIELD, THOMAS, builder and undertaker, 183, West Street, Drogheda, is arranging with his creditors, among whom are the following:—\n£ s. d.\nL'Estrange & Co., London .. .. 9 14 0\nIngall, Parsons, Clive, & Co., Birmingham .. .. 48 11 3\nMurdoch, Francis, & Co., Birmingham .. .. 10 0 0\nNew Mills Co., Drogheda .. .. 11 13 9\nDidmond, Robert, Drogheda .. .. 13 12 6\nDaly, Gerald, Drogheda .. .. 12 0 0\nBallour, H.

On the previous evening the debtor had handed in a rough statement of affairs, which showed liabilities amounting to nearly £300 and nett assets about £90. The debtor had not attempted to account for his deficiency. As the debtor had been already adjudicated bankrupt, the estate was left in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.\nCOX, L. L., trading as Meshach Cox & Son builders, Rodborough, near Stroud. — The public examination of this debtor was resumed last week. A previous report of this case appeared in our issue of October 26th. Mr. Clutterbuck appeared for the trustee, and Mr. Langley-Smith for Mr. W. P. Niblett, a creditor. In reply to Mr. Langley-Smith, the debtor said he took over his father's business in 1887, and after that date Mr. Cox, senior, was not authorised to get orders or pay accounts. He simply worked for debtor as a journeyman. It was not before a twelvemonth after debtor had taken over the business that he had taken the name of Meshach Cox & Son. He had his father's permission to use his name, but on the other hand he did not afterwards object to it. Debtor did not acquaint any of his father's or anybody else of his having taken over the business. There never had been a partnership existing between debtor and his father. Debtor knew nothing about going with his father to Mr. Niblett on March 9th, 1890, when it was alleged Mr. Cox, senior, ordered certain goods, and paid Mr. Niblett £20 on account. Debtor was bankrupt aware that since that date his father had constantly given orders to Mr. Niblett under the old name. He was never authorised to do so. After further questions by the Official Receiver and the Registrar, in which the former, in questioning the debtor as to a deed of partnership between debtor and his father—which debtor denied—produced a lease signed and rented for five years bearing the joint signatures of debtor and his father, Mr. Langley-Smith asked that bankrupt should not be allowed to pass his examination until he had furnished an account to the Official Receiver of his cash accounts for the twelve months prior to his bankruptcy. An order was made for the debtor to furnish a statement of his cash accounts for the twelve months prior to his bankruptcy, the examination to stand adjourned until February 4th.\nGRANT, LEWIS ALEXANDER. — The debtor, who had been engaged in the Liverpool timber trade, appeared on his public examination, at Liverpool, on Thursday week, with a statement of affairs which showed liabilities £3,825 3s. 6d., and net assets £887 3s. 6d., leaving a deficiency of £2,938.
