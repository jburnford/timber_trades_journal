M., builder, &c., of Tilehurst Road, Reading.—The public examination of the debtor was fixed for Thursday last week, at the Reading Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Collins. The liabilities were £270, and the assets nil. The report of the Official Receiver showed that the debtor was a carpenter, and raised £1,200, which he speculated in house building, and, as he alleged, had to sell a house which cost £850 for £600. The examination was adjourned.\nAUSTRIAN WAINSCOT OAK.\n30, Great St. Helens, LONDON, E.C.\nTELEGRAMS—\"GRACENOTE, LONDON.\"\n\nLEWIS, ARTHUR W., builder and contractor, Edgefield.—Liabilities £2,273 6s. 6d.; deficiency, £992 5s. 3d.—Debtor said at the Norwich Bankruptcy Court, last week, that he had been in business for the past seven years, commencing with a capital of £20, and after being questioned on several matters, the examination was adjourned.\nGRIMES, S. L., timber merchant's agent, 15, Buckley Road, Kilburn.—Upon the application of Messrs. Remnant & Sanders, a receiving order was made in this case by Mr. Registrar Hope on Saturday under a creditor's petition. No particulars of the debtor's affairs were given.\nHAMMOND, E. & SONS, timber merchants, Station Street, Nottingham.—The public examination of these debtors was closed at the Nottingham Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Speed, on the 19th inst.\nPORTER, EDWARD, builder, Orient Street, Southwark, S.E.—The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Monday, before Mr. E. L. Hough, Official Receiver. The statement of affairs showed unsecured debts, £686; debts fully secured, £126; and preferential claims, £40. Assets, £345. The creditors include the following :—\nUNSECURED.\n£ s. d.\nAdamson & Sons, Chiswick ... 94 0 0\nPutney, S., timber merchant, Borough Road, S.E. ... 177 14 4\nThe debtor commenced business in 1881 with a small capital, and attributes his failure to loss on a contract for the pulling down and erection of houses at Orient Street. The Chairman reported that he had, acting upon the instructions given to him at a preliminary meeting of creditors, sold the debtor's furniture for £230, and the stock, plant, materials, &c., for £56 17s. After paying the rents due he had a balance of £259 5s. 6d. in hand, and as there were only a few book debts to be collected the estate was practically realised. The matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver to be wound up in the usual course of bankruptcy.\nSEDDON, SHEPHERD, & CO., Ltd., timber importers, Great Grimsby.—On Monday, before Mr. A. S. Cully, Assistant Official Receiver, the adjourned meeting of the shareholders and creditors was held. The Official Receiver reported that at the previous meeting he had had an interview with Mr. Attley, representing the debenture-holders, to negotiate for the purchase of the stock, but by which they would have been enabled to secure 11s. in the £. The whole of the business of the company, he considered, should be in the hands of the official liquidator. He pointed out that the arrangement which had been entered into would have been more beneficial to the Official Receiver's department. In his (the Receiver's) view of the matter, it was the intention of the Board of Trade that where creditors were consulted were not to be consulted, but where private gentlemen were appointed, the whole duties of liquidator should be performed. The remuneration which had been allowed to him was his duty to see was properly applied for the costs of the liquidation, and also for the interests of the creditors, and particularly for the interests of the shareholders. The premature realisation of the company's stock. He did not consider the manner in which the debentures were exercised had been legal. The debentures had been highly improper. The shareholders were also dissatisfied with the resolution presented to them at the previous meeting, which they had no opportunity of discussing, which appeared to be cut and dried for the creditors.\nIn favour of the resolution, Mr. Palliser, representing the debenture-holders, liquidator, was heard, and ultimately the committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Marshall, of Bishopsgate Street, London, timber merchant, Mr. S. K. G. Williamson, of Grimsby, Churchill, of London, and Mr. Seddon, timber merchants, was appointed. Mr. Lawrence, of Hall, of Bishopsgate Street, and Mr. Holmes, solicitor, were also appointed. Mr. Son. At the close of the meeting, later in the day, it was announced that the creditors were duly appointed.\nSUDDALL, THOMAS, joiner and builder, East View, Blackpool.—The debtor was publicly examined at the Preston Bankruptcy Court on Friday. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £671 13s. 8d., and the assets were nil to produce £582 13s. 8d. The debtor commenced business in 1891, at East View, with no capital. He attributed his failure to his premises being too small for his trade. He had contracted for several buildings, and was insolvent to the extent of £300. He amounted to £1,000. He admitted having an extraordinary number of dishonoured bills to have outstanding. The liabilities on the 29th, 1894, his books showed were £90 13s. 8d. The debtor, in reply to questions, said he was merely a guess sending the trustee's statement. After other questions to the debtor, the examination was then closed.\nTUNBRIDGE, WILLIAM, builder, Cressing, appleby.—The debtor came up for his bankruptcy at the Chelmsford Bankruptcy Court. The receiving order was made on his own petition. Liabilities were returned in the statement of affairs to amount to £224 3s. 6d., and the assets, on the bankrupt's estimate, were expected to realise £4 0s. 0½d. in the £. The debtor attributed his failure to Honour suspended for two years.\nMAP OF SWEDEN AND NORWAY, on canvas and rollers, specially prepared and suitable for hanging in the office, may be had at the Timber Trades Journal Office, price 7s. 6d. of Finland, and Russia.\nWILLIAM RIDER & SON, LIMITED, BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE, LONDON, E.C.",
