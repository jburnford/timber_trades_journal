£ s. d.
Adamson & Sons, Chiswick ... 94 0 0
Putney, S., timber merchant, Borough Road, S.E. ... 177 14 4
The debtor commenced business in 1881 with a small capital, and attributes his failure to loss on a contract for the pulling down and erection of houses at Orient Street. The Chairman reported that he had, acting upon the instructions given to him at a preliminary meeting of creditors, sold the debtor's furniture for £230, and the stock, plant, materials, &c., for £56 17s. After paying the rents due he had a balance of £259 5s. 6d. in hand, and as there were only a few book debts to be collected the estate was practically realised. The matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver to be wound up in the usual course of bankruptcy.
SEDDON, SHEPHERD, & CO., Ltd., timber importers, Great Grimsby.—On Monday, before Mr. A. S. Cully, Assistant Official Receiver, the adjourned meeting of the shareholders and creditors was held. The Official Receiver reported that at the previous meeting he had had an interview with Mr. Attley, representing the debenture-holders, to negotiate for the purchase of the stock, but by which they would have been enabled to secure 11s. in the £. The whole of the business of the company, he considered, should be in the hands of the official liquidator. He pointed out that the arrangement which had been entered into would have been more beneficial to the Official Receiver's department. In his (the Receiver's) view of the matter, it was the intention of the Board of Trade that where creditors were consulted were not to be consulted, but where private gentlemen were appointed, the whole duties of liquidator should be performed. The remuneration which had been allowed to him was his duty to see was properly applied for the costs of the liquidation, and also for the interests of the creditors, and particularly for the interests of the shareholders. The premature realisation of the company's stock. He did not consider the manner in which the debentures were exercised had been legal. The debentures had been highly improper. The shareholders were also dissatisfied with the resolution presented to them at the previous meeting, which they had no opportunity of discussing, which appeared to be cut and dried for the creditors.
In favour of the resolution, Mr. Palliser, representing the debenture-holders, liquidator, was heard, and ultimately the committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Marshall, of Bishopsgate Street, London, timber merchant, Mr. S. K. G. Williamson, of Grimsby, Churchill, of London, and Mr. Seddon, timber merchants, was appointed. Mr. Lawrence, of Hall, of Bishopsgate Street, and Mr. Holmes, solicitor, were also appointed. Mr. Son. At the close of the meeting, later in the day, it was announced that the creditors were duly appointed.
