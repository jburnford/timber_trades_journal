TRADE REPORTS.

GLASGOW.
There is little change to note here during the past week, sales being as usual at this season of the year confined chiefly to small quantities to meet special wants, and no decided improvement in this respect is not looked for till after the New Year holidays.
Particulars of the stocks on hand in the various ports are now being made up, and will be submitted next week, showing the comparative position, which is always a matter of interest at this time.
The outlook is considered favourable, and a good deal of confidence is felt in the continuance of the steady demand and improving tone of prices that have characterised the past year's business.
The trade in deals has been of growing importance at Glasgow, and has shown special activity throughout this year, and the want of adequate storage room is much felt, the accommodation provided by the Clyde trustees at Yorkhill being clearly insufficient.
The deficiencies of Yorkhill have been to some extent supplied of recent years by a large piece of ground contiguous to Yorkhill yards, but this ground has lately been sold and will not after this be available for storage of wood, and what is lying there will have to be removed, we hear, within a few weeks.
It would be an advantage having one central depot rather than places of storage at some distance apart, but whatever is done it can hardly be doubted, with the experience of recent years, that Yorkhill alone is insufficient to meet the requirements of this trade.
The imports during the past week have consisted of parcels per steamships from the States amounting to upwards of 1,000 loads, and one full cargo of spruce (mostly thin stuff), consigned to Messrs. Singleton, Dunn, & Co., per "Sea," from Bersimis, a Canadian port.
Particulars of the steamer above referred to will be seen from the accompanying list; nearly half of the quantity stated is made up of oak in planks, scantlings, &c., and among the other consignments will be observed a lot of 75 logs round mahogany to Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells, which is worthy the attention of buyers; also a parcel of pine deals, comprising 1st and 2nd quality 12 3 and broader, to Messrs. Wright, Graham, & Co.; the narrow boards included with same shipment have been disposed of ex quay.
Messrs. Cant & Kemp have a parcel of 50 billets Austrian oak, of which during the past year there has been an extremely light import.

LEITH.
Since last report the arrivals are few and unimportant, consisting of 55 poplar logs, 3,007 hickory squares, and 54 oak planks, per "Menantic" (s), from Baltimore; 160 fathoms firewood per "Carmen," from Christiansand; and 63,018 oak staves per "Savona" (s), from Danzig.
The discharge of the cargo of Oregon pine ex "Thermopylae," referred to in last week's proceeding, and the quality of what has been already landed and piled on quay, consisting of 4, 5, and 6 x 12 to 24 in. planks, is remarkably fine, being absolutely bright wood, free of all defects.
The cargo is well worth attention, and it is to be hoped that the experiment of shipping such a fine cargo will prove successful.
Business generally has been very quiet this week, and there will be little more done now until after the New Year holidays.

GREENOCK.
Since last report a fortnight ago there has been a single arrival, and we do not hear of any cargoes afloat bound for this port at present time.
We hope to submit statement of stocks at Greenock and Port Glasgow as at 31st current, from which it will be seen that the stocks on the whole are considerably lighter than at the end of 1894, if we except such items as waney boardwood, 1st and 3rd yellow deals, spruce deals, hewn pitch pine, greenheart, teak timber, and planks.
The public works in this vicinity will, in all probability, close on Saturday, while some will continue to work on till Tuesday after-noon, and then stop for the New Year holidays, which usually run for a fortnight.
