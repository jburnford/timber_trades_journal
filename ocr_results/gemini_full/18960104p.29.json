Leslie & Hay, well known Aberdeen builders, have just held their annual reunion in the lecture-room of the Albert Hall in the Granite City.\n* * *\nThe Dalhousie Trustees have informed the Carmyllie (Forfarshire) Parish Council that they are willing to contribute £450, being half the estimated cost of the construction of the proposed new roads.\n* * *\nThe Greenock School Board has been discussing the erection of a new school in Nelson Street. They have decided not to accept any of the plans already submitted, but to invite new competitive plans.\n* * *\nAt the Edinburgh Dean of Guild Court there were eighteen applications, and out of that number six warrants were granted. A warrant was granted for certain deviations in the plans already passed in connection with the new skating rink at St. Stephen Street.\n* * *\nMost of the work in connection with the re-building of Old Mar Castle has been given to local employers, which is just as it should be. The celebrated old castle will, when remodelled, retain all its picturesque appearance, and internally will be adapted to modern residential requirements.\n* * *\nThe Lanarkshire County Council have instructed the clerk to write Sir Charles Ross offering a sum for the lease of a portion of ground for the purpose of building a hospital at Lanark. A twelve-bedded hospital is proposed, to cost about £2,400. A committee was appointed to carry out the necessary arrangements.\n* * *\nBalmoral Castle is to be supplied with the electric light. The motive-power is to be taken, not from the Dee, but from the Gelder. In the first instance the electric light will be introduced in the ballroom only, but ultimately, no doubt, all the rooms in the Castle will be supplied. It is stated that the expenditure contemplated in the meantime is about £1,400.\n\nRESULTS OF TENDERS.\n\nABERDEEN.—For the construction of about 140 lineal yards of sewer in Union Grove, and the laying of about 330 lineal yards of 24 in., 21 in., and 12 in. fireclay pipes in South Forest Road, for the Town Council.
