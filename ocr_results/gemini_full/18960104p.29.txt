* * *
The employes of Messrs. Leslie & Hay, well known Aberdeen builders, have just held their annual reunion in the lecture-room of the Albert Hall in the Granite City.
* * *
The Dalhousie Trustees have informed the Carmyllie (Forfarshire) Parish Council that they are willing to contribute £450, being half the estimated cost of the construction of the proposed new roads.
* * *
The Greenock School Board has been discussing the erection of a new school in Nelson Street. They have decided not to accept any of the plans already submitted, but to invite new competitive plans.
* * *
At the Edinburgh Dean of Guild Court there were eighteen applications, and out of that number six warrants were granted. A warrant was granted for certain deviations in the plans already passed in connection with the new skating rink at St. Stephen Street.
* * *
Most of the work in connection with the re-building of Old Mar Castle has been given to local employers, which is just as it should be. The celebrated old castle will, when remodelled, retain all its picturesque appearance, and internally will be adapted to modern residential requirements.
* * *
The Lanarkshire County Council have instructed the clerk to write Sir Charles Ross offering a sum for the lease of a portion of ground for the purpose of building a hospital at Lanark. A twelve-bedded hospital is proposed, to cost about £2,400. A committee was appointed to carry out the necessary arrangements.

Balmoral Castle is to be supplied with the electric light. The motive-power is to be taken, not from the Dee, but from the Gelder. In the first instance the electric light will be introduced in the ballroom only, but ultimately, no doubt, all the rooms in the Castle will be supplied. It is stated that the expenditure contemplated in the meantime is about £1,400.
