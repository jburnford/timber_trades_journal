FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
BEBROUTH, R. W., builder, Church Street, Croydon.-The bankrupt attended at the Croydon Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Fox, for adjourned public examination. Mr. Alex. Mackintosh (Official Receiver), said he had completed his examination, but the trustee (Mr. R. J. Ward) wished him to put certain questions to him. In the course of his examination he was entitled to a fifth share of a reversionary interest in two cottages which he had not charged in any way. In May last he paid £67 10s., which was 10 per cent., deposit upon the purchase of 14 plots of land. He never completed the purchase, and consequently had forfeited the deposit. He admitted repaying £35 advanced him by the secretary of one of the land companies under which he was building after he knew he was insolvent; also that he kept an engine in repair, although he only held it on a hire agreement. He consented to attend at the trustee's and give him full particulars concerning these matters, upon which the Registrar made an order for further examination.
BELL, ROBERT, builder, Church Bank, Wallsend.-The bankrupt's public examination was held at Newcastle. Debtor's deed the following statement of affairs:-Unsecured creditors, £1,100 12s. 1d.; creditors fully secured, £1,150; estimated value of securities, £1,200; surplus to contra, £50; creditors partly secured, £1,000; estimated value of securities, £500; deficiency to rank for dividend, £500; total to rank for dividend, £1,600 12s. 1d. Assets:-Cash in hand, £1 10s.; stock-in-trade, £150; book debts, £100; furniture, £20; property, £1,200; total, £1,471 10s. Deduct preferential creditors, £10; net assets, £1,461 10s. Deficiency, £149 2s. 1d. The following are creditors:-Beal, W., Wallsend... £10; Beck, E., & Son, Newcastle... £10; Dove, J., & Co., Limited, Newcastle... £10; Einley & Co., Newcastle... £10; Hedderley, Thos., Newcastle... £10; Herring, John, & Son, North Shields... £10; Hutchinson, John, & Son, Newcastle... £10; Marr, C., & Co., Newcastle... £10; Somerset, A., & Co., Newcastle... £10; Union Cement Co., Newcastle... £10; Wilson, A., & Sons, Aberdeen... £10; Wilson, R., Birtley... £10
CRISP, WM., builder, Dudley.-The public examination of this debtor was held at Dudley Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Hooper. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt showed liabilities amounting to £942, and assets £100, leaving a deficiency of £842. In reply to the Official Receiver, the bankrupt said he commenced business in 1887, and after that date he had been a builder. He first became a bankrupt in 1887, and after that he made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, under which they were paid 10s. in the pound. The present failure was brought about by one of the creditors pressing him. The Registrar said he should adjourn the examination in order that the bankrupt might be able to file a proper deficiency account, and one that he might give a proper and satisfactory explanation of the deficiency to the Court. The debtor must also file a cash account, showing all his financial transactions for the six months immediately preceding the date of the receiving order. The examination was adjourned until the next Court.
GOODING, W., builder, of St. Thomas, Exeter.-The public examination at Exeter Bankruptcy Court was consented by Mr. Harris, the Deputy Official Receiver (Mr. Andrew), to be adjourned, as the money due to unsecured creditors amounted to £722, and to creditors fully secured £1,100, taxes £27 3s. 2d. The bankrupt had been in business as a builder since August, 1894, he then having £500, which he had from his mother. He had lost £200, as he was threatened with an action, and he claimed the furniture as his wife's. The debtor contended that he was not aware of the state of his affairs, and did not know he was insolvent until the remainder.—Ultimately the examination was further adjourned.

Under the failure of Helas & S[?], the following are creditors:-Blanchard, G., Hull... £10; Collingwood & Co., Hull... £10; Kington Enamelled Slate Co., Hull... £10; Laverack & Goddard, Hull... £10; Mortimer, W., Hull... £10; Myers, Fras., Hull... £10; Pickard & Geary, Hull... £10; Robinson, C., Hull... £10; Sanderson Bros., Hull... £10; Sannor, G., New Holland... £10; Shanks, G., Hull... £10; Simpson, Holderness... £10; Wild & Son, Hull... £10
