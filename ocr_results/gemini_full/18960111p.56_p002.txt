FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
BEBROUTH, R. W., builder, Waddon Street, Croydon.—The bankrupt attended at the Croydon Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Fox, for adjourned public examination. Mr. Alex. Mackintosh (Official Receiver) said he had completed his examination, but the trustee (Mr. R. J. Ward) wished him to put certain questions to the bankrupt. In the course of his examination he stated he was entitled to a fifth share of a reversionary interest in two cottages which he had not charged in any way. In May last he had £67 10s., which was 10 per cent., deposit on the purchase of 14 plots of land. He had not completed the purchase, and consequently had forfeited the deposit. He admitted receiving £35 advanced him by the secretary of one of the land companies under which he was purchasing after he knew he was insolvent; also that he kept an engine in repair, although it was held on a hire agreement. He consented to attend at the trustee's and give him full particulars concerning these matters, upon which
H. Adkins on the 18th inst., made an order closing the bankruptcy.

CRISP, WM., builder, Dudley.—The public examination of this debtor was held at the Dudley Bankruptcy Court, on Monday last, before Mr. Registrar Kettle. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt disclosed liabilities amounting to £942, and the assets, after deducting the claims of preferential creditors, payable in full, were estimated to produce £104 16s. 2d. The debtor in reply to questions put by the Official Receiver stated that his failure had been caused through losses owing to the long frost of last winter, loss of horses, and legal expenses. He commenced business in Dudley in 1893. He first became a master man at Barry Dock, in 1887, and after that he worked as foreman at Birmingham. Whilst in business at Barry Dock he made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, under which he paid a composition of 10s. in the pound. The business was then taken over by one of the creditors. His liabilities at that time amounted to about £300. The Registrar said he should adjourn the examination in order that the debtor might be enabled to file a proper deficiency account, and in order that he might give a satisfactory account or explanation of the loss of his specifications. The debtor must also file a proper cash account, showing all his financial transactions for the six months immediately preceding the date of the receiving order. The examination was then adjourned until the next Court.
GOODING, WILLIAM HENRY, builder, of St. Thomas, appeared for his public examination at Exeter last week, being represented by Mr. Harris.—In answer to the Official Receiver (Mr. Andrew), the debtor stated that the money due to unsecured creditors amounted to £722, and to creditors for rent, rates, and taxes £27 3s. 2d. He had no assets. He had been in business as a builder for 20 years. In August, 1894, he transferred a lot of property to his mother. He transferred it under pressure, as he was threatened with an action. His wife claimed the furniture, which was worth about £50. Debtor could not say where the furniture was as he did not know. His wife bought some of the furniture, and her father left her the remainder.—Ultimately the examination was further adjourned for a fortnight.

during the time they were in business the assets were about £400. They had book debts, £22 15s. 5d, which were absorbed by preferential claims. The debtor had been 25 years in business up to September last, and was now employed as manager by a company (since proved for £3,578) to complete the contracts for which had been taken from the debtor to Mr. Punnett (who had guaranteed certain houses, which had since been transferred to Mr. Punnett. Two previous failures were recorded against the debtor, who in 1877 paid a composition of 4s. in the pound, and in January, 1888, was made bankrupt in the High Court, receiving his discharge under the latter proceedings in the following April, subject to a suspension of two years. He attributed his present failure to losses on contracts during the last four years. The creditors include:—

Willismer & Coe, Hoe Street, Walthamstow 100 9 4
The matter remained in the hands of the Official Receiver to be wound up in bankruptcy, Mr. Hough intimating that, in his opinion, the transactions between the debtor and Mr. Punnett required investigation. The public examination is fixed for February 7th.
PASCO, JAS. FREDERICK, builder, of 29, Trinity Road, Upper Tooting, S.W.—On Saturday Mr. Alexander Mackintosh, Official Receiver of the Wandsworth district, issued particulars of this failure, under receiving order dated November 27th last. The debtor has been adjudicated bankrupt and an order has been made by the Court for the summary administration of the estate. The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition. The delay in calling the meeting of creditors has been caused by the fact (the Official Receiver says) that the bankrupt did not furnish him with a list of creditors until December 21st, and that no statement of affairs has yet been lodged by him. The bankrupt states that he is unable to prepare the same himself, and, there being no assets at the present time in the estate, the Official Receiver has not considered himself justified in authorising the employment of an accountant to assist him. The debtor states that he commenced business as a builder at his present address about fourteen months ago, with a capital of about £30, his savings. His unsecured liabilities are said to amount to about £325. The bankrupt appears to have entered into a building agreement with a Mr. Darby to erect seven houses at Balham, but owing to the levying of an execution the freeholder entered into possession in August last, and it is due to this, as well as to inability to see the work properly finished and to raise money on mortgage, that the bankrupt attributes his insolvency. He became aware of his insolvency in August last, when he ceased to work. He has kept a cash book, creditors' ledger, invoice book.
PESKETT, JAS. and GEORGE AYLING, builders, Horsham.—The first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday, at Horsham, before Mr. Howard W. Cox, Official Receiver. The liabilities amount to £262 17s. 9d., and assets £118 18s. 7d. The alleged causes of failure are under-estimating and bad debts, illness, and deaths of families. The debtors filed their own petition, and had been adjudicated bankrupts. They commenced business in June, 1891, having a capital of £50, put in by Ayling. The business has not been sufficient to maintain two families. No proper books have been kept. There being no offer, the Official Receiver was appointed trustee. Principal creditors:—
