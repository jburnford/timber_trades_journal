The Caledonian shows an increase for the week of £1,031, and for the 23 weeks of this half-year an increase of £8,270. The Highland shows for the week of £1,031, and for the 23 weeks of the half year an increase of £2,270.\n\nNEW WORKS AT AYR.\n\nA full account description of the new electric lighting plant at Ayr, the Contract for which was given out in April last, having been invited for the erection of the plant, building, &c., no less than 48 were received. Some of the tenders were for the whole work, but these were rejected, and the work was divided into different parts only. The lowest offer received for the or complete work was £12,000, while the lowest offers from the various tradesmen for the different parts of the work amounted to £11,834. Considering that a further sum could be saved by dividing the work into sections, the committee felt justified in adopting this course, and the tenders accepted were as follow :—\n\nPlant.\nBoiler-house plant: Messrs. P. & W. Maclellan & Co., Glasgow, £950.\nPiping, &c., in connection with boiler-house plant: to be undertaken under the superintendence of Mr. Hammond and Mr. Pink at a cost of £800.\nEngine-house plant: Messrs. Willans & Robinson, Limited, London, £2,200.\nSwitchboards and instruments, 1 arc lamps, posts, &c.: Messrs. Fowler & Co., Limited, Leeds, £1,130.\nCables and culverts: Callender's Bitumen Telegraph and Waterproof Company, Limited, London, £1,842 18s. 9d.\nTransformers and boxes: Messrs.

W. Highet & Son, Ayr, £356 10s.\n\nIt is well to state that the original prices in the tenders do not include extras which have inevitably to be incurred.\nOne extra in particular is worthy of notice.\nIt is the sum of £990 12s. 6d. which will be involved in an extension of the main along Miller Road and Alloway Street, a district not included in the original area to be lighted.\nThe figures given above, exclusive of site, plant, and buildings, but inclusive of the extra sum for the extension of the main referred to, total up £19,074 8s. 1d.\nThis sum, of course, does not include the architect's fee nor the salaries of the superintendents appointed to look after the erection of the plant and buildings.\nAnother item to add is the unexpended sum of £15,000 which the Corporation were authorised to borrow for a previous scheme.\nTaking all these items into account, along with the extras, the total cost may be estimated at over £40,000.\nRecently the Commissioners have been empowered to borrow an additional £10,000, bringing the amount borrowed up to £35,000.\nDesigns for the building were prepared by Mr. H. V. Eaglesham, architect, Ayr, who has also superintended the carrying out of the work.\nThe buildings are built of brick, lined inside with fire-clay brick of brick from Sanquhar.\nOn the ground floor are situated the engine-room, measuring 69 ft. by 34 ft., and 41 ft. high to the apex of the roof; the boiler-room, 69 ft. by 33 ft., and 33 ft. high; the condenser-room, 33 ft. by 16 ft.; the test-room, 17 ft. by 16 ft.; coal-sheds, 69 ft. by 25 ft. by 16 ft. high; mess-room, 10 ft. by 9 ft. by 16 ft.; lavatory, water-closet, &c.\nUpstairs are the offices, switch-board gallery, &c.\n\nJANUARY 11, 1896.\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nTelegrams—“Mackellar, Gallowgate, Glasgow.”\nMackellar & Macphee, Timber Merchants and Saw-millers,\nCENTRAL SAW-MILLS, GALLOWGATE,\nMahogany, Birch, Walnut, Ash, &c.
