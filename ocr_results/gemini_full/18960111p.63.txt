NEW WORKS AT AYR.

A full account description of the new electric lighting plant at Ayr, the Contract for which was given out in April last, having been invited for the erection of the plant, building, &c., no less than 48 were received. Some of the tenders were for the whole work, but these were rejected, and the work was divided into different parts only. The lowest offer received for the or complete work was £12,000, while the lowest offers from the various tradesmen for the different parts of the work amounted to £11,834. Considering that a further sum could be saved by dividing the work into sections, the committee felt justified in adopting this course, and the tenders accepted were as follow :—

Plant.
Boiler-house plant: Messrs. P. & W. Maclellan & Co., Glasgow, £950.
Piping, &c., in connection with boiler-house plant: to be undertaken under the superintendence of Mr. Hammond and Mr. Pink at a cost of £800.
Engine-house plant: Messrs. Willans & Robinson, Limited, London, £2,200.
Switchboards and instruments, 1 arc lamps, posts, &c.: Messrs. Fowler & Co., Limited, Leeds, £1,130.
Cables and culverts: Callender's Bitumen Telegraph and Waterproof Company, Limited, London, £1,842 18s. 9d.
Transformers and boxes: Messrs. Lowrie & Co., Limited, Teddington, £225.
Travelling crane, &c.: Messrs. Carrick & Ritchie, Edinburgh, £192 10s.

Buildings.
Brick, and mason's work: Mr. Robert Beck, Ayr, £3,303 6s. 4d.
Joiner, and painter's work: Mr. Robert Milligan, Ayr, £1,148 13s. 4d.
Iron and slater's work: Messrs. W. Highet & Son, Ayr, £356 10s.

It is well to state that the original prices in the tenders do not include extras which have inevitably to be incurred.
One extra in particular is worthy of notice.
It is the sum of £990 12s. 6d. which will be involved in an extension of the main along Miller Road and Alloway Street, a district not included in the original area to be lighted.
The figures given above, exclusive of site, plant, and buildings, but inclusive of the extra sum for the extension of the main referred to, total up £19,074 8s. 1d.
This sum, of course, does not include the architect's fee nor the salaries of the superintendents appointed to look after the erection of the plant and buildings.
Another item to add is the unexpended sum of £15,000 which the Corporation were authorised to borrow for a previous scheme.
Taking all these items into account, along with the extras, the total cost may be estimated at over £40,000.
Recently the Commissioners have been empowered to borrow an additional £10,000, bringing the amount borrowed up to £35,000.
Designs for the building were prepared by Mr. H. V. Eaglesham, architect, Ayr, who has also superintended the carrying out of the work.
The buildings are built of brick, lined inside with fire-clay brick of brick from Sanquhar.
On the ground floor are situated the engine-room, measuring 69 ft. by 34 ft., and 41 ft. high to the apex of the roof; the boiler-room, 69 ft. by 33 ft., and 33 ft. high; the condenser-room, 33 ft. by 16 ft.; the test-room, 17 ft. by 16 ft.; coal-sheds, 69 ft. by 25 ft. by 16 ft. high; mess-room, 10 ft. by 9 ft. by 16 ft.; lavatory, water-closet, &c.
Upstairs are the offices, switch-board gallery, &c.

BUILDING NEWS.
We shall be pleased to receive items of news concerning new works, &c., from any of our readers in Stirling or Inverness engaged in the timber or building trades.
* * *
The Deer District Committee of the Aberdeenshire County Council having debated the question of a central hospital at Strichen, decided to send the whole matter back to committee.
* * *
During last year a considerable number of buildings were erected in Alloa, and a few others are in course of erection.
This may be regarded as a good sign for the future of the place.
* * *
Stirling did well last year, there being a good deal of building going on during all the twelve months.
The prospects for the year upon which we have entered are bright.
Perhaps the most important of the public buildings completed in 1895 was the new Post Office.
* * *
Briskness has, for some time, characterised the building trade of Inverness, and buildings to the value of nearly £80,000 were completed.
Several excellent improvements have been carried out in the central portion of the town, and other public works have been mooted.
* * *
Plans are invited for a public hall to be erected at Edzell, and to be known as “The Inglis Memorial Hall.”
Full details as to site and the accommodation required will be supplied on application to Mr. John Shiel, solicitor, Brechin, to whom all communications should be addressed.
The total cost must not exceed £2,500, and the author of the plan selected will have the carrying out of the work.
Plans must be lodged with Mr. John Shiel by February 15th.
* * *
Considerable alterations and additions, including the erection of a new chapel, have been completed at the Little Sisters’ Home, Union Street, Greenock.
The result is the provision of accommodation for thirty more inmates, and the erection of a place of worship suited to the requirements of the institution.
The chapel, which has a gallery, is seated for over 200 persons, and has cost about £2,000.

PORT INTELLIGENCE.
GREENOCK.
At the monthly meeting of the Harbour Trust on Wednesday, Provost Shankland, in wishing members the compliments of the season, stated that the past year had been a successful one, and that there was reason to hope that, if business went on in the ordinary course, and was not interfered with by wars outside or strikes inside the country, the current year would be equally if not more prosperous.
He took occasion to refer to statements which had been made with respect to the entrance to James Watt Dock.
He stated that the channelway was 180 ft. wide and 30 ft. deep at high water, and that there was no possible danger in any way to vessels going in or coming out of the dock.
There was absolutely no silting whatever in the basin.
MESSRS. WILLIAM DENNY & BROS., of Leven Shipyard, are proceeding with the order to build fifteen large barges for service in Russia.
Of these, five will be constructed by their neighbours, Messrs. A. M'Millan & Son (Limited), the Dockyard.
This order comes very opportunely, and with the work already booked will place Dumbarton in a good position.
