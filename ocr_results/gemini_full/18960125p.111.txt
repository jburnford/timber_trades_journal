FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases
creditors whose names are published in these lists
hold security for their debts, sometimes for the
full amount.]
BENNETT, ALFRED, & CO., bil-
liard-table makers, Plymouth.--The Official
Receiver for the Plymouth district has now
issued particulars under this failure, from which
it appears that the debtors have filed a state-
ment of affairs showing gross liabilities
amounting to £4,828, of which £1,719 is
expected to rank against the estate for dividend.
The assets are estimated to produce £507, thus
leaving a deficiency amounting to £1,212. The
debtors allege their failure to have been caused
through pressure by creditors and want of
capital. The first meeting of the creditors
interested under this failure took place at the
offices of the Official Receiver, Plymouth, on
