Stevenson & Co., of Glasgow and Leith, have issued their annual circular on the exports of coal from Scotland. They give the total for 1895 (excluding shipments to places in the United Kingdom, which are not technically exports) as 4,706,860 tons, as compared with 3,359,938 tons in 1894, with 4,604,503 tons in 1893, and with 4,934,054 tons in 1892—the last normal year. They have taken 1892 as the basis for comparisons, as in 1893 the great strike in the Midlands caused a reduction of exports and a large increase in coastwise shipments for the supply of the English market, and in 1894 the strike in Scotland reduced supplies to such an extent that exports fell, in the seven months of that year, 27 per cent. Other figures show that, in the normal year of 1892, of 29,000,000 tons exported from Great Britain, 24,000,000 were shipped by England and Wales. In 1893 the Midland strike fully taxed their resources to meet the home demand for exports, but the moment they got their house in order they set about recovering lost ground in the most thorough manner, and this to such good purpose that in 1894, while Scotland's exports fell fully a fourth, they not only regained their loss but increased their exports by 4,000,000 tons over 1892.\n\nROBERT KERR & SONS,\nESTABLISHED 1859.\nGLENGARNOCK near BEITH, N.B\nGENERAL ENGINEERS,\nMakers of Wood-working Machinery\nOF EVERY DESCRIPTION\nFor Saw-mills, Joiners, Cabinet Makers and Chair Manufacturers, &c.\n\nJohn Pollock's Patent Automatic Wood Carving Machines,\nSOLE MAKERS.\n\nA. & W.
