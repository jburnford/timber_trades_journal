BUILDING NEWS.
The plans for the new academy at Kilmarnock have been returned by the Department, and only a very few minor alterations have been suggested. The cost of the new building is about £12,000.
Mr. Hislop, gas manager to the Paisley Corporation, has reported that the time has arrived when considerable extensions must be made to the manufacturing and distributing gas plant. He estimates the cost of such additions at £20,494.
The Greenock School Board have decided that the new school in Nelson Street be similar in material and workmanship to the Hillend School, that the cost be not more than £10,000, and that Mr. J. B. Stewart, architect, Greenock, be appointed to draw up schedules and carry out the work.
Mr. W. B. Copland, C.E., has drawn up a report as to the provision of an additional reservoir at Kirkintilloch. The report provides for a supply for 18,000 people at a cost of £9,000, exclusive of cost of land and wayleave damages. The matter has been remitted to the Water Committee to procure information as to the cost of land.
The northern part of St. Mary's (Established) Church at Dumfries is to be reconstructed, and the organ removed to the east side. The roof is also opened so as to increase the head-room by about 15 ft., and other alterations will be effected, the probable cost being £2,025. The plans have been approved by the congregation.

SCOTCH COAL EXPORTS.
Messrs. D. M. Stevenson & Co., of Glasgow and Leith, have issued their annual circular on the exports of coal from Scotland. They give the total for 1895 (excluding shipments to places in the United Kingdom, which are not technically exports) as 4,706,860 tons, as compared with 3,359,938 tons in 1894, with 4,604,503 tons in 1893, and with 4,934,054 tons in 1892—the last normal year. They have taken 1892 as the basis for comparisons, as in 1893 the great strike in the Midlands caused a reduction of exports and a large increase in coastwise shipments for the supply of the English market, and in 1894 the strike in Scotland reduced supplies to such an extent that exports fell, in the seven months of that year, 27 per cent. Other figures show that, in the normal year of 1892, of 29,000,000 tons exported from Great Britain, 24,000,000 were shipped by England and Wales. In 1893 the Midland strike fully taxed their resources to meet the home demand for exports, but the moment they got their house in order they set about recovering lost ground in the most thorough manner, and this to such good purpose that in 1894, while Scotland's exports fell fully a fourth, they not only regained their loss but increased their exports by 4,000,000 tons over 1892.
