FENTON, M. C., builder, Kent.—This debtor made an application for his discharge at the last sitting of the Rochester Bankruptcy Court, before Judge Selfe.—His Honour said the debtor's discharge would be granted, subject to his consenting to judgment being entered against him for £100, to be satisfied at the rate of £4 per month.
GIDDONS, W., & MORGAN, builders, Chorley, Lancashire.—These debtors appeared for their public examination at the last sitting of the Bolton Bankruptcy Court before the Registrar, when, in the course of their replies to questions put by the Official Receiver they stated that they commenced business with a capital of £110. Finally it was decided to adjourn the examination until the next court.
HOMERSHAM, OSBORN & SMOULTON (trading as Homersham & Co.), builder, S. Fern Crescent, Perry Street, Gravesend, formerly of Galley Hill, Swanscombe, Kent.—The debtor appeared for his examination at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Hayward, when Mr. R. T. Latham, Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade. The deficiency was only £125, and the debtor, who filed his own petition, attributed his failure to insufficient trade to meet expenses. In June, 1892, he executed a deed of assignment, and a small dividend was paid to crepitors. The examination was adjourned, the debtor being ordered to file a deficiency account.

Inskip, builders, for his mother at a salary of £5 per week. When that business was discontinued he was perfectly solvent. He had negotiated two bills of £25 for his brother Daniel, who carried on business at Hanley as a brickworks, and these were met by his brother Thomas on his behalf. He received no consideration for the bills himself, but accepted them simply to help his brother Daniel. Eventually it was decided to adjourn the examination until the sitting of the Court, on January 28th.
