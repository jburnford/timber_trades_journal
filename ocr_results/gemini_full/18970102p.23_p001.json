Ld. ; Allison, Couesland & Co. ; and Cant & Kemp.\nIt amounts to 5,000 loads.\nThe trade in sawn oak planks, scantlings, and boards has become of considerable importance ; the aggregate import for the past year was about 19,000 loads, the bulk of which was on contract and brought forward in parcels per liners from the States, arriving weekly throughout the year.\nOf States oak in log, the yearly import to Glasgow is only some five or six hundred loads.\nWalnut and Canary whitewood form considerable items in the imports, per these steamers, from the States, though small as compared with the sawn oak imports.\nCanary whitewood during the past year has been imported to the amount of about 4,800 loads, hewn and sawn, and walnut about 1,400 loads.\nThe arrival at Yorkhill of the \"Concordia\"\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nSCOTCH SECTION.\n\nSINGLETON, DUNN & CO.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n27, UNION STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegram Address—\n\"SINGLETONS, GLASGOW.\"\n\nEDMISTON & MITCHELLS,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n33, Renfield Street, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\n\"EDMISTON, GLASGOW.\"\n\nTHOMSON & GRAY,\nTEAK IMPORTERS,\n40, WEST NILE STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"TEAK, GLASGOW.\"\n\nA. & C.

Buchanan & French; also deals, chiefly spruce, about 800 loads, for Messrs. Allison, Couesland, & Co.\nDeliveries to some extent are taking place ex quay, the rest being yarded.\nThe \"Alcides\" (s), from St. John, N.B., is due within the next day or two, and is reported to have a shipment of 375 St. Petersburg standards deals, and 180 loads timber.\nA steady trade has been done in spruce deals for a lengthened period, and there is the prospect of a continued good demand and firm prices.\nDuring the past year the imports of spruce deals to Glasgow have been something over 10,000 St. Petersburg standards, which have been largely absorbed by deliveries to the consumers, stocks in first hand being kept in moderate compass.\nAmongst the imports in the list for the past week will be observed a parcel of 50 logs mahogany per \"Prussian\" (s), from Boston, consigned to Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells.\nThese arrivals of mahogany in the round have, during the past year, shown a marked increase, the amount for the year being 1,139 logs, and the consignments as they came forward from time to time have been promptly taken up by consumers ex quay at good prices.\nSome parcels of oak, walnut, whitewood, ash, hickory, &c., have just arrived per \"Hestia\" (s), from Baltimore, and had at Queen's Dock, not included in\n\nRobert Hamilton & Co.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n75, ST.
