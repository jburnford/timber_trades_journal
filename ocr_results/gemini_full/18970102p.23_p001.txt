TRADE REPORTS.

GLASGOW.
There is little to add since last writing, as at this time of year with the holidays coming on transactions are curtailed very much.
The Caledonian Railway Company's contract for their supply of oak planks and scantlings for the year now beginning, has been fixed, and is allotted amongst the following firms:—James Kennedy & Co. ; Edmiston & Mitchells ; Brownlee & Co. Ld. ; Allison, Couesland & Co. ; and Cant & Kemp.
It amounts to 5,000 loads.
The trade in sawn oak planks, scantlings, and boards has become of considerable importance ; the aggregate import for the past year was about 19,000 loads, the bulk of which was on contract and brought forward in parcels per liners from the States, arriving weekly throughout the year.
Of States oak in log, the yearly import to Glasgow is only some five or six hundred loads.
Walnut and Canary whitewood form considerable items in the imports, per these steamers, from the States, though small as compared with the sawn oak imports.
Canary whitewood during the past year has been imported to the amount of about 4,800 loads, hewn and sawn, and walnut about 1,400 loads.

(s), from St. John, N.B., was referred to last week.
The cargo comprised 155 loads birch logs and a quantity of birch planks to Messrs. Buchanan & French; also deals, chiefly spruce, about 800 loads, for Messrs. Allison, Couesland, & Co.
Deliveries to some extent are taking place ex quay, the rest being yarded.
The "Alcides" (s), from St. John, N.B., is due within the next day or two, and is reported to have a shipment of 375 St. Petersburg standards deals, and 180 loads timber.
A steady trade has been done in spruce deals for a lengthened period, and there is the prospect of a continued good demand and firm prices.
During the past year the imports of spruce deals to Glasgow have been something over 10,000 St. Petersburg standards, which have been largely absorbed by deliveries to the consumers, stocks in first hand being kept in moderate compass.
Amongst the imports in the list for the past week will be observed a parcel of 50 logs mahogany per "Prussian" (s), from Boston, consigned to Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells.
These arrivals of mahogany in the round have, during the past year, shown a marked increase, the amount for the year being 1,139 logs, and the consignments as they came forward from time to time have been promptly taken up by consumers ex quay at good prices.
Some parcels of oak, walnut, whitewood, ash, hickory, &c., have just arrived per "Hestia" (s), from Baltimore, and had at Queen's Dock, not included in

The arrivals during the week consist of the following:—26,907 pcs poplar, per "Aldborough" (s), from Newport News; 7,075 battens per "Calabria" (s), from Riga; 1,414 oak staves per "Savona" (s), from Danzig; 389 bdls poplar, per "Aldebaran" (s), from New York; 203 boards and 431 bdls poplar per "Govino" (s), from Baltimore; 584 oak staves, per "Croft" (s), from Copenhagen; and 26,907 oak staves per "Dresden" (s), from Libau.
Since last report there is nothing new to record in the way of business, and there will be a complete stoppage for the first week of the new year as usual.
The importation of wood goods for the past year, it is estimated, will not exceed 15 per cent. over that of 1895, and as the stocks in hand are very much the same as at this date last year, the excess must represent increased consumption.
