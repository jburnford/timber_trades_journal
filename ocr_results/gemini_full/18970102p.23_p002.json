Mr. Hamilton Beattie, architect, stated that the petitioners intended to erect four-storey tenements, containing 215 houses, twenty-five being of four apartments, forty-six of three apartments, and 144 of two apartments, and altogether 215 houses providing accommodation for 1,075 occupants, or about 10 per cent. more than the number that was to be displaced. These new houses were to be erected at Halmyre Street and Lorne Street, about 300 yards from the property which was to be demolished.\n\nTHOS HARRIS & SON,\nKINESS PARK SAW-MILLS,\nST.
