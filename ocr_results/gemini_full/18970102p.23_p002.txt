BUILDING NEWS.
The Banff Amenities Committee are about to erect an iron railing along the top of the Braeheads, in front of the houses, and cover the walks there with gravel; to make a walk on the battery green with steps at the west end—three seats to be provided at certain points; to erect three seats on the Seabraes; to erect two bathing-sheds; to repair the well on the Seabrae, and also the walk.

A movement has been set on foot for the erection of a hospital for incurables at Dundee, and a public meeting will be held at an early date to consider the question. There is at present a fund in hand of £4,000.

The Edinburgh Town Council have approved the plans of the new hospital buildings, and the Public Health Committee are to obtain estimates.

New public schools are being erected at Greenock to accommodate between 800 and 900 children at a cost of about £14,000. Mr. Jas. B. Stewart is the architect.

Besides a statue of the Queen Dundee is now aiming at founding a home for incurables at a probable cost of £50,000, as a memorial of Her Majesty's long reign.

Plans of seventeen new buildings in Aberdeen were sanctioned last week, the estimated value of the property being upwards of £20,000.

The Aberdeen Town Council have accepted tenders for the erection of the new Corporation lodging-house, the cost of which will be between £10,000 and £11,000.

NORTH-BRITISH RAILWAY EXTENSIONS IN LEITH.—Sheriff Rutherfurd, in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, has held an inquiry in regard to the proposal of the North British Railway Company to demolish property in Ferrier Street, Gordon Street, and Duke Street in connection with the making of the new line to Leith at the foot of Leith Walk, and as the result of a house-to-house inquiry, it had been ascertained that in the property which it was proposed to demolish, and which was occupied by the labouring classes, there were thirty-six separate buildings, containing 243 apartments, with 909 occupants. Mr. Hamilton Beattie, architect, stated that the petitioners intended to erect four-storey tenements, containing 215 houses, twenty-five being of four apartments, forty-six of three apartments, and 144 of two apartments, and altogether 215 houses providing accommodation for 1,075 occupants, or about 10 per cent. more than the number that was to be displaced. These new houses were to be erected at Halmyre Street and Lorne Street, about 300 yards from the property which was to be demolished.
