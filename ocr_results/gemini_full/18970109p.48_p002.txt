FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BULL, FREDERICK.—This debtor, described as of Hill House, 101, Hill Lane, Shirley, Southampton, formerly builder and contractor, but now out of business, filed his own petition, through Mr. Bell, on the 7th December, a receiving order being made, and the debtor at the same time being adjudicated bankrupt. The alleged causes of failure are bad trade, heavy losses, and long illness. The debtor, until two years ago, was one of the managing directors of Joseph Bull, Sons, & Co., Limited, builders, and before that was a partner in the firm of Messrs. Joseph Bull & Sons, which became bankrupt owing to losses arising from the building of the Law Courts in London. For the last two years he has been without occupation. His gross liabilities, all of which rank for dividend, amount to £310 8s. 3d., and the assets are returned as nil. Mr. C. Martin appeared for the debtor, at the Southampton Court, the other day, when he was allowed to pass his examination.

LACEY, W. R., builder and contractor, Barking.—This debtor made an application for annulment of his bankruptcy at the Chelmsford Bankruptcy Court on Monday on the ground that he had paid his debts in full. His Honour said he should adjourn the application, provided the debtor paid the costs of the day by January 15th, and if they were not paid by that day the application would be dismissed.

ROBINSON, GEORGE, joiner and builder, Stanley, near Liverpool, late Ranelagh Road, Liverpool. This debtor came up for his public examination at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week, before Mr. Registrar Cooper. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he now resided at Stanley, near Liverpool. By trade he was a joiner, but six years ago he commenced business as a building repairer in Ranelagh Road, Liverpool. Eventually the examination was adjourned.
