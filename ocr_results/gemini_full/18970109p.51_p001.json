By Monday, however, trade will have resumed its ordinary course. It is satisfactory to note that the industrial outlook is cheerful, there being a more than average amount of work on hand, and some of our large works, shipyards, saw-mills, &c., have shortened the usual holiday on account of the briskness that prevails. The official statement of vessels under construction in the various Clyde shipbuilding districts is as follows—viz., at December 31, 1896, Glasgow, 175,690 tons; Greenock, 81,814 tons, and at December 31, 1895, the figures were Glasgow, 144,098 tons, and Greenock, 73,080 tons. The foregoing is irrespective of warship tonnage, the amount of which stated as at present under construction in the various Clyde districts, is about 69,000 tons.\nA comparative statement of the stocks of wood goods at Greenock and Glasgow was given in your last number.\nThe figures representing the trade in pitch pine for the year are specially noteworthy. The aggregate stock at December 31st, 1895, was 34,917 loads, and at December 31st, 1896, 25,892 loads, while the import for the year has amounted to 47,758 loads, showing\n\nRobert Hamilton & Co.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n75, ST.

Edmiston & Mitchells. This market is bare of mahogany, and a strong demand and good prices may be counted on for early cargoes directed here. The Greenock imports for the week consist of a cargo of teak, and one of greenheart; a considerable proportion of the teak cargo, which is consigned to Messrs. Allison, Cousland & Co., has, we learn, been disposed of.\n\nGREENOCK.\nThe \"Ruth,\" from Demerara, arrived here on \"Hogmanay,\" with a cargo of 356 logs greenheart timber—mostly piling sizes—and is being discharged at James Watt Dock. This cargo is on account of Messrs. James McLean & Co., Greenock Patent Sawmills.\n\nJAMES KENNEDY & CO.\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchants,\n69, BUCHANAN STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\n\"LIGNUM, GLASGOW.\"\n\nLOVE & STEWART,\nPitwood Importers & Coal Exporters,\n140, HOPE STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\n\"LOVART.\"\nTelephone No. 3081\n\nLOVE & FIFE,\nENGINEERS,\nWOOD-WORKING MACHINERY\nOf every Description.\nBEITH.\n\nRENNIE, BRYSON & Co\nPitwood Importers,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchar[?],\n128, HOPE STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegrams, \"SPRUCE.\"\nTelephone No. 424\n\nJOHN CAMPBELL,\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\nINVERNESS.\nAlways on hand, a Large and Varied Stock of\nMINING and COLLIERY TIMBER in Larch and\nScots Fir.

In the way of arrivals there is nothing to report except 7,955 deals and battens per \"Moravia\" (s) from Riga, which port still continues open, and further shipments of wood goods are likely to come forward from there by succeeding steamers, so long as the ice permits.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nDec. 31 Foerder (s)-Skien-99 lds. staves-Cook & Co.; 11 lds. firewood-Dunn Bros.\n\nBO'NESS.\nDec. 29 Constance (s)-Gothenburg-600 lds. props-Stevenson & Cowie\n\nGLASGOW.\nDec. 29 Norwegian-New York-2,922 bhd. staves-Wright, Graham, & Co.; 1 1/2 cars lumber, 24 maple logs\nDec. 30 Hestia-Baltimore-790 pcs. oak-Brownlee & Co; 985 pcs., 48 logs oak-Cant & Kemp; 238 pcs. oak, 197 pcs. pine-Allison, Cousland & Co.",
