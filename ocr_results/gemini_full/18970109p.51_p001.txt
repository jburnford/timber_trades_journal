TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
Owing to the New Year's holidays the past week, as regards business, has been a quiet one, with little calling for remark. By Monday, however, trade will have resumed its ordinary course. It is satisfactory to note that the industrial outlook is cheerful, there being a more than average amount of work on hand, and some of our large works, shipyards, saw-mills, &c., have shortened the usual holiday on account of the briskness that prevails. The official statement of vessels under construction in the various Clyde shipbuilding districts is as follows—viz., at December 31, 1896, Glasgow, 175,690 tons; Greenock, 81,814 tons, and at December 31, 1895, the figures were Glasgow, 144,098 tons, and Greenock, 73,080 tons. The foregoing is irrespective of warship tonnage, the amount of which stated as at present under construction in the various Clyde districts, is about 69,000 tons.
A comparative statement of the stocks of wood goods at Greenock and Glasgow was given in your last number.
The figures representing the trade in pitch pine for the year are specially noteworthy. The aggregate stock at December 31st, 1895, was 34,917 loads, and at December 31st, 1896, 25,892 loads, while the import for the year has amounted to 47,758 loads, showing

that deliveries to consumers have been 56,783 loads, a total which exceeds that of any year hitherto.
The year's import of pitch pine above mentioned has been by 23 vessels, a number of which were large steamers; aggregate tonnage, 33,435 tons (all arriving at Greenock).
The principal item in the Glasgow imports for the past week is a consignment of spruce deals, birch logs and planks, &c., per "Alcides" (s), from St. John, N.B., which has been in course of discharge at Yorkhill.
The parcel of round mahogany per "Prussian" (s), arrival of which was recently referred to, has been disposed of ex quay by Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells. This market is bare of mahogany, and a strong demand and good prices may be counted on for early cargoes directed here. The Greenock imports for the week consist of a cargo of teak, and one of greenheart; a considerable proportion of the teak cargo, which is consigned to Messrs. Allison, Cousland & Co., has, we learn, been disposed of.

GREENOCK.
The "Ruth," from Demerara, arrived here on "Hogmanay," with a cargo of 356 logs greenheart timber—mostly piling sizes—and is being discharged at James Watt Dock. This cargo is on account of Messrs. James McLean & Co., Greenock Patent Sawmills.

As usual at this season, the public works in town are shut for the holidays, and do not resume till Monday, the 11th current.

LEITH.
The opening week of the new year has, as anticipated, been a very quiet one, many of the joiners not resuming work until the middle of the week, and consequently the deliveries of wood have been on a limited scale, but if the weather continues favourable, business should resume its normal activity by next week. In the way of arrivals there is nothing to report except 7,955 deals and battens per "Moravia" (s) from Riga, which port still continues open, and further shipments of wood goods are likely to come forward from there by succeeding steamers, so long as the ice permits.
