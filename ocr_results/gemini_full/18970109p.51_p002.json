ALLISON, COUSLAND & CO.\nThe year just finished has witnessed a remarkable activity in the timber trade.\nImports all round were heavy, but there was an excellent demand, and stocks were rapidly worked off at satisfactory prices.\nThe season opened with freights about last year's figures, and the imports were heavy, but with a sharp advance in September they were gradually curtailed, thereby materially strengthening the position of stocks on hand.\nPrices showed a steady and continuous rise from the beginning to the end of the year, and we think the results of the year's working should be satisfactory to all concerned.\nSeveral features of outstanding interest fall to be noted.\nThe gradual displacement of yellow pine in the log, and the expansion of the trade in deals and boards, are very noticeable.\nThe position of teak also calls for remark.\nIt was sold in January at £8 15s., and the price now is £12 5s.\nQuite a feature also was the number of small contracts entered into on account of Canadian shippers, the benefits from which were very questionable.\nHousebuilding and shipbuilding being our principal wood-consuming industries, the timber trade participated in the activity which characterised these trades throughout the year.\nOur shipbuilders launched a mated value of £9,000,000 as compared with 360,152 tons, valued at £8,220,000 in 1895.\nThe work on hand is estimated at 300,000 tons, as against 225,000 at this date last year.\nThe trades were also free from the now constantly-recurring labour disputes, the outlook for the incoming year is very promising, and should be no less satisfactory than that just finished.\nD.

SINGLETON, DUNN, & CO.\nThe timber trade in the West of Scotland during 1896 has been fairly satisfactory, and in volume is considerably ahead of former years.\nThe consumption on all hands has been large, as all the chief industries have been well employed—housebuilding, shipbuilding, and engineering especially.\nThe stock was small when the importing season commenced, and to begin with only moderate shipments came to hand, but in midsummer came usual supplies of wood goods from the St. Lawrence to come to this market, and but for the very decided advance in freights during the last months of the season curtailing shipments the condition of this market would have been less favourable than it now is.\nFor the year just begun all the indications point to a continuance of healthy business, as the amount of work on hand will give steady employment during 1897 to those engaged in the leading industries affecting the timber trade.\nMESSRS. CANT & KEMP.\nThe past year has been noted for the large volume of business which has been transacted, and the gradual advance which has taken place in the price of those woods which are most largely consumed in this market, and the good prospect for the spring months, with which the year closes.\nNearly all round the returns of the stocks in the Clyde show very reasonable quantities of the various items to be on hand.\nThis is more noticeable in such items as Quebec pine deals, and, generally speaking, all Quebec goods of prime quality.\nPitch pine has also shared in the large consumption which has been going on, and the stock to-day is less than it has been for three years.\nTeak has advanced very materially in price, and is very firmly held, whilst it is reported that shipments for some time to come will be on a very moderate scale.\nShipbuilders have had a very good year, so far as output is concerned, there having been no less than about 420,000 tons launched during 1896, as compared with 360,000 tons for the previous year, whilst the work on hand will give steady employment for some months yet, very considerable contracts having been recently entered into.\nRolling stock manufacturers, builders, and cabinetmakers continue well employed.\nROBERT KERR & SONS.\nESTABLISHED 1859.\nGLENGARNOCK near BEITH, N.B.\nGENERAL ENGINEERS,\nMakers of Wood-working Machinery\nOF EVERY DESCRIPTION\nFor Saw-mills, Joiners, Cabinet Makers and Chair Manufacturers, &c.\nSOLE MAKERS OF\nJohn Pollock's Patent Automatic Wood Carving Machines.\nA. & W.
