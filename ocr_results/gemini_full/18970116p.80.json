EDMISTON & MITCHELLS.\nThe past year has been an exceptionally\nbright one for the timber trade in all its\nbranches. The shipbuilding on the Clyde\nhas been very brisk, and owing to the open\nwinter of 1895-96 housebuilding was carried\non almost without interruption during the\nearly spring, and a large number of new\ncontracts were started during the summer\nand autumn months. Both of these in-\ndustries, on which the timber trade is\nlargely dependent, are at present in a very\nhealthy condition, and we anticipate a good\ntrade for next year. Prices of nearly all\nclasses of timber and deals have remained\nsteady, and latterly have improved con-\nsiderably, and the year closes with stocks\nwell held, and prospects of a further\nadvance in values. The imports of yellow\npine, red pine, elm, ash, and birch have\nall exceeded that of 1895, but as the\nconsumption has been good, the stocks of\nthese are light, except waney pine and ash.\nThe import of oak is 500 logs less than in\n1895, and the stock is very light, and really\nfirst-class timber is scarce. The trade in\ncut timber continues on a large scale, and\nalthough this year's import exceeded last\nyear's by about 520,000 pieces, the total\nstock of deals and planks of all kinds is\nonly 1,400 standards more than at this time\nlast year, and is more than accounted for by\nthe increase in pine planks, Lower Port\npine deals, and fourth quality Quebec\npine, which together amount to 2,000\nstandards over last year. First, second,\nand third quality pine are in good demand,\nand top prices are being realised for them.\nThe year 1896 has been a record one in the\n\nBUCHANAN & FRENCH,\nTimber Importers, Merchants and Saw-millers,\nAlbert Saw-mills, RENFREW,\nAnd 52, St. Enoch Square, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address, \"WAINSCOT.\"\nTelephone: 5161, GLASGOW. 8, RENFREW.\n\nD.

JANUARY 16, 1897.\n\nshipbuilding industry on the Clyde, the\namount of tonnage launched aggregating\nfully 420,000 tons, which tops all past years,\nand exceeds 1895 by 60,000 tons. The\ndispute with the engineers, which retarded\nwork at the end of 1895, was happily settled\nat the beginning of this year, and the trade\nhas steadily improved since then. The\nmajority of our yards are now well employed,\nand will be for some months to come. The\ntotal work on hand at this date amounts to\nabout 310,000 tons, as against 260,000 tons\na year ago. The total value of this year's\noutput is about £9,000,000, as against\n£8,230,000 in 1895.\n\nFIRE AT PORT GLASGOW.\nOne of the most destructive fires that has\noccurred at Port Glasgow for many years\nbroke out on Wednesday morning in the\nshipbuilding yard of Messrs. William Hamil-\nton & Co. The buildings where the\nfire originated consisted of two long one-\nstorey buildings, each about 350 feet long,\nand comprised the joiner shop, the polishing\nshop, a store, and a sawmill, where the firm\ndid their own saw-milling.\nStrenuous efforts were made to prevent\nthe spread of the flames to the adjoining\nsaw-mill. This, however, was to little pur-\npose. The walls of the joiner shop, which\nwere of wood, were all ablaze, and soon the\nroof fell in with a crash, and this building\nand all its contents were a mass of burning\nruins.\nAbout two o'clock, when the fire was\nraging at its fiercest, it was feared that it\nmight spread to the large block of buildings\nforming the offices, moulding lofts, and\nmodel-makers' rooms. Five horses, which\nwere in the stables about 30 yards away,\nbecame restive, and were during the night\nremoved to a place of safety.\nHuge piles of deck planking were stacked\nalongside, and these had commenced to\nsteam with the heat. A pile of planking\nnear to the entrance to the sawmills also\ncaught fire, and the crane used at the saw-\nmill for loading and unloading timber was\nalso destroyed.\nThe buildings have been entirely burnt to\nthe ground, and their valuable contents have\nbeen utterly consumed, while the machinery\nis and shafting have been bent and twisted to\ndestruction. No accurate amount of damage\ncan meantime be ascertained, but it is\nestimated from £30,000 to £35,000, and is\ncovered by insurance.\nMuch delay is bound to be caused in\ngetting the fittings for the ships remade.\n\nDOCK BILLS.\nAmong the Bills lodged for consideration\nin the ensuing Session of Parliament, the\nBorrowstounness Town and Harbour Bill will,\namongst other things, empower the borough\ncommissioners to transfer their rights and\ninterests in the harbour and docks of\nBorrowstounness to the Caledonian Rail-\nway Company, and confer powers on that\ncompany in relation to the harbour and\ndocks.\nThe Clyde Navigation Bill will extend the\nperiods limited by the Clyde Navigation Act\nof 1894 for the compulsory purchase of\nlands and for the completion of the railway\nauthorised by the Clyde Navigation Act,\n1891.\nThe Kilpatrick Dock Bill is promoted by\nAlexander Wylie, John Macausland Denny,\nJohn Hay, W. F. Russell, James Donald,\nJohn Neilson, William Beardmore, and\nGeorge Burrell for the incorporation of a\ncompany with a capital of £150,000 and\n£50,000 borrowing powers to construct a\ntidal dock on the north side of the river\nClyde, near the light tower known as\nDonald's Quay Light, together with certain\nshort lines of railway.\nThe Stromness Harbour Bill is for the\nincorporation of commissioners to improve\nsome Harbour and the construction of new\nquays near the Commissioners' Quay and\nthe Warehouse Pier and Murray's Pier, and\nfor the construction of slipways, embank-\nments, &c. Power is taken to borrow\n£30,000.\n\nCONTRACTS OPEN.\nDRUMOAK (Aberdeen).—For the mason,\ncarpenter, slater, plasterer, and\nplumber's work of dwelling-house on the\nfarm of Sunnyside, Drumoak.

Then\nthe Corporation are preparing for the con-\nstruction of a new fever hospital at a mini-\nmum outlay of £250,000, while the cabling\nof the streets will necessitate a series of new\nsubway stations at various points in the\ncity. Another big undertaking will be\nthe building of the Usher Hall, when the\nTown Council have finally decided where\nMr. Usher's gift shall be placed, and there\nis besides the re-erection of the Council\nChambers, or at least such a structural\nre-arrangement as will be almost tantamount\nto a re-erection. The year has seen a\nfurther extension of the housing capacity of\nthe city, especially in the Morningside,\nMerchiston, and Murrayfield districts.\nAltogether the year has not only been an\nexceedingly prosperous one for the most\ninfluential trade in Edinburgh, but the\nprospects for the coming year are of the\nbrightest. There have been no wage dis-\nputes during 1896. The joiners were on\nstrike for a fortnight pending the re-arrange-\nment of their working rules. The matter\nwas compromised by concessions on both\nsides, and the men have been working away\nby the piece at the rate of 9½d. per hour, a\nconjunction of time and piece work which\nhas been found to work well. The granting\nof the Saturday half-holiday at the rate of\n9½d. per hour for fifty-one hours a week has\nexceeded the most sanguine expectations of\nreceiving a fair day's wage for a fair day's\nwork. The masons are paid at the rate of 9d.\nper hour for fifty-one hours a week. The\nburgh engineer's department and the Dean of\nGuild Court are preparing for a busy year.\nThe Heriot-Watt College, the Free Church\nLodge, the Royal Scottish Museum, and the\nScotia Skating Palace are among the larger\nbuildings which have been completed. The\n1,200 houses which it was estimated would\nbe required to meet the wants of the city\nstartling as the figures seemed, have been\nfully realised, and there is every prospect of\na similar demand being made during 1897.\nThe large number of tenements which have\nbeen erected have been almost entirely and\nfully let before they were completed, and\nthe latest returns show that there are fewer\nunlet houses in Edinburgh now than there were\non the same date last year.\n\nF.
