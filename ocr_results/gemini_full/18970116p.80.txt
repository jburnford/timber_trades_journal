ANNUAL CIRCULAR.

MESSRS. EDMISTON & MITCHELLS.
The past year has been an exceptionally
bright one for the timber trade in all its
branches. The shipbuilding on the Clyde
has been very brisk, and owing to the open
winter of 1895-96 housebuilding was carried
on almost without interruption during the
early spring, and a large number of new
contracts were started during the summer
and autumn months. Both of these in-
dustries, on which the timber trade is
largely dependent, are at present in a very
healthy condition, and we anticipate a good
trade for next year. Prices of nearly all
classes of timber and deals have remained
steady, and latterly have improved con-
siderably, and the year closes with stocks
well held, and prospects of a further
advance in values. The imports of yellow
pine, red pine, elm, ash, and birch have
all exceeded that of 1895, but as the
consumption has been good, the stocks of
these are light, except waney pine and ash.
The import of oak is 500 logs less than in
1895, and the stock is very light, and really
first-class timber is scarce. The trade in
cut timber continues on a large scale, and
although this year's import exceeded last
year's by about 520,000 pieces, the total
stock of deals and planks of all kinds is
only 1,400 standards more than at this time
last year, and is more than accounted for by
the increase in pine planks, Lower Port
pine deals, and fourth quality Quebec
pine, which together amount to 2,000
standards over last year. First, second,
and third quality pine are in good demand,
and top prices are being realised for them.
The year 1896 has been a record one in the

shipbuilding industry on the Clyde, the
amount of tonnage launched aggregating
fully 420,000 tons, which tops all past years,
and exceeds 1895 by 60,000 tons. The
dispute with the engineers, which retarded
work at the end of 1895, was happily settled
at the beginning of this year, and the trade
has steadily improved since then. The
majority of our yards are now well employed,
and will be for some months to come. The
total work on hand at this date amounts to
about 310,000 tons, as against 260,000 tons
a year ago. The total value of this year's
output is about £9,000,000, as against
£8,230,000 in 1895.

FIRE AT PORT GLASGOW.
One of the most destructive fires that has
occurred at Port Glasgow for many years
broke out on Wednesday morning in the
shipbuilding yard of Messrs. William Hamil-
ton & Co. The buildings where the
fire originated consisted of two long one-
storey buildings, each about 350 feet long,
and comprised the joiner shop, the polishing
shop, a store, and a sawmill, where the firm
did their own saw-milling.
Strenuous efforts were made to prevent
the spread of the flames to the adjoining
saw-mill. This, however, was to little pur-
pose. The walls of the joiner shop, which
were of wood, were all ablaze, and soon the
roof fell in with a crash, and this building
and all its contents were a mass of burning
ruins.
About two o'clock, when the fire was
raging at its fiercest, it was feared that it
might spread to the large block of buildings
forming the offices, moulding lofts, and
model-makers' rooms. Five horses, which
were in the stables about 30 yards away,
became restive, and were during the night
removed to a place of safety.
Huge piles of deck planking were stacked
alongside, and these had commenced to
steam with the heat. A pile of planking
near to the entrance to the sawmills also
caught fire, and the crane used at the saw-
mill for loading and unloading timber was
also destroyed.
The buildings have been entirely burnt to
the ground, and their valuable contents have
been utterly consumed, while the machinery
is and shafting have been bent and twisted to
destruction. No accurate amount of damage
can meantime be ascertained, but it is
estimated from £30,000 to £35,000, and is
covered by insurance.
Much delay is bound to be caused in
getting the fittings for the ships remade.

DOCK BILLS.
Among the Bills lodged for consideration
in the ensuing Session of Parliament, the
Borrowstounness Town and Harbour Bill will,
amongst other things, empower the borough
commissioners to transfer their rights and
interests in the harbour and docks of
Borrowstounness to the Caledonian Rail-
way Company, and confer powers on that
company in relation to the harbour and
docks.
The Clyde Navigation Bill will extend the
periods limited by the Clyde Navigation Act
of 1894 for the compulsory purchase of
lands and for the completion of the railway
authorised by the Clyde Navigation Act,
1891.
The Kilpatrick Dock Bill is promoted by
Alexander Wylie, John Macausland Denny,
John Hay, W. F. Russell, James Donald,
John Neilson, William Beardmore, and
George Burrell for the incorporation of a
company with a capital of £150,000 and
£50,000 borrowing powers to construct a
tidal dock on the north side of the river
Clyde, near the light tower known as
Donald's Quay Light, together with certain
short lines of railway.
The Stromness Harbour Bill is for the
incorporation of commissioners to improve
some Harbour and the construction of new
quays near the Commissioners' Quay and
the Warehouse Pier and Murray's Pier, and
for the construction of slipways, embank-
ments, &c. Power is taken to borrow
£30,000.

THE T[?]
JANUARY 16, 1897.
BUILDING IN 1896.

EDINBURGH.
Not for many years has more activity been
manifested in the several branches of the
building trade than during the past year.
One of the largest of the undertakings at
present on hand, the rebuilding of the
Waverley Station and the erection of the
North British Railway Hotel, has not yet
reached the stage when the mason and the
joiner with their coadjutors come fully into
play; but when the ground has been pro-
perly cleared for them the trade will un-
doubtedly witness a "boom." This, at any
rate, is the opinion of those who know how
matters are the new schemes which in the
next year or two will be launched, the North
British reconstructions, formidable as they
are, being only among several which, should
they be proceeded with simultaneously, will
tax the resources of builders to the utmost.
Thus the Caledonian Railway Company,
as the Herald understands, are seriously
contemplating the erection of a hotel above
the fine station they recently completed. Then
the Corporation are preparing for the con-
struction of a new fever hospital at a mini-
mum outlay of £250,000, while the cabling
of the streets will necessitate a series of new
subway stations at various points in the
city. Another big undertaking will be
the building of the Usher Hall, when the
Town Council have finally decided where
Mr. Usher's gift shall be placed, and there
is besides the re-erection of the Council
Chambers, or at least such a structural
re-arrangement as will be almost tantamount
to a re-erection. The year has seen a
further extension of the housing capacity of
the city, especially in the Morningside,
Merchiston, and Murrayfield districts.
Altogether the year has not only been an
exceedingly prosperous one for the most
influential trade in Edinburgh, but the
prospects for the coming year are of the
brightest. There have been no wage dis-
putes during 1896. The joiners were on
strike for a fortnight pending the re-arrange-
ment of their working rules. The matter
was compromised by concessions on both
sides, and the men have been working away
by the piece at the rate of 9½d. per hour, a
conjunction of time and piece work which
has been found to work well. The granting
of the Saturday half-holiday at the rate of
9½d. per hour for fifty-one hours a week has
exceeded the most sanguine expectations of
receiving a fair day's wage for a fair day's
work. The masons are paid at the rate of 9d.
per hour for fifty-one hours a week. The
burgh engineer's department and the Dean of
Guild Court are preparing for a busy year.
The Heriot-Watt College, the Free Church
Lodge, the Royal Scottish Museum, and the
Scotia Skating Palace are among the larger
buildings which have been completed. The
1,200 houses which it was estimated would
be required to meet the wants of the city
startling as the figures seemed, have been
fully realised, and there is every prospect of
a similar demand being made during 1897.
The large number of tenements which have
been erected have been almost entirely and
fully let before they were completed, and
the latest returns show that there are fewer
unlet houses in Edinburgh now than there were
on the same date last year.
