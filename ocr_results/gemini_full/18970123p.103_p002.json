The liabilities were £2,378 9s. 3d., and the assets £323 2s. 6d.\n\nBATH & WELLS (William J. Bath and Job M.

E., builder, Earl’s Court, Sefton Park, Bristol, builder. Mr. E. G. Clarke appeared for the debtor, and applied for his discharge at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Harley. The Official Receiver (Mr. E. J. Richards) stated that the failure occurred in February, 1895. The liabilities disclosed by the statement were £558, but the proofs actually admitted were £294, and the probable claims were returned at £300, making a total of £594. The assets were estimated to produce £215, but had realised nothing. Mr. Spofforth stated that the debtor had been unfortunate in building transactions, in the fact that a gentleman who had been advancing him money suddenly ceased to do so, for a week, in order that the Official Receiver might have an opportunity of considering an offer that the debtor should consent to judgment for £100, payable in instalments at three, six, and nine months.\n\nBLEEZE, GEORGE, builder, Erith.—This bankrupt, now residing at Mill Road, Erith, made an application for his discharge at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court, before his Honour Judge Snagge, on Thursday week. His Honour said he did not think it desirable to allow the debtor another opportunity of going into trade immediately, but the debtor could apply again, if he chose to do so, in four years time.\n\nBUTLER BROS., builders and contractors, Wolverhampton.—At a meeting of creditors it was resolved that debtors execute a deed of assignment to Mr. Joseph H. Scott, general manager of the Timber Trades Association, as trustee, with a committee consisting of the principal creditors. The liabilities are about £1,950, and the assets £1,200.—Under this the fully-secured creditors registered deed the following are creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nFurniss & Co., London .. .. .. 74 0 0\nHutchinson, W., Bilston .. .. .. 44 0 0\nCarr & Co., Great Grimsby .. .. .. 175 0 0\nSanderson Bros, Hull .. .. .. 50 0 0\nBotwood, J., Wolverhampton .. .. 62 0 0\nButler, P.

Subscribed Capital, £255,000.\nthe Wandsworth district, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S E., under the presidency of the senior Official Receiver, Mr. Mackintosh. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £860, and assets estimated to produce £643, after deducting the claims of preferential creditors payable in full. There was a large attendance of creditors, and the Official Receiver said the following creditors were entitled to vote :— Raffety, Thornton, & Co., £43; F. Stanley, £18; Charles H. Paddock, £16; and F. W. Marter, £12. The following proofs had been received too late for voting purposes :— William Bloore, £35; S. Darling, £300; J. Harris, £19; W. Smith, £10; and Sayer & Co., £10. Mr. Street, of Messrs. Ward, Perks, & Mackay, said he had been through the book debts, and he did not think they would realize £113. The Official Receiver asked if the debtor could get the 20s. in the pound, guaranteed by some of his friends, if the meeting were adjourned; if so, he did not think the creditors would have any objection to a short adjournment. After a long discussion, it was resolved to adjudicate the debtor bankrupt, and Mr. J. Davis, accountant, of Coleman Street, E.C., was appointed trustee, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection. It was further resolved that the committee of inspection be elected at a future meeting, to be called for that purpose, and in the meantime the Official Receiver to act as a committee of inspection.\n\nEDWARDS BROTHERS, builders, Bellagio, East Grinstead.—The above-named debtors came up for their public examination at the Tunbridge Wells Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Stone. Joseph Edwards said he began a joint business with his brother in April, 1892, and managed the business. The books of the firm were jointly kept by himself and Mr. Nightingale, who acted as an assistant in the business. For three years there had been no profits on the business. Profits were made on some of the contracts at first, but not subsequently. They had bad and doubtful debts of £144 17s. 6d. Robert John Edwards, another member of the firm, said he could confirm his brother's evidence. Eventually the examination was ordered to be closed.\n\nEZARD, GEORGE, & JOHN HODKINSON, builders, 150, Ashton New Road, Bradford.—The adjourned examination of these debtors took place at the Manchester Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Atkinson. In answer to questions put by Mr. Crew, the debtor, Ezard, stated that prior to filing his petition he had paid to Mrs. Stirk, his sister-in-law, the sum of £30, which was owing to her, and he had also deposited with her a sum of £29 10s., which he had got back from her as recently as Friday or Saturday last. Eventually the examination was ordered to be again adjourned.\n\nGRANT, JAMES, Healey, joiner, &c., Princess Stroet, Cowley Road, Oxford.—The above-named debtor made an application for his discharge at the Oxford Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday week, before his Honour Judge Snagge. It appeared that the petition was filed in 1888. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £370, and the proofs actually admitted amounted to £317. The assets were estimated to produce £155 8s. 3d. A first and final dividend amounting to 6s. 8d. in the pound had been paid. After Mr. Phillips had addressed the Court on debtor’s behalf, his Honour said he would grant the discharge conditionally upon\n\nJANUARY 23, 1897.\nthe debtor's consenting to judgment being entered against him for another 3s. 4d. in the pound. It was not a bad case, there being nothing to impugn the bankrupt's discretion.\n\nGOFF, ALFRED H., builder and contractor, High Street, Alcester.—Under this registered deed the following are creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nHawkes, O.

Tom Hatherly and Henry Carr), trading as Hatherly & Carr, at 39, Old City Road, Bristol, builders and contractors.—Mr. Walter Watts appeared for the trustee at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, and stated that an adjournment would be necessary, as the accounts filed were very voluminous, containing at least 10,000 items, and would require careful examination. The debtor furnished an account which he had had time to go into properly, but from a casual examination of it he ventured to say that it was a most unsatisfactory account. He agreed with the trustee, Mr. J. H. Scott, in saying so. In fact, it was not a bad case, there being an account, but a bare statement which was highly unsatisfactory, more especially with regard to an alleged loss of £4,000 which he had sustained on what was called the Gothenburg contract. That was a large item, and was so unsatisfactory that he (the Official Receiver) would ask the Registrar to make a further order on the debtor to furnish a proper deficiency account, and render it to him within seven days, and adjourned examination to the 2nd of March.\n\nHAYNES, JOHN, builder, 11, Lord Street, Manchester.—This debtor came up for his public examination at the Manchester Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Atkinson. The statement of affairs showed liabilities expected to rank amounting to £2,493 16s. 6d., and a deficiency of £1,930 16s. 7d. In answer to the Official Receiver, the debtor explained, in answer to the Official Receiver, that he was apart from debts arising out of a partnership into which he entered in 1892 with Mr. J. W. Fitton and Mr. Charles Tomkins. They began business as “speculative builders,” and Mr. Tomkins afterwards withdrew. The bulk of his separate liability had been incurred in building speculations outside the partnership with Mr. Fitton. His private debts would be probably £700, or £800. He alleged as the causes of failure “bad building speculations which have turned out adversely from want of practical experience of the building trade, and law costs.” Eventually the examination was ordered to be adjourned.\n\nWELLS, CHARLES, coal and timber merchant, Commercial Buildings, Prince’s Dock Side, Hull.—This case came up for further examination at the Hull Bankruptcy Court on Monday.—The Official Receiver (Mr. A. Stewart Maples) said that at the last hearing an order was made for the debtor to furnish certain accounts. On Saturday the debtor furnished an account, but from a casual examination of it he ventured to say that it was a most unsatisfactory account. He agreed with the trustee, Mr. J. H. Scott, in saying so. In fact, it was not a bad case, there being an account, but a bare statement which was highly unsatisfactory, more especially with regard to an alleged loss of £4,000 which he had sustained on what was called the Gothenburg contract. That was a large item, and was so unsatisfactory that he (the Official Receiver)\n\nAUSTRIAN WAINSCOT OAK.\nJ. H. ROWNTREE, 30, Great St. Helens, LONDON, E.C.\nTELEGRAMS—\"GRACENOTE, LONDON.\"",
