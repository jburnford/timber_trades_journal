George Gordon & Co., timber merchants, of Aberdeen, have now added to their fine plant at their works in Blaikie's Quay, a horizontal board-sawing machine, which is said to be the only machine of the kind in Scotland. The feature of the machine is that it has two horizontal parallel saws. The effect of having two saws is, of course, that the machine cuts a log into boards in half the time that a single-saw machine can. The log or tree to be divided into boards is placed by means of a crane on a massive iron table, 30 ft. long and about five tons in weight. It is fixed firmly to the table by means of dogs, and the table is then run up along rails to the sawing machine by means of a revolving screw working on a rack. The end of the log is thus fed against the saws, one of which projects a little in front of the other. The saws are, as regards height one above the other, placed a distance apart equal to the thickness of the boards which are desired to be cut. The saw-frames in which the saws are fixed are driven from side to side by connecting-rods off a two-throw crank with opposite centres, so that the motion of the one balances that of the other, and prevents vibration. The crank makes 200 revolutions a minute, each saw, therefore, making double that number of journeys across the machine in a minute. The machine can saw boards up to 48 in. in width, and its cut is found to be very clean. The makers were Messrs. Robinson & Son, Limited, of Rochdale.\nBUILDING NEWS.\nDuring 1896, 409 new houses and shops were built in Aberdeen, an increase of 154 on the figures for the previous years, which addition to the valuation of the city was £14,822, an advance of £5,032 on the year 1895. At the same time, the absorption of empty houses is going on at a greatly increased ratio, the total rental of urban property being returned to the Corporation as £4,948 at the end of 1895, and £10,132 at the close of 1896.\nThe Aberdeen Town Council have decided to erect a fireproof Corporation lodging-house at a cost of £10,293. It has been remitted to a special committee to consider and report as to the advisability of widening Union Bridge, the best mode of doing so, and the probable cost.\nAn order for about £4,000 worth of granite has been placed with Mr. James M'Intosh, Lorne Granite Works, Aberdeen, by the Corporation of Leeds. The granite, which will consist chiefly of some 400 turned\nBUCHANAN & FRENCH,\nTimber Importers, Merchants and Saw-millers,\nAlbert Saw-mills, RENFREW,\nAnd 52, St. Enoch Square, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address: \"WAINSCOT.\"\nTelephone: 5161, GLASGOW. 8, RENFREW.\nA. & W.
