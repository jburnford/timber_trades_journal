Mr. Spofforth, who appeared for the debtor, said the application had been adjourned from the last court to give the Official Receiver an opportunity of considering whether he would accept an offer made on the debtor's behalf. The Official Receiver said he had no objection to the discharge being granted on the terms offered. His Honour said the debtor's discharge would be granted upon the debtor consenting to judgment being entered against him for £115 8s. Mr. Spofforth said the money would be paid forthwith.\nDIAMOND & PORTER (Thomas Diamond and Frederick Porter, late trading as above), builders, Bathurst Mews, Westbourne Street, Hyde Park.-Under this registered deed, the following are creditors:-\nMcDowall, Stevens, & Co., Limited, London £ s. d. 32 0 0\nColthurst & Harding, London .. .. .. 113 0 0\nPerry & Putland, London .. .. .. 110 0 0\nNicholson, James, & Co., London .. .. 13 0 0\nJames, W., & Co., London .. .. .. 29 0 0\nPearson, R.

The liabilities were returned at £989 18s. 6d.; proofs for £774 3s. 7d. have been lodged, and nothing has been realised. It appeared that the bankrupt in 1884 commenced speculative building with about £700 capital, and carried on the same, first at Forest Gate, and subsequently at Kingston, Whitstable, and Croydon, with indifferent success, down to the date of the receiving order. The Official Receiver reported as offences, the absence of assets, and that the bankrupt had not kept proper books of account. His Honour suspended the discharge for two years.\nHELLIWELL, JOSEPH, contractor, 10, Wells Street, Keighley.-The public examination of this debtor took place at the Bradford\n\nNo. 5.

WELLS & CO.,\n97, Midland Rd., St. Pancras, LONDON. Branch: Carnarvon St., MANCHESTER.\nBankruptcy Court on Thursday week, before Mr. Registrar Lee. The Official Receiver said that during the last twenty years the debtor had been successively a journeyman mason, a contractor, and an inventor. He had taken out patents in connection with spinning frames, neckties, beer taps, mantel pieces, wasting machinery, and carving appliances, which had into other hands for either lapsed or passed considerations which, in the main, had turned out valueless. Eventually the examination was ordered to be closed.\nMAHOE, JAMES, builder, Parliament Street, S.W., and Bucklersbury, E.C.-The bankrupt attended for his public examination on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Brougham. Accounts were now filed showing unsecured debts £3,061, and debts fully secured, £16,055; against assets, £2,925, of which £2,850 was the surplus estimated to arise from the mortgaged property. The following are scheduled with the creditors:-\nCooper, John, Lower Addiscombe Road, Croydon .. .. .. .. £ s. d. 30 5 9\nGorrill, R., joiner, Newington Butts, S.E. .. 120 7 6\nMessrs (Limited), Gracechurch Street, E.C. 118 9 7\nMoss, Wm., Leadenhall Street .. .. 94 0 0\nRopkins & Co., Wisbech .. .. .. 63 3 1\nRanson, -, Westbourne Park, W. .. .. 61 12 0\nStenning, J., & Son, Bletchley .. .. 45 3 0\nTappin, H., timber merchant, Ilford .. .. 180 0 0\nThe debtor states that he was a sub-contractor for joiners' and carpenters' work, and prior to February, 1892, started as a speculative builder (with £250 capital), his offices since August, 1895, having been at 19, Parliament Street, and 20, Bucklersbury. He attributed his failure to loss on ancient lights and costs of two actions in respect of a party wall, and to interest on borrowed money. Further accounts being required, the examination was adjourned.\nPARRY, E. D., builder, Rhondda Valley and Taff Well.-The public examination of this debtor took place at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court on Friday last, before Mr. Registrar Cousins. Replying to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor said that when he went to Taff Well he was about £1,000 to the bad, but he managed to reduce that indebtedness considerably, and he thought he should have been able to pull through had it not been for the stoppage of a colliery near Caerphilly. The debtor was eventually allowed to pass his examination.\nRIELLY BROTHERS (Walter & James Rielly, trading as), builders, Newington Green Road, Islington, and Allandale Road, New Southgate.-A private meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday, at the offices of Messrs. (S. Laycock & Co., Limited) in the chair, when it was decided that Mr. J. H. Scott, of the Timber Trades Association, and Mr. E. Williams be the trustees under a deed of assignment to be executed by the debtors, with six of the principal creditors as a committee of inspection. The liabilities were estimated at £3,243 in the statement of affairs, the stock-in-trade at £1,200, the machinery at £935, and other assets making a total of £2,244.\nRODGERS, SAMUEL, stonemason, contractor, and builder, 16, Cheapside, Worksop.-Under this registered deed the following are creditors:-\nLavarack & Goddard, Limited, Hull .. .. £ s. d. 102 0 0\nSingleton, W., Mansfield .. .. .. 78 0 0\nSaunders, E.
