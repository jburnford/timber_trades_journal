The stock of sawn pitch pine is much less than at this time last year (about one-third less), and with moderation in supplies the improved values experienced for some time past will no doubt continue; the increasing extent and variety of use to which this wood is put ensure for it a steady demand and high rate of consumption. Prices of teak remain firm, the shipbuilding demand being on a large scale; recent imports are mostly been on contract, going direct into consumers' hands.\nFor pine and spruce deals, Quebec and Lower port, the demand continues active and prices satisfactory. Stocks when last taken up were favourable for holders, being less on the whole than the preceding year.\n\nRobert Hamilton & Co.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n75, ST.

Mention was made last week of a consignment of 50 logs round mahogany, landed at Cessnock, for Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells. It has since been disposed of, and delivered to purchasers.\nAnother lot is shortly expected by same broker per liner from Boston. A cargo of Belize Honduras mahogany, it is reported, has been ordered to this port, which will be good news to buyers, as Belize mahogany has been scarce in this market for a long time past. The brokers are Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.\n\nLEITH.\nThe importation of wood goods at present is on a very reduced scale, the only arrivals reported this week being 2,367 oak staves, 1,810 pieces oak and poplar lumber, and 47 logs poplar per \"Bellona\" (s) from Newport News and Norfolk, Va. Wintry weather has prevailed during the last seven days, and almost entirely stopped out-door work, so that there is a decided slackness in the deliveries of wood from the docks and yards this week, otherwise there is no change to\n\nJAMES KENNEDY & CO.,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchants,\n69, BUCHANAN STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"LIGNUM, GLASGOW.\"\n\nLOVE & STEWART,\nPitwood Importers & Coal Exporters,\n140, HOPE STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"LOVART.\" Telephone No. 3081.\n\nLOVE & FIFE,\nENGINEERS,\nWOOD-WORKING MACHINERY\nOf every Description.\nLEITH.\n\nRENNIE, BRYSON, & Co.,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchants,\n128, HOPE STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegrams, \"SPRUCE.\" Telephone No. 4,434\n\nJOHN CAMPBELL,\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\nINVERNESS.\nAlways on hand a Large and Varied Stock of MINING and COLLIERY TIMBER in Larch and Scots Fir.
