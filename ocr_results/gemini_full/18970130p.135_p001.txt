TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
The hard weather during the past week has interfered with the progress of housebuilding work, and is a temporary check to orders; but the outlook is cheerful, there being a large amount of building work on hand which, under milder weather conditions, will go forward all the brisker for being retarded a little meantime.
There is a good general inquiry, and transactions to a satisfactory amount have taken place, and stocks in first hands are being rapidly diminished.
Prices are firm, and from present indications are likely to be fully maintained. The stock of sawn pitch pine is much less than at this time last year (about one-third less), and with moderation in supplies the improved values experienced for some time past will no doubt continue; the increasing extent and variety of use to which this wood is put ensure for it a steady demand and high rate of consumption. Prices of teak remain firm, the shipbuilding demand being on a large scale; recent imports are mostly been on contract, going direct into consumers' hands.
For pine and spruce deals, Quebec and Lower port, the demand continues active and prices satisfactory. Stocks when last taken up were favourable for holders, being less on the whole than the preceding year.

Timber Merchant,
TAYBRIDGE SAW-MILLS,
DUNDEE.
Always in stock all kinds of Home-grown Timber in the tree or Plank.

Quebec pine deals, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd qualities, have been specially firm in price.
There have been no auction sales held here by brokers during the past week, and none at present announced.
The imports to note at Glasgow for the week include consignments of teak logs and planks, &c., to the amount of about 800 loads, per "Prome" (s), discharged at Cessnock Dock, and particulars of which are given in the list of imports. Mention was made last week of a consignment of 50 logs round mahogany, landed at Cessnock, for Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells. It has since been disposed of, and delivered to purchasers.
Another lot is shortly expected by same broker per liner from Boston. A cargo of Belize Honduras mahogany, it is reported, has been ordered to this port, which will be good news to buyers, as Belize mahogany has been scarce in this market for a long time past. The brokers are Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.

LEITH.
The importation of wood goods at present is on a very reduced scale, the only arrivals reported this week being 2,367 oak staves, 1,810 pieces oak and poplar lumber, and 47 logs poplar per "Bellona" (s) from Newport News and Norfolk, Va. Wintry weather has prevailed during the last seven days, and almost entirely stopped out-door work, so that there is a decided slackness in the deliveries of wood from the docks and yards this week, otherwise there is no change to
