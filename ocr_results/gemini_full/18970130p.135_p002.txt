BUILDING NEWS.
The Fraserburgh Commissioners have resolved on the second scheme recently prepared by the surveyor (Mr. Alexander) as a first instalment of the new water-supply scheme for Kirkmyres—viz., the laying of a new 10 in. main from Hillhead reservoir to the town.

The proposed expenditure of Ayr Town Council for 1897 embraces £10,000 on sewerage, £6,000 on iron bridge near station, £3,000 on extension of the waterworks, £1,000 on underground conveniences, and £10,000 on extension of electric-lighting plant.

Plans of a new Board School to be erected in Carbrook Street, Paisley, at a cost of £8,000, have been passed by the Dean of Guild Court.

The Aberdeen Town Council have decided to relay the carriage-way in Spa Road with tar macadam at a cost of £280. A deputation has been appointed in connection with the proposal to erect a public slaughter-house in the city, to proceed to other towns for the purpose of inspecting the most recent and approved description of slaughter-houses, and collecting information on the subject.

A GERMAN VIEW OF SCOTTISH FORESTRY.
Under the title of "A Forest Student's Tour in Scotland," Dr. Schwappach records his impressions of forestry in Scotland in an article contributed to the December issue of the official organ of the Forest Academy at Eberswalde. After briefly tracing the course taken by the excursion of the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society in August last, the doctor goes pretty fully into the special tour arranged for him by and under the guidance of Professors Bayley-Balfour and Somerville, which enabled him to see the best wooded portions of Scotland. After a few preliminary remarks he proceeds to effect, Dr. Schwappach proceeds:— "The most interesting observations I made were those in connection with the condition of our timber trees. On all the estates I visited I found numerous specimens of almost without exception in vigorous growth, and beautiful examples of their kind. While the North American deciduous trees occur, yet American conifers are most represented in landscape work, and, to a less extent, the Japanese. As a forest tree the Douglas fir is most common, after that Cupressus Lawsoniana, Thuja gigantea, Tsuga Mertensiana, Picea sitchensis, Abies nobilis, &c., all of which are represented in German forests. Specially to be mentioned is the large collection in the Pinetum at Scone. With a few exceptions all the trees here stand either singly or in variously shaped groups, but always in such a way that each individual has room for the development of its branches and characteristic habit. Owing to this, it is impossible to form an opinion regarding the development of stem form or the behaviour of the trees in close plantations; only the height-growth can be regarded as a criterion of their rate of growth. In spite of their situation and the influence of strong winds, the older individuals are, with a few exceptions, now 60-65 years of age, and have a height of 60-65 ft. The largest plantations of Douglas
