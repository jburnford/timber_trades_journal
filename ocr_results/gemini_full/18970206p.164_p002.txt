AMSON, JOHN, builder, Crewe.—In the list of creditors published last week the debtor owed to Messrs. Thorburn & Co., of Liverpool, should have been given as £62 15s. 5d., not £145.

BLAKEMORE, SAMUEL, builder, Prescot Street, New Brighton.—The public examination of this debtor took place at the Birkenhead Bankruptcy Court, on the 21st ult., before Mr. Registrar Cave. The statement of affairs showed liabilities to unsecured creditors amounting to £2,691 5s., and assets estimated to produce £2,141, leaving a deficiency of £550 5s. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor said that he was 78 years of age, and for about 54 years previous to June, 1894, he had been employed as a working joiner by the Bridgwater Trustees at 35s. a week. In 1894 he was pensioned off at 3s. 6d. a week. After that he worked for a year with Mr. Christian. He left Mr. Christian in June, 1895, to commence building on his own account in Prescot Street, New Brighton, when he had a capital of £30. Eventually the examination was ordered to be adjourned, leave being given to debtor to amend his statement of affairs by inserting particulars of certain mortgages.

HICKS, HENRY, builder, 15, Tyndal Road, Leyton. At a sitting for public examination held in this case last week, before Mr. Registrar Hope, the bankrupt was allowed to pass, his accounts showing gross liabilities £1,275 11s. 3d. and assets £411 6s. 10d. He stated that he commenced as a jobbing builder in 1893 without any capital, and in January 1896, having amassed £300, he embarked in speculative building operations at Tyndal Road, Leyton. In July last an execution was levied by certain trade creditors, whereupon the freeholder took possession of the property, and employed witness as foreman to complete the houses. He ascribed his insolvency to want of sufficient capital for the speculative operations, and to the action of the pressing creditors and the freeholder.

HUMPHREY J. P., builder and contractor, Manor Park Road, Harlesden, N.W. For a sitting for public examination was held in this case last week, before Mr. Registrar Hope. Accounts were furnished showing liabilities £3,277 12s. 8d., of which £2,016 7s. 11d. were unsecured, and assets £1,624 18s. 6d. The creditors included the following:—

Elliott & Co., Newbury .. .. .. .. 4 4 4
Farquharson, Bros. & Co., Gracechurch St. 15 15 6
Jones, Samuel, Harlesden, N.W. .. .. 148 19 5

Watts, Edward, timber merchant, Harlesden, N.W. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 16 6 0
The debtor was formerly a builder's foreman, and in June, 1894 (having then about £120 capital), commenced business as a builder and contractor at 4, Crownhill Road, Harlesden, removing in January, 1895, to 38, Manor Park Road, Harlesden, where down to the date of the receiving order he continued to trade. He attributed his failure to want of capital, losses on contracts through under-estimating, to illness, and generally to his expenses having been in excess of his profits. Mr. H. Brougham appeared as Official Receiver and Mr. Street, on behalf of the trustee. The examination was concluded.

MAXWELL, WM., joiner and cabinet maker, Blyth.—On Tuesday at the Newcastle Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Ingle-dew, this debtor was examined. He stated that he had carried on business at Blyth for 40 years. During the last 13 years he had been engaged in building houses. He had always managed to pay his debts. All the property mentioned in his statement of affairs, and mortgaged to fully secured creditors, was built by himself. The Official Receiver suggested that he had built these houses too well, and that they were, so to speak, too substantial for such a class of house property. Debtor said his difficulty was in connection with the plastering, which he could not get done without great delay, although he paid 11d. an hour for the work. The property was consequently too long on his hands before it was let. He had always managed to pay his way until now, and he had always done a hard day's work. The Official Receiver pointed out that debtor's debts amounted to £190, and his assets to £90, and stated that after 40 years' trading it was not much to have a debit balance of £90. The examination was adjourned to Thursday next.

McLAUGHLIN, J. A., builder and decorator, 60, Camplin Street, New Cross, S.E.—This bankrupt attended for his public examination on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Brougham, his account showing unsecured debts £439 4s. and assets £9 10s. 6d. It appeared that the bankrupt commenced business in 1886 with under £50 capital, and in 1892 he took a workshop at the Mews, Bessont Street, New Cross Road, and a yard at 74, Nutcroft Road, Peckham, but in November, 1895, in consequence of loss on trading, bad debts and pressure by creditors, he abandoned business. Since then he has had no regular occupation. The examination was closed.

PHILLIPS, H., builder, Exeter and Taunton.—His Honour Judge Edge, gave his decision at the Exeter Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week on the motion made by the trustee in this bankruptcy for setting aside orders the bankrupt had given to the Great Western Railway Company and the Somerset County Council for the payment to Thomas & Co., brickmakers, Wellington, of £300 each on the bankrupt's behalf. The orders were given by the bankrupt that his supply of bricks might be continued, as he had railway and County Council contracts in hand. Mr. Harris appeared for the trustee, and Mr. Mitchell for Messrs. Thomas. His Honour decided that Messrs. Thomas must pay forthwith to the trustees any sum received by them under the order in question, and must also pay the costs of the motion. Action suspended for 21 days to give an opportunity of appeal.
