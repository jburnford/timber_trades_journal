Bullock (Official Receiver) presiding. The debtor's statement showed gross liabilities of £1,743 3s. 3d., the amount expected to rank for dividend being £984 8s. 5d. The assets were estimated to produce £473 9s. 5d., and the deficiency was put down at £510 19s. 2d. The debtor attributed his failure to losses on contracts, heavy expenses, and loss of work through illness. The Official Receiver reported that the receiving order was made on the debtor's petition, and he had been adjudged bankrupt. He commenced business without capital about thirteen years ago. The unsecured liabilities were in respect of work done and goods supplied during the last twelve months. The fully-secured creditors were the debtor's bankers, the security held being a mortgage of properties in Hassell's Street, Wharf Street, and Gilbert Street, Newcastle. The debtor had not kept a cash-book or bought ledger. The meeting appointed Mr. C. E. Bullock, of Hanley, trustee of the estate, with a committee of inspection. The Official Receiver was authorised to continue a payment of £2 per week to the debtor for a month longer.\n\nWM.
