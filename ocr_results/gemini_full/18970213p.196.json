On Tuesday, 9th inst., Mr. D. W. Beattie held a public sale at the Edinburgh Docks. There was a good average attendance, and for the Baltic deals and battens a fairly active demand was experienced, especially for unsorted 6½x2½ white battens, for which good prices were made, ranging from 1d. for best Riga to 1¼d. per lineal foot for St. Petersburg.\n\nBUCHANAN & FRENCH,\nTimber Importers, Merchants and Saw-millers,\nAlbert Saw mills, RENFREW.\nAnd 52, St. Enoch Square, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address: \"WAINSCOT.\"\nTelephone 5161, GLASGOW. & RENFREW.\n\nTIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nFEBRUARY 13, 1897.\nFor redwood there was not so much inquiry, and the quantity of such disposed of was correspondingly restricted.\nPrices all round showed an improvement, although, as already indicated, this was most marked in the case of white battens. Some American walnut, cherry, oak, and canary boards were offered, but the quality of the latter especially not being choice, no satisfactory bid was obtainable, and the goods had to be withdrawn.\n\nIMPORTS.\nARDROSSAN.\nFeb. 6 Klampenborg-Reval-1,895 lds. sleeper blocks, 125 lds. sleepers-W.
