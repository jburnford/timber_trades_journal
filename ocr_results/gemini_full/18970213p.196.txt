LEITH.
There has been an entire absence of arrivals of wood goods during the past week, and with improved weather there are larger deliveries from the yarded stocks. On Tuesday, 9th inst., Mr. D. W. Beattie held a public sale at the Edinburgh Docks. There was a good average attendance, and for the Baltic deals and battens a fairly active demand was experienced, especially for unsorted 6½x2½ white battens, for which good prices were made, ranging from 1d. for best Riga to 1¼d. per lineal foot for St. Petersburg.

TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
FEBRUARY 13, 1897.
For redwood there was not so much inquiry, and the quantity of such disposed of was correspondingly restricted.
Prices all round showed an improvement, although, as already indicated, this was most marked in the case of white battens. Some American walnut, cherry, oak, and canary boards were offered, but the quality of the latter especially not being choice, no satisfactory bid was obtainable, and the goods had to be withdrawn.
