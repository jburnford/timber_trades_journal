Ross & Co. wrote from Melbourne on December 16th :-Since our last issue the demand for the various lines under review has somewhat declined, and it is improbable that we shall experience any improvement in this direction until after the Christmas holidays. Values have been fairly well maintained, but at this period, have shown no stocking-taking at the disposition to increase. The probability that the future laying down cost of several lines has been considerably advanced. No business of importance has been reported in spruce. Fairly assorted lines are somewhat harder to [?], on account of the shortage of imports, as arranged for. The imports of kauri have been 1,144,000 ft. super. The arrivals have been the \" Handa Isle,\" \" Elizabeth Graham,\" \" Lady Mabel \" and \" Royal Tar.\" The whole of this quantity has been placed ex for wharf delivery. The demand continues fairly brisk.\nA number of capitalists in England are forming a Tasmanian Timber and Produce Company, chiefly with the idea of pushing the sale of Tasmanian timber, and they are asking the Agent General of this colony to act as trustee for the debenture-holders of the company, says the Pastoralists' Review. They are also negotiating for the purchase of three saw-mills in Tasmania. In connection with the timber trade, the Agent General, writing to the Premier, says he will lose no opportunity of pushing it. He has interviewed a representative of a large firm of timber dealers, who is sanguine of the success of the trade.\nMacEWAN & CO.\nTIMBER MERCHANTS,\nLILYBANK SAW-MILLS,\nSt. Andrews Rd,\nGLASGOW.\nJAMES JONES\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\nLARBERT.\nEvery description of round and cut-up Home Timber supplied for Collieries, Cartwrights, Boatbuilders, Shipbuilders, &c.",
