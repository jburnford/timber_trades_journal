TRADE REPORTS
GLASGOW.
The arrivals continue light, being composed chiefly of sundry parcels of oak planks, staves, &c., from the United States, beside those mentioned in the list, there are further consignments just to hand, per "Orthis" (s), from Baltimore, to be discharged at Cessnock quay. A consignment of two steamers from Newport News and Baltimore are due this week. The various parcels recently landed have been well taken up, except for a cargo of pitch pine (round), per "Boston" steamer, which has been disposed of to the same buyers, and a further shipment (Messrs. Edmiston & Mitchells) is now being delivered from the quay. A consignment of 592 loads logs (sawn) and deals has for a week been a cargo of 592 loads teak, consigned to Messrs. Allison, Cousland, & Co.; and at Grangemouth there is a cargo of pitch pine comprising about 800 loads logs (sawn) and 320 loads deals and boards.
The steady demand which has for a considerable time past characterised trade still continues, and from the quantities of timber and deals going into buyers' hands it may be expected that the statistics for the current quarter will show a fair rate of consumption and a marked depletion of stock held by importers.

Always in stock all kinds of Home-grown Timber in the tree or Plank.

Although housebuilding has been going on extensively, properties are generally well occupied, which is an encouraging feature, but the outlook is rendered less bright by the high cost of building now owing to advances in men's wages. Masons, bricklayers, and joiners are at present being paid at the rate of 9d. per hour, with ½d. an hour extra for expenses of travelling, &c., when engaged in outlying districts. Plumbers have been in receipt of 8½d. an hour, and they are pressing for an increase of 1d. The joiners have sent in an application for ½d an hour advance.
But for the checks that may be interposed by labour troubles, the conditions of trade as affecting our leading wood-consuming industries (housebuilding, shipbuilding, &c.) are favourable, and point to the continuance of a high rate of consumption.

LEITH.
There are the following arrivals to report this week, viz. :—355 pcs. dogwood, 236 pine deals, 2,400 oak staves, and 435 boxes lumber, per s.s. "Croft" from New York. 6 pcs. oak per s.s. "Roma" from Copenhagen, also 45 bdls. poplar lumber, and 2,814 oak staves from Newport News, and 70 logs, 190 bdls and 572 pcs. poplar from Norfolk, all per s.s. "Cheniston."
There is a steady trade doing the sawmills being well employed, especially with finishings for the buildings now being completed, but there is less demand in the meantime for manufactured goods.

Messrs. Low, Kinghorn & Co., held a public sale at the Burgh Saw Mills, on Tuesday 23rd inst., at which there was a fair average attendance of buyers, and a satisfactory overture of goods. The catalogue was chiefly made up of cut timber and boards, for which good prices were got. Of deals and battens no large quantity was offered, but no difficulty was experienced in placing such goods, especially in whitewood.
