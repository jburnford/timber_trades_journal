It is to be called the\nAlexander Hospital. The plans, which have\nbeen passed, were prepared by Mr. A.\nM'Gregor Mitchell, architect and burgh\nengineer, Coatbridge, and show a set of buildings in the Old Scotch Baronial\nstyle of architecture. The cost will be about\n£8,500, and there will be 13 beds for patients\nmeeting with accidents in the districts of\nOld and New Monkland and Shotts.

Colonel Bennett said they had\nin Glasgow, to a certain extent, proved\nthe possibility of the existence of exchanges\nin this country. The general principle on\nwhich they had been founded was that the\nmore intimate social relation and acquaintance\nwith each other would tend to check bitter-\nness and rivalry, and keep the eagerness of\ncompetition within limits, and believing that\nthe skill and knowledge of each member\nwould in great measure be acquired by all,\nand their usefulness to the community in\nwhich they lived increased, formed them-\nselves into associations which had gradually\ngrown into what were now known as Build-\ning Exchanges. These institutions were\nfound to exist in every large city. After\nreferring specially to the Philadelphia\nBuilders' Exchange, which he took as a\nmodel, the lecturer remarked that the weak\npart of the architect's office in this country\nwas the want of professional journeymen\nto carry on their labour. Too much\nwas attempted to be done by the young\ngentleman assistant, who failed to realise the\nreal nature of the business till he started as\na full fledged architect for himself. Speak-\ning of the value of the Exchange to trade,\nColonel Bennett said the institution would\nbe worth at least £50 a year to everyone of\nBUCHANAN & FRENCH,\nTimber Importers, Merchants and Saw-millers,\nAlbert Saw mills, RENFREW,\nAnd 52, St. Enoch Square, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address: \"WAINSCOT,\" RENFREW.\nTelephone: 5151, GLASGOW. 8 RENFREW.\nD.W.

The public\nconfidence in the tradesmen and a better feeling would be\nestablished between architects, surveyors, and\ntradesmen all round. Mr. Cook, of the Glasgow Building Trades\nExchange, and Mr. John Laird, valuator,\nGlasgow, also spoke. The Chairman having\ncalled for an expression of opinion whether\nthe proposed Building Trades' Exchange\nshould be gone on with, Councillor Graham\nformally moved that such an association should\nbe established for the encouragement and\nprotection of the building trades and\nrelative interests within the city of Edinburgh\nand the county of Scotland. Such an insti-\ntution, he said, was most desirable, because at\npresent there were no means by which\nmerchants and travellers, builders could meet and\ntransact business, except by their being\ncalled on by the latter. Mr. Peter White\nseconded, and the motion was unanimously\nagreed to. The Chairman intimated that\nthe number of shares applied for was between\n700 and 800, which augured pretty well for a\nbeginning. Colonel Bennett was thanked for\nhis lecture, and a committee of twenty-five\nwas appointed to forward the formation of the\nExchange.
