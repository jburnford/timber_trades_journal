BUILDING NEWS.
It is suggested that a Convalescent Home
should be established at Leith in connection
with the hospital, to commemorate the
Diamond Jubilee.
The new school erected by the Wemyss
School Board at Coaltown of Wemyss has
been opened. The school is built to accom-
modate over 400 children. Mr. Alex. Todd
was the architect, Mr. Thomas Brown
builder, Mr. Robert Suttie joiner, Mr. D.
Johnston slater and plasterer, and Mr. William
Nicol plumber.
A new hospital is to be erected in Blair
Street, Coatbridge. It is to be called the
Alexander Hospital. The plans, which have
been passed, were prepared by Mr. A.
M'Gregor Mitchell, architect and burgh
engineer, Coatbridge, and show a set of buildings in the Old Scotch Baronial
style of architecture. The cost will be about
£8,500, and there will be 13 beds for patients
meeting with accidents in the districts of
Old and New Monkland and Shotts. The
buildings will cover 1 1/2 acre of ground near
Gartsherrie and Drumpellier Stations, N.B.R.,
and will include nurses', doctors', convales-
cent, &c., rooms.
SHIPBUILDING.
Messrs. Ramage & Ferguson, have had a
successful trial trip with the steel well-
decked steamer "Vestra," 1,000 tons gross.
This firm has built and engineered this vessel
for Messrs. J. T. Salvesen & Co., Grange-
mouth, and she will be employed in the
Baltic trade. Her deadweight carrying
capacity is about 1,300 tons. The cylinders
are 15 in., 24 in., and 39 in. diameter, and
the stroke is 30 in. The "Vestra" is to
receive the 100 A1 class.
The Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, Troon,
are about to build for the East Devonshire
Steamship Company, Limited, a steel well-
deck steamer of about 300 tons gross. She
is to carry about 375 tons deadweight, and
is to be classed 100 A1.
BUILDING TRADES' EXCHANGE FOR EDINBURGH.
A meeting, attended by close upon 200
of those interested in the formation of the
proposed Building Trades' Exchange for
Edinburgh and district, on somewhat similar
lines to the Glasgow one, has been held in
Dowell's Rooms, Edinburgh, when a lecture
was delivered by Colonel Bennett, of
Glasgow. Colonel Bennett said they had
in Glasgow, to a certain extent, proved
the possibility of the existence of exchanges
in this country. The general principle on
which they had been founded was that the
more intimate social relation and acquaintance
with each other would tend to check bitter-
ness and rivalry, and keep the eagerness of
competition within limits, and believing that
the skill and knowledge of each member
would in great measure be acquired by all,
and their usefulness to the community in
which they lived increased, formed them-
selves into associations which had gradually
grown into what were now known as Build-
ing Exchanges. These institutions were
found to exist in every large city. After
referring specially to the Philadelphia
Builders' Exchange, which he took as a
model, the lecturer remarked that the weak
part of the architect's office in this country
was the want of professional journeymen
to carry on their labour. Too much
was attempted to be done by the young
gentleman assistant, who failed to realise the
real nature of the business till he started as
a full fledged architect for himself. Speak-
ing of the value of the Exchange to trade,
Colonel Bennett said the institution would
be worth at least £50 a year to everyone of

them, and would soon put an end to shoddy
work and shoddy work prices. The public
confidence in the tradesmen and a better feeling would be
established between architects, surveyors, and
tradesmen all round. Mr. Cook, of the Glasgow Building Trades
Exchange, and Mr. John Laird, valuator,
Glasgow, also spoke. The Chairman having
called for an expression of opinion whether
the proposed Building Trades' Exchange
should be gone on with, Councillor Graham
formally moved that such an association should
be established for the encouragement and
protection of the building trades and
relative interests within the city of Edinburgh
and the county of Scotland. Such an insti-
tution, he said, was most desirable, because at
present there were no means by which
merchants and travellers, builders could meet and
transact business, except by their being
called on by the latter. Mr. Peter White
seconded, and the motion was unanimously
agreed to. The Chairman intimated that
the number of shares applied for was between
700 and 800, which augured pretty well for a
beginning. Colonel Bennett was thanked for
his lecture, and a committee of twenty-five
was appointed to forward the formation of the
Exchange. Mr. John Nisbet, solicitor, was
appointed interim secretary.
