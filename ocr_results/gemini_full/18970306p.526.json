He was assisted into the guard's van just as the train was moving off, and he became insensible immediately afterwards. On the arrival of the train at Bridge Street Mr. Hood was taken out of the carriage, and died while being conveyed to the waiting-room.\nThe deceased gentleman was 50 years of age. He had been medically attended during the last six months, but was always able to attend to the large saw-mill business of Arch. Hood & Co. Dr. Chalmers certified that death was due to cardiac disease.\nMr. Hood was very well known on the whole south side of Glasgow, more especially in Crosshill and Govanhill, through his business connection in Polmadie, and the announcement of his death was heard with feelings of deep regret. For the last three years he represented Govanhill on the School Board, and had again placed his services at the disposal of the ratepayers. He was a prominent member of the Liberal Association and of the Ward Committee, and took a deep interest in all public questions. He was generally respected.\n\nJAMES JONES\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\nLARBERT.\nEvery description of round and out-up Home Timber supplied for Collieries, Cartwrights, Coachbuilders, Boatbuilders, Shipbuilders, &c.\n\nMacEWAN & CO.\nTIMBER MERCHANTS,\nLILYBANK SAW-MILLS,\nSt. Andrews Rd,\nGLASGOW.\n\nA. & W.
