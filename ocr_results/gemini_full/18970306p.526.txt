OBITUARY.
MR. ARCHIBALD HOOD.
The sudden death of Mr. Archibald Hood, of the Polmadie Saw-mills, Glasgow, will be regretted by a large circle of friends.
He was taken ill on Tuesday in the Central Station while hurrying to catch the 1.20 train to Crosshill, Glasgow, on the 2nd inst. He was assisted into the guard's van just as the train was moving off, and he became insensible immediately afterwards. On the arrival of the train at Bridge Street Mr. Hood was taken out of the carriage, and died while being conveyed to the waiting-room.
The deceased gentleman was 50 years of age. He had been medically attended during the last six months, but was always able to attend to the large saw-mill business of Arch. Hood & Co. Dr. Chalmers certified that death was due to cardiac disease.
Mr. Hood was very well known on the whole south side of Glasgow, more especially in Crosshill and Govanhill, through his business connection in Polmadie, and the announcement of his death was heard with feelings of deep regret. For the last three years he represented Govanhill on the School Board, and had again placed his services at the disposal of the ratepayers. He was a prominent member of the Liberal Association and of the Ward Committee, and took a deep interest in all public questions. He was generally respected.
