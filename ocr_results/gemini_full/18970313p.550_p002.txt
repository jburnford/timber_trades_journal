FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BOOTH, HENRY, builder, Mawneys Road, Romford, 'iffd.'-The above-named debtor came up for his public examination at the last sitting of the Chelmsford Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Duffield. The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £735 17s. 5d., and a deficiency of £693 15s. 4d. Among the unsecured creditors were Messrs. W. Brown & Co, timber merchants, Ipswich, whose claim amounted to £153 6s. 9d. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver (Mr. Cecil Mercer), the debtor said that on December 15th, 1891, he was adjudged bankrupt at the Chelmsford Court, and subsequently paid a dividend of 2s. in the pound. He obtained his discharge on March 12th, 1896, and had commenced his present business again the preceding January. He was not aware that he contracted any debts between January and March, 1896. Since his previous bankruptcy he carried on business in his son's name, until he obtained his discharge. Only a few pounds were owing to Messrs. Brown in February; that was for some business relations with his son, who, as he said, went away in a "tiff" last June. After he had obtained his discharge debtor started business again with a capital of £25, but he had lost on all his contracts. His men were paid by the hour. "If a man worked only for an hour" said debtor, "and threw up his job, you have to go to pay him unless you can fight." (Laughter.) Mr. Mercer: A queer business to be in. Eventually the examination was adjourned.

CLARKE, WALTER, builder, 88, Glen Road, Abbeydale Road, Sheffield.-This debtor made an application for his discharge at the Sheffield County Court, before his Honour Judge Waddy. The Official Receiver said the receiving order was made on the 20th August, 1894, and the debtor made a statement of affairs, in which a surplus of £889 was shown. His assets, however, did not realise what they were expected to do, and the balance available for costs and distribution amongst unsecured creditors was £328 5s. 3d., instead of £3,176 0s. 9d., as estimated by the bankrupt. His first and final dividend, 1s. 0½d., was paid on proofs for £2,579 6s. 2d. Clarke was adjudicated bankrupt in 1883, and subsequently worked as a journeyman builder. He went to Sheffield in 1892 and commenced, without capital, to build houses. Mr. A. Muir Wilson said his client maintained that if the assets had been properly realised there would have been more than sufficient to pay all the creditors. The bankrupt had simply been interested in a building speculation. His Honour said that this was one of those cases which might very well be adjourned for the bankrupt or his friends to consider whether they were in a position to make any offer, which, in the opinion of the Official Receiver, was worthy of the recommendation to the Court for adoption. The matter was then adjourned in order that a scheme for the payment of 5s. in the pound may be brought before the Judge for his approval.
DALLIMORE, W. H., builder, 22, Castle Street, Long Acre, W.C.—The receiving order in this case was made on a creditor's petition, and the first statutory meeting was held last week before Mr. G. W. Chapman, Assistant Receiver. Accounts were filed showing liabilities £1,014 18s. 7d., of which £661 18s. 7d. were unsecured, and assets nil. The debtor states that he commenced business in September, 1887, with £240 capital, of which £200 was borrowed, and in November or December, 1894, he executed a deed of assignment for the benefit of his creditors. He now made no proposal, and his affairs will be wound up in bankruptcy, the Official Receiver acting as trustee.
FAIREY & HUMPHREY, lately trading as Fairey, Humphrey, & Co., timber merchants, 56, Bishopsgate Street Within, E.C. The receiving order in this case was made upon the petition of the Anglo-American Telegraph Company, Limited, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Friday, before Mr. G. W. Chapman, Assistant Receiver. It appeared from the statements of Mr. Humphrey

had for some years prior to January, 1894, he had no occupation, and mainly dependent upon an allowance from his father. He then joined Messrs. Richard Fairey & H. E. Crockford, who were carrying on business as timber merchants, agents, and brokers, at 1, St. Helen's Place, E.C., under the style of Fairey, Crockford, & Co. In the partnership it was stated to be £7,000, to be contributed as to £3,500 by Humphrey and £3,500 by Crockford. Fairey putting in no capital. In September, 1894, they removed to 55, and 56, Bishopsgate Street, and in March, 1895, Crockford withdrew on the ground that he had not brought in his share of capital. The firm had incurred heavy losses by bad debts. The dissolution was duly gazetted, and Fairey and Humphrey continued the business, the latter putting in a further sum of £3,500, also borrowed from his father. The business was carried down to September 1896, when, as it was proved unprofitable, a meeting of creditors was called, and a statement of affairs prepared showing liabilities £6,830 10s. 9d., and assets £5,108 5s. 5d. At an adjourned meeting held in November he (Humphrey) submitted an offer of 20s. in the pound, payable in 12 months, he taking over the liabilities and assets and continuing on his own account. All the creditors, with the exception of the petitioning creditors, assented, and a deed of arrangement was prepared. Fairey withdrew, and the dissolution was gazetted on November 14th. In addition to the joint indebtedness he (Humphrey) had separate liabilities amounting to £7,100, of which £7,000 was due to his father for money lent. The failure was ascribed to losses incurred in connection with advances against timber in Canada and the United States. The statutory accounts were not filed, but proofs of debts were made by the following creditors:-
... £ s. d.
Foy, Morgan & Co. .. .. .. .. 1,597 19 1

The meeting was adjourned for a fortnight in order that the debtors might bring forward a proposal.
JONES, THOMAS PUGH, contractor, and builders' merchant, 21, Mina Street, 18, Station Road, and Llangathen Yard, Llanelly.—This debtor came up for his public examination at the Carmarthen Bankruptcy Court on Thursday week before Mr. Registrar Parkinson. The statement of affairs showed (gross) amounting to £9,228 16s. 7d, and liabilities £1,835 13s. 2d. is expected to rank for dividend. In June, 1889, debtor commenced business as a builder and contractor at Llanelly, with a capital of £100. At his preliminary examination in January last he stated that he was not aware that he was insolvent, but his books now showed a deficiency of nearly £2,000. Five years ago he became surety with others for a local coal merchant for the payment of a composition of 20s. in the pound. An action was subsequently brought against the debtor to enforce the undertaking signed by him, the defence being that the undertaking had been obtained under false pretences and misleading statements. Eventually the action was compromised through the debtor paying £270 and costs. The debtor intends to offer a composition. Eventually the examination was ordered to be adjourned.
