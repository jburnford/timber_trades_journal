Biddie, C.I.E., F.Z.S., &c.:—\nEveryone knows how largely the serviceable qualities of a fishing rod depend on the kind of wood of which it is made, and it is in the hope of the above paper to notice briefly the more important woods at present used for this purpose, and to introduce to notice some Indian timbers which may prove as good or even better than, those at present employed. To produce high-class rods, the wood must not only have special natural qualities, but these must, so to speak, be brought out and fixed by long and careful seasoning; moreover, the same log may yield, from different sections, materials of very different value, a fact which necessitates careful testing and the rejection of unsuitable pieces. The woods most used at the present time in rod-making are, greenheart, washaba, blue mahoe, lancewood, hickory, ash, snakewood, and canes. Of all these, putting aside the canes, the chief favourite is—\nGreenheart, obtained from a laurel, the Nectandra Rodioei, the Bibiri tree of British Guiana, which attains a height of 60 to 70 feet. The timber is chiefly used for making pier piles and in shipbuilding. It is a heavy wood, having a specific gravity of 1, but no wood at present in use will furnish a more elegant and serviceable rod.\nWashaba, which also comes from British Guiana, is very like Greenheart but is heavier and more difficult to work.\nMahoe.—There are several trees to which this name is applied, found in various parts of the tropics. The species chiefly used in this country for rod-making is the Blue Mahoe (Paritium elatum) of Cuba and Jamaica, a very light, strong, and resilient wood. Its elasticity accounts for its being used in Cuba for springs for a two-wheeled cart called a \"Volante.\" The wood of the Indian Seaside-Mahoe or tul p tros Thespesia populnea) is worth a trial by rod makers.\n\nF.
