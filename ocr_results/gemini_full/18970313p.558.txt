Mr. James Key Caird, manufacturer, Dundee, has offered to provide the necessary sum to build a hospital for the treatment of diseases of women. The full details of the offer have not been disclosed, pending a conference between Mr. Caird and the chairman of directors of the Royal Infirmary, but an indication was given that in the first instance a sum of £5,000 would be placed at the disposal of the directors for the purpose.

The new part of the Combination Hospital, situated in the Linwood Road, Johnstone, was recently opened. The extensions have been executed to the plans of Mr. J. L. Cowan, of Glasgow, and have cost over £4,000. The contractors were:—For building, Keanie, Lochwinnoch; joiners, Purdon & Cuthbertson, Kilbarchan; plastering, M'Queeny, Glasgow; heating, M'Cormack & Son, Glasgow; painting, J. M'Connell, Johnstone; engineering and laundry work, Tullis & Co., Clydebank; slating, Marshall, Kilbarchan.

The Edinburgh Town Council have adopted a report by the Lord Provost's Committee recommending approval of elevation plans of buildings to be erected on both sides of North Bridge Street, by the authors of the design adjudged first (Messrs. Scott and Williamson), and failing satisfactory offers from outside parties, recommending that the Corporation should undertake the work of reconstruction, and craving a remit to instruct the preparation of working plans for the corner blocks; meantime, to obtain estimates for the work, and report.

An inquiry has been held into the scheme of the Bo'ness Police Commissioners for an additional water supply. The scheme is estimated to cost £17,000, exclusive of filters, &c.

INDIAN TIMBERS FOR FISHING RODS.

We publish below the abstract of a paper prepared from the Fishing Gazette, on woods at present used for making fishing rods, and on some Indian timbers which might be used as substitutes for those by Surgeon-General H. Biddie, C.I.E., F.Z.S., &c.:—
Everyone knows how largely the serviceable qualities of a fishing rod depend on the kind of wood of which it is made, and it is in the hope of the above paper to notice briefly the more important woods at present used for this purpose, and to introduce to notice some Indian timbers which may prove as good or even better than, those at present employed. To produce high-class rods, the wood must not only have special natural qualities, but these must, so to speak, be brought out and fixed by long and careful seasoning; moreover, the same log may yield, from different sections, materials of very different value, a fact which necessitates careful testing and the rejection of unsuitable pieces. The woods most used at the present time in rod-making are, greenheart, washaba, blue mahoe, lancewood, hickory, ash, snakewood, and canes. Of all these, putting aside the canes, the chief favourite is—
Greenheart, obtained from a laurel, the Nectandra Rodioei, the Bibiri tree of British Guiana, which attains a height of 60 to 70 feet. The timber is chiefly used for making pier piles and in shipbuilding. It is a heavy wood, having a specific gravity of 1, but no wood at present in use will furnish a more elegant and serviceable rod.
Washaba, which also comes from British Guiana, is very like Greenheart but is heavier and more difficult to work.
Mahoe.—There are several trees to which this name is applied, found in various parts of the tropics. The species chiefly used in this country for rod-making is the Blue Mahoe (Paritium elatum) of Cuba and Jamaica, a very light, strong, and resilient wood. Its elasticity accounts for its being used in Cuba for springs for a two-wheeled cart called a "Volante." The wood of the Indian Seaside-Mahoe or tul p tros Thespesia populnea) is worth a trial by rod makers.
