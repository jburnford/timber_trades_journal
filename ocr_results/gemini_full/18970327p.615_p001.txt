last year within £200, cash at bankers and in hand is likewise almost the same.
You will notice that, although £1,000 has been expended on new plant during the year, the amount standing to account at freeholds, plant, and fixtures has been reduced by £300, which I think is satisfactory, seeing that every year there is a considerable sum charged to revenue for renewals, repairs, &c., to keep everything up as exactly up to the mark.
I now beg to move the adoption of the report and balance-sheet."
The motion was then put, and carried unanimously.
The Chairman next moved, "That a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum be paid on the ordinary shares for the past year."
Mr. Pannell seconded, and the motion was carried.—An extraordinary general meeting was then held to pass a resolution authorising the directors to borrow £60,000 upon first mortgage debentures of the company.
The Chairman moved the following resolution:—"Resolved, that the directors be, and they are hereby, authorised to borrow a sum not exceeding £60,000 for the purpose of paying off the debentures of the company which fall due on November 1, 1897, and for other purposes of the company, and that such sum be raised by the issue of new debentures, payable on November 1st, 1907, and bearing interest in the meantime, not exceeding 4 1/2 per cent. per annum, and in such form, and to be secured in such manner, and to be issued to such persons and on such terms as the directors think expedient."
Mr. C. R. E. Bell, the managing director, in seconding the resolution, said he had devoted a great deal of time to the establishment of the two Colonial factories, and he was surprised to hear the remarks made by a shareholder in regard to mismanagement.
The resolution was then put and carried unanimously.
A vote of thanks to the Chairman closed the proceedings.
OUR SPECIAL ISSUE.—The Newcastle Daily Journal says:—We have received the 23rd special issue of the Timber Trades Journal, a valuable issue of the which contains, besides a review of the publication, special articles (including particulars of a number of important timber-dealing firms), and an exhaustive account of the wood industries of Canada, which is profusely illustrated, and written by special correspondents who have evidently been personally acquainted with and have had experience in the various districts about which they deal so lucidly.
Then there is a special issue, in the first of which is given a review of the general timber trade of the United Kingdom, home, foreign, and engineering sections of the trade, all the principal ports of the United Kingdom.
To all engaged in the timber trade this special number will prove a source of useful information which the shrewd business man may turn to practical advantage.

A LIVERPOOL FIRM'S HANDIWORK.
The Electrical and Engineering and General Trades and Art Exhibition, which was recently opened at Newcastle by the Mayor of that city, promises to be one of the most successful exhibitions ever held in the engineering metropolis.
The site of the exhibition buildings is situated in what is at its best but an unlovely district, but on arrival in Northumberland Road the eye is relieved by the fine appearance presented by the handsome structure which contains the exhibits.
A large portion of land is allotted for the purposes of the exhibition, and the really attractive group of buildings erected thereon by Messrs. Bruce & Still, of Liverpool, for which that firm is so well known throughout the country.
In passing, it may be stated that the firm obtained a gold medal in connection with the erection of handsome quarters for the Sunderland Exhibition of 1895.
One might almost say that the Northumberland Road site has grown into "a thing of beauty and a joy," if not "for ever," at least during the life of the exhibition.
The buildings are erected on made land, the main portion consisting of corrugated iron, and the whole structure is of a very substantial character, extremely neat in appearance, and wonderfully comfortable inside.
It is the largest building of this kind, and covers about an acre and a half of ground.
It absorbed upwards of 200 tons of iron, steel, timber, &c. in its construction, and it will

show the great resources of Messrs. Bruce & Still when we mention that the work was not started until the 1st of December, and the contract was completed by the end of January.
Once inside, the visitor is struck with the roomy appearance of the halls and the variety of the exhibits.
During the day the place is well lighted from the roof, and at night is almost dazzling with numerous electric lights.
The exhibits include machinery in motion, cycles and cycle-fittings, and miscellaneous mechanical appliances of almost every conceivable utility.
The sketch of the building, which appears above, shows the pleasing effect of the whole, and gives one a good idea of the work which has been so well executed by Messrs. Bruce & Still.—Liverpool Journal of Commerce.
