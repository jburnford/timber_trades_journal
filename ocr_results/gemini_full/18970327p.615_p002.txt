FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BASTER, FREDERICK GEORGE
Builder and ship-carpenter, Lorne Park Road, Kirkley, and Oulton Broad, Norfolk.—This debtor came up for his public examination at the Yarmouth Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday last. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £190 19s. 4d., and a deficiency of £179 14s. 4d. Bankrupt said he began business ten years ago without capital, and kept no books whatever, as he had only a repairing business. He lost his first and his second wife furnished a house and lodgings. His insolvency was due to bad debts and losses on contracts. He knew that he was behind in 1895, and he borrowed £25 off his wife, with which he had paid of pressing creditors. Last June he contracted to build a wherry for £170 for the Lowestoft East Coast Ice Company. This was to be paid in instalments, and a considerable part of his liabilities was for material purchased for the wherry. The first instalment, £90, he used to pay off debts previously contracted, and the men for labour, the people who found the materials for the wherry losing their money. Since January he had only done a fortnight's work, and his only assets were his tools. He filed his petition on receiving a writ from Messrs. Saul. Eventually the examination was ordered to be closed.
BOWEN, EVAN, joiner, 13, Court Street, Tonypandy.—The public examination of this debtor was held on Tuesday last at the Pontypridd Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £278 19s. 9d., and assets estimated to produce £14 11s., thus leaving a deficiency of £264 8s. 9d. Debtor alleged that he lost £155 through building three houses by contract at Glynfach Vale. One of his debts amounted to £216, and has been accumulating since 1894. Eventually the debtor was allowed to pass his examination.
CHRISTMAS & CARTWRIGHT
Packing case makers and carpenters, Suffolk Place, Snow Fields, S.E.—The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held last week before Mr. E. L. Hough, Official Receiver. Accounts were furnished showing unsecured debts £884 14s. 4d., and debts partly secured £292 10s. (the securities being valued at £130), and assets £245 11s. 8d., after deducting £16 8s. 4d. for preferential payments. The following were scheduled as creditors :—

(Security valued at £130.)
The debtors commenced business in 1890, with a joint capital of about £100, and about a year ago took additional premises in Commercial Fields, which they fitted up at a cost of about £120. In this they were assisted to the extent of £70 by Mr. J. J. Chalk, of 12, Commercial Road, E. They had surrendered the lease of the Suffolk Street. One pledging creditor was closed, it appearing that for about four months since December last the timber with Messrs. Raffety, the lenders, Mildmay Chambers, E.C., which was worth £450, was pledged. The debtors made no proposal, and it would therefore be well for the creditors decided whether to appoint an outside trustee with a committee, or leave the matter in the hands of the Official Receiver.
COATES, JOSEPH
Contractor, Marton-in-Cleveland.—The debtor made an application at the Stockton Court on Tuesday for his discharge. He was adjudicated a bankrupt in October, 1895. The Official Receiver's report stated that the debtor's assets, which were estimated to produce £200, were only lodged at £100. The proofs were estimated to produce £200, owing to a contract with another debtor to carry stone from the South Bank realising only £100 instead of £200 estimated, they had been met of 16s. 10d. in the pound. A committee of investigation had been appointed, and the debtor had given every assistance in the realisation of his estate. He attributed the application for his discharge to the fact that if the debtor had not been made a bankruptcy he would have been able to pay his creditors in full. Mr. T. M. Barron, for the debtor, asked for his discharge, but his Honour suspended the discharge, remarking that if the debtor could pay another 3s. 2d. in the pound, the bankruptcy would be annulled.
DELLA ROCCA
Lambeth Walk, S.E.—The first meeting of creditors was held in this matter on Tuesday. Mr. E. L. Hough, Official Receiver, stated that he has traded in Lambeth Walk, and he attributed his failure to excess of expenses over profits. The accounts showed debts, £1,100, and assets, £36 7s. 6d. creditors include :—Mr. Forman, timber merchant, Walworth, S.E. for £22 12s. 6d. The case being one of bankruptcy, Official Receiver remains trustee.

In reply to the chairman the debtors stated that they were unable to make any offer, as they had intended, and consequently the application. Mr. H. W. Bayne, of 101, Leadenhall Street, E.C., was therefore appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. W. W. Morgan (Foy, Morgan & Co.), Mr. Herbert Gibson (Deacon, Gibson & Co.), and Mr. H. H. Ruffer, security to be given by the trustee to the amount of £2,000.
