Garland & Roger, whilst the other shipments are divided among various importers.\nMr. D. W. Beattie held a public sale of American and Baltic wood goods on Tuesday, 23rd inst., at the Edinburgh Dock.\nThe American goods, which consisted of Canary whitewood logs and boards and yellow pine deals, were neglected, the prices not coming up to exposers’ limits, and goods were withdrawn.\nThere was a much better demand for the Baltic deals and battens, and a fair overturn of those goods resulted.\nFor the high-class Petersburg red and white wood of various dimensions good prices were got, 6½ x 2½ best red deals fetching 1½d. and white 1 1/8d. per lineal foot.\nA cargo of Norwegian 2 in. scantlings just landed was cleared from quay at fairly satisfactory factory prices, in view of quality and saving of storage charges.\n\nIMPORTS.\nALLOA.\nMar. 17 Argo-Tonsberg-140 lds. props-Fife Coal Co.\nBud-Christiania-179 lds. props-Donibristle Colliery Co.\nTromso-Porsgrund-270 lds. props-M.

Shaw, the president, occupied the chair.\nThere were about 70 gentlemen present, including Lord Dean of Guild Paul.\nIn proposing \"The Building Trade,\" said the building trades of the city had for some time been very prosperous, and it was a pleasure to think that, for a considerable time to come, there was likelihood to be as prosperous times for these trades.\nWithin the past fortnight applications had been made to the Town Council for the opening up of four or five new streets in Dundee, which showed there was a considerable boom in the building trade for a year or two.\nThe Chairman, in responding, acknowledged that the building trade had been very prosperous during the past year.\nWhen he came to Dundee about fifteen years ago he worked sixty hours per week for 10s., and he was now paying men £1 for fifty-one hours.\nProvisions were as cheap now as they were then, but house rents were dearer.\nAbout forty years ago they would have got two rooms in Dundee for £2 or £2 10s., but they would now have to pay £8 or £9 for that accomodation.\nThere was no doubt that the high wages paid to the men in the building trade raised the price of property, but there were many trades in the city in which the wages had not risen in the same proportion.\nHowever, he hoped that good trade would continue, for there was nothing more satisfactory to masters and men than that there should be plenty of work.\n\nGAZETTE.\nESTATE SEQUESTRATED.\nWELSH, WM., van builder, 5, Sunnyside Road, Glasgow, sole partner of W.
