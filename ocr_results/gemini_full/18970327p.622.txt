Since last report there are the following arrivals, viz:—322 loads oak staves and 30 pieces ash, per “Lortona” (s), from Libau; 16,827 battens, per “Glitra” (s), from Namsos; 79 logs poplar and 924 pieces ash and poplar lumber, per “Newstead” (s), from Baltimore; 30 pieces oak, per “Dresden” (s), from Stettin; 3,120 oak staves, 50 birch logs, and 150 sleepers, per “Buda” (s), from Libau.
The cargo of battens per “Glitra” (s) is for Messrs. Garland & Roger, whilst the other shipments are divided among various importers.
Mr. D. W. Beattie held a public sale of American and Baltic wood goods on Tuesday, 23rd inst., at the Edinburgh Dock.
The American goods, which consisted of Canary whitewood logs and boards and yellow pine deals, were neglected, the prices not coming up to exposers’ limits, and goods were withdrawn.
There was a much better demand for the Baltic deals and battens, and a fair overturn of those goods resulted.
For the high-class Petersburg red and white wood of various dimensions good prices were got, 6½ x 2½ best red deals fetching 1½d. and white 1 1/8d. per lineal foot.
A cargo of Norwegian 2 in. scantlings just landed was cleared from quay at fairly satisfactory factory prices, in view of quality and saving of storage charges.

DUNDEE MASTER BUILDERS' ASSOCIATION DINNER.
The annual dinner of the Dundee Master Builders' Association was held in the Queen's Hotel, and Mr. John F. Shaw, the president, occupied the chair.
There were about 70 gentlemen present, including Lord Dean of Guild Paul.
In proposing "The Building Trade," said the building trades of the city had for some time been very prosperous, and it was a pleasure to think that, for a considerable time to come, there was likelihood to be as prosperous times for these trades.
Within the past fortnight applications had been made to the Town Council for the opening up of four or five new streets in Dundee, which showed there was a considerable boom in the building trade for a year or two.
The Chairman, in responding, acknowledged that the building trade had been very prosperous during the past year.
When he came to Dundee about fifteen years ago he worked sixty hours per week for 10s., and he was now paying men £1 for fifty-one hours.
Provisions were as cheap now as they were then, but house rents were dearer.
About forty years ago they would have got two rooms in Dundee for £2 or £2 10s., but they would now have to pay £8 or £9 for that accomodation.
There was no doubt that the high wages paid to the men in the building trade raised the price of property, but there were many trades in the city in which the wages had not risen in the same proportion.
However, he hoped that good trade would continue, for there was nothing more satisfactory to masters and men than that there should be plenty of work.

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
In the Outer House of the Court of Session, Edinburgh, before Lord Kincairney, the other week, proof was allowed in an action by William Anderson & Co., timber merchants, 172, Buchanan Street, Glasgow, against John Fletcher, May Villa, Kinghorn.
The pursuers ask that the defender should be ordained to deliver 860 sleepers, removed from the steamer "Glenholme," sunk in the Sound of Hurn, or to pay £250.
The defender does not deny that the sleepers belong to the pursuers, but he refuses delivery on the ground that he has a claim for salvage, in having raised them from the bottom of the sea, and he retains them in virtue of his maritime lien.
Lord Kincairney said it was impossible to determine whether the defender had rendered salvage services or not, without inquiry, unless the parties compromised the case, and there must be a proof.
