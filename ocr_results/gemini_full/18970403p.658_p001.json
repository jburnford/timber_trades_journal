The site of the exhibition buildings is situated in what is at its best but an unlovely district, but on arrival in Northumberland Road the eye is relieved by the fine appearance presented by the handsome structure which contains the exhibits. A large portion of Northumberland is allotted to the really attractive group of buildings erected for the purposes of the exhibition, and the whole of the work is the idea of the work which has been so well executed by Messrs. Bruce & Still, of Liverpool, is another of those triumphs of skill of which the Journal of Commerce...\n\nfor which that firm is so well known throughout the country. In passing, it may be stated that the firm obtained a gold medal in connection with the erection of handsome quarters for the Sunderland Exhibition of 1895. One might almost say that the Northumberland Road site has grown into “a thing of beauty and a joy,” if not “for ever,” at least during the life of the exhibition. The buildings are erected on made land, the main portion consisting of corrugated iron, and the whole structure is of a very substantial character, extremely neat in appearance, and wonderfully comfortable inside. It is the largest building of this kind, and covers about an acre and a half of ground. It absorbed upwards of 200 tons of iron, steel, timber, &c. in its construction, and it will show the great resources of Messrs. Bruce & Still when we mention that the work was not started until the 21st of December, and the contract was completed by the end of January. Once inside, the visitor is struck with the roomy appearance of the halls and the variety of the exhibits. During the day the place is well lighted from the roof, and at night is almost dazzling with numerous electric lights. The exhibits include machinery in motion, cycles and cycle fittings, and miscellaneous mechanical appliances of almost every conceivable utility. The sketch of the building, which appears above, shows the pleasing effect of the whole, and gives one a good idea of the work which has been so well executed by Messrs. Bruce and Still.—Liverpool Journal of Commerce.\n\nIMPORTS.\nWhere no name is appended to the imports below it is understood that the consignments are to “Order.”\n\nBLYTH.\nMar. 23 Fia-Uddevalla-258 pcs. mining timber\n\nBOSTON.\nMar. 23 Adjuton-Arendal-260 lds. hewn fir-Alderson & English\n24 Nepoter-Fredrikstrard-262 lds. hewn fir-Alderson & English\n\nBRISTOL.\nMar. 25 Finland-Fredrikshald 6,808 skirtings, 51,990 boards-T.
