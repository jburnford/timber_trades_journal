The site of the exhibition is well situated in what is at present a comparatively district, but on the Northumberland Road the eye is at once arrested by the fine appearance presented by the handsome structure which contains the exhibits. A large portion of land is allotted for the purposes of the exhibition, and the really attractive group of buildings erected thereon by Messrs. Bruce & Still, of Liverpool, is another of those triumphs of skill\n\nIMPORTS.\nWhere no name is appended to the Importer's name it is understood that the consignments are to \"Order.\"\nBOSTON\nMar. 31 Lidskialf-Arendal-1,250 lds. hewn fir, 11 lds. firewood-Alderson & English\nBRIDGWATER\nApril 5 Harmonia-Fredrikshald-451 lds. sawn fir-Colthurst & Co.\nBRISTOL\nApril 5 Chicago City (s)-New York-264 pcs. lumbe.-May & Hassell.\n6 Union (s) - Fredrikstad-34,746 bdls. box boards-J Lysaght-16,272 bdls. box boards-Lawson & Co.; 2,000 bdls. box boards-Walker Bros.\nIlmatar-Fredrikstad-79,519 floorings, 1,088 bdls. laths-Ines & Wal[?]\nAVONMOUTH\nApril 1 Lycia (s)-Portland, Me-14,183 spruce deals-Price, Walker, & Co.\nStrathnairn (s)-Norfolk, Va-333 pcs. cedar planks-G.

In passing, it may be stated that the firm obtained a gold medal in connection with the erection of handsome quarters for the Sunderland Exhibition of 1895. One might almost say that the Northumberland Road site has grown into \"a thing of beauty and a joy,\" if not \"for ever,\" at least during the life of the exhibition. The buildings are erected on made land, the main portion consisting of corrugated iron, and the whole structure is of a very substantial character, extremely neat in appearance, and wonderfully comfortable inside. It is the largest building of this kind, and covers about an acre and a half of ground. It absorbed upwards of 200 tons of iron, steel, timber, &c., in its construction, and it will\nGaronne-Bordeaux-700 lds. pitwood-W. R.

Bruce & Still when we mention that the work was not started until the 1st of December, and the contract was completed by the end of January. Once inside, the visitor is struck with the roomy appearance of the halls and the variety of the exhibits. During the day the place is well lighted from the roof, and at night is most dazzling with numerous electric lights. The exhibits include machinery in motion, cycles and cycle-fittings, and miscellaneous mechanical appliances of almost every conceivable utility. The sketch of the building which appears above shows the pleasing effect of the whole, and gives one a good idea of the work which has been so well executed by Messrs.
