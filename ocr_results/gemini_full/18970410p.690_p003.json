  "text": "THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nAPRIL 10, 1897.\n\nGAZETTE.\n\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nBATES AND STEVENS, builders, Willesden Green, N.W.—This failure occurred in November last, and the bankrupts applied on Wednesday for their discharge.\nThe assets had realised £152 11s. 7d., and about £50 further was expected to be received.\nIt appeared that they had built some twelve builders in partnership, commencing in June, 1894, with a capital of £15, and they had since built about forty houses, mostly at Willesden Green, at a total cost of £9,000 or £10,000.\nIt was reported that they had not kept proper books of account, and that they had been brought on their bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculations.\nHis Honour suspended the discharge for two years.\n\nBRYANT, GEORGE FRANCIS, contractor, New Bridge Road, Bristol.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor was appointed to be held on Friday last at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Harley, but nothing further of importance transpired, and eventually the debtor was allowed to pass.\n\nBUNNETT, ARTHUR HENRY, trading as A. H. Bunnett, revolving shutter maker, Crown Works, Tanner’s Hill, Deptford.—The Official Receiver’s observations herein are—The receiving order was made on the 21st ult. on a creditor’s petition, the act of bankruptcy being the non-compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice, duly served upon him on the 15th January last.\nThe debtor has been adjudicated bankrupt, and an order for the summary administration of the estate has been applied for.\nThe debtor states that he commenced the revolving shutter maker about the year 1874, but without capital, and that in or about August, 1894, he removed his business to Crown Works, Tanner’s Hill, Deptford (which he took on a 14 years’ lease from September, 1894, at a rent of £33 a year), where he continued to trade under the style of “A. H. Bunnett & Co.” up to the 8th ult., when the whole of his effects at this place were sold by the High Bailiff of the Greenwich County Court under an execution levied at the suit of one of his creditors.\nThe debtor has not up to the present filed a statement of his affairs, but it would appear that his unsecured liabilities amount to between £700 and £800, and that his only free assets consist of book debts stated to be of the face value of about £50.\nThe debtor attributes his insolvency to bad trade since 1894, to losses during 1894, 1895, and 1896, of £200 through the sale of his effects on the 8th February last.\nThe only balance-sheet made by him during the last three years was a very rough one, prepared about twelve months ago, and that the only statement of his assets and liabilities made during the same period was one got out about three months ago, when that the statement as to his assets did not appear that about 21 years ago, when trading as \"A. H. Bunnett, at Railway Arches, Deptford,\n\nAUSTRIAN WAINSCOT\nJ. H. ROWNTREE, 30, Great St. Helens, LONDON. E.C.\nTELEGRAMS —“ GRACENOTE, LONDON.”\n\na petition was filed in the Greenwich County Court to liquidate the debtor’s affairs, and under these proceedings, the debtor states, no dividend was paid, and that he has not obtained his discharge.\nI shall be glad to receive further information from creditors as to the debtor’s conduct and affairs.\n\nCHEVERELL, CHAS., builder, 65, Hassett Road, Homerton, N.E.—The receiving order in this case was made in October, 1894, upon the joint petition of Mr. P. G. Sturges, timber merchant, Eldon Street, E.C., and Jemima C. Base, builder, High Street, Stratford, and the bankrupt applied on Wednesday to Mr. Registrar Giffard for an order of discharge.\nThe liabilities were returned at £212 15s., but the Official Receiver estimated the total unsecured indebtedness at £150.\nThe only asset disclosed was an equity of redemption valued at £130, but nothing had been realised therefrom.\nThe Official Receiver had, however, realised the sum of £127 3s. 3d. from other sources.\nIt appeared that the debtor had carried on business from 1877 down to the date of the receiving order, and the Official Receiver reported that he had not kept proper books of account, and that he had brought on his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation.\nHis Honour suspended the order of discharge for two years.\n\nCHRISTMAS & CARTWRIGHT, packing-case makers and carpenters, 33, Sun Street, E.C., and Suffolk Place, Bermondsey.—A sitting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard, the accounts showing liabilities £1,022 4s. 4d., and assets £245 11s. 8d., after providing for preferential payments.\nChristmas was first examined, and stated, in reply to the Official Receiver, that he began business in August, 1890, in partnership with Cartwright, with a joint capital of £25.\nThey had both been previously in the employment of Mr. Bowman, the former proprietor of the business.\nThey started in Sun Street, Finsbury, and in August, 1891, took additional premises at Suffolk Place, Bermondsey.\nThey traded at both places until December last, when they gave up the Sun Street premises.\nOwing to want of capital they dealt exclusively for three years with Mr. Chalk, timber merchant, and in trying to get out of that arrangement the result was that they had to pay excessive interest on borrowed money.\nThey also incurred an expenditure of £150 in moving from one yard in Suffolk Place to another.\nIn July last they found they were insolvent, and they had since contracted further liabilities of £612.\nTheir drawings were £2 a week each.\nIn December last a parcel of timber to the value of £170 was invoiced to them by Mr. Louis Bamberger.\nThis order for the timber was given six months previously, and they would have got out of the delivery had they been allowed to do so.\nThey deposited £45 worth of the timber with Messrs. Joyce & Co. as security for an advance of £35, which they required to enable them to meet another bill given to Mr. Bamberger, and to keep them going.\nThey regarded the pledging as a temporary arrangement, and had certainly no intention to defraud Mr. Bamberger.\nThe bankrupt was then examined regarding the sale of a boiler to Mr. Vigers, a timber merchant, and he said that they only parted with the boiler as security for Mr. Vigers’ debt, upon the understanding that it would be theirs again when the debt was paid.\nThe examination of both the bankrupts was concluded.\n\nDAY, J., builder, 32, Park Road, East Acton.—The above-named debtor came up for his public examination at the last sitting of the Brentford Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Ruston.\nThe statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £687.\nIn answer to questions, the debtor said he had carried on business as a builder in Chiswick, Fulham, and Hammersmith, and had contracted most of his debts in building speculations.\nHe had no capital, and his only expectation of paying his debts was by a successful realisation of his properties.\nIn each case where he had commenced building operations the money to carry on the work had been advanced by the freeholders, who took possession when he was unable to repay the loan.\nPrevious to 1894, when he commenced speculating, he had been engaged as an agent at Shepherd’s Bush, and during the time he held that situation he acquired all the practical knowledge of building which he possessed.\nHe did considerable work at Turnham Green, where he erected a number of\n\nAPRIL 10, 1897.\nHills Plymouth Co.

A., builder, 323, Coldharbour Lane, Brixton, S.W.—The debtor, trading as Howard Bros., has presented his petition, and last week, upon the application of Messrs. Langlois & Co., the usual receiving order was made.\nThe liabilities are returned at about £600, with assets consisting of stock to the value of about £60 and book debts of £150.\nThe debtor stated that he was building at Tooting and Norwood Road, and on the hands employed.\nHe had some house property which was mortgaged.\n\nLEWIS, THOMAS, timber merchant, Lion House, Hay.—This debtor came up for his public examination at the Hereford Bankruptcy Court on Friday last, before Mr. Registrar Garless.\nThe statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £279 1s. 4d., of which £255 13s. 9d. was expected to rank, and assets, after deducting preferential claims, to £50 6s. 5d., thus leaving a deficiency of £205 7s. 4d.\nIn answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor said he commenced business in 1894.\nHe was well acquainted with that kind of business, because he had previously been in the employ of a firm who did a good trade.\nHe was aware that he could not pay his debts last year, but he continued to trade because his returns were better each month.\nThe larger part of his debts were for goods supplied in the timber trade.\nHe attributed his insolvency to the fact that he had no capital when he commenced business, and his trade since had been insufficient to pay expenses.\nThe examination was eventually ordered to be adjourned.\n\nREES, THOMAS (lately trading as Rees & Co.), contractor and merchant, late timber merchant, Merthyr Vale, and Llanbradach, and now of Glan Buildings, Cardiff, Glam.—Under this recent failure accounts have been filed showing liabilities to unsecured creditors £8,817 19s. 9s., to fully secured creditors £12,030 1s. 8d., estimated value of securities £20,150 19s., surplus of £8,120 17s. 4d. carried to contra.\nTo partly secured creditors £815 13s. 6d., less estimated value of securities £264, which leaves £551 13s. 6d. to rank.\nLiabilities on bills £400, to preferential creditors £2 4s. 7d.\nTotal, £9,813 9s. 3d., and assets, consisting of cash in hand, £11,588 16s. 6d., cash deposited with solicitor £10, machinery and plant at quarry £1,000; office furniture £10; other property, plant, shares, &c., £1,375 1s. 6d., book debts £1,129 9s. 4d., surplus from securities £8,120 17s. 4d., making total assets £11,588 17s. 4d. less £118 4s. 5d. for preferential claims, which leaves £11,470 12s. 11d., showing a surplus of £1,657 3s. 9d.\nThe following are the principal creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nAston, T., & Sons, Pontypridd .. .. 25 4 0\nAberdare & Plymouth Co., Ltd., Aberdare 38 1 8\nBristol & South Wales Railway Wagon Co., Bristol .. .. .. .. .. 33 10 0\nBaker, W., & Co., Newport .. .. 4 3 6\nBrown, J., & Co., London .. .. 73 11 6\nBoulton & Paul, Norwich .. .. .. 47 3 1\nBurgess, E., & Co., Tunstall .. .. 106 15 8\nBryneoch Brick Co., Taffs Well .. .. 29 0 0\nBruce, R., & Co., Liverpool .. .. 37 15 4\nBell, Hartley, & Co., Cardiff .. .. 153 3 5\nCross Bros., Cardiff .. .. .. 27 8 1\nCattybrook Brick Co., Bristol .. .. 128 7 1\nCorfield, son, & Co., Cardiff .. .. 103 18 1\nCarr, G.
