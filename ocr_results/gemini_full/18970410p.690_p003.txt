FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BATES AND STEVENS, builders, Willesden Green, N.W.—This failure occurred in November last, and the bankrupts applied on Wednesday for their discharge.
The assets had realised £152 11s. 7d., and about £50 further was expected to be received.
It appeared that they had built some twelve builders in partnership, commencing in June, 1894, with a capital of £15, and they had since built about forty houses, mostly at Willesden Green, at a total cost of £9,000 or £10,000.
It was reported that they had not kept proper books of account, and that they had been brought on their bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculations.
His Honour suspended the discharge for two years.

BRYANT, GEORGE FRANCIS, contractor, New Bridge Road, Bristol.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor was appointed to be held on Friday last at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Harley, but nothing further of importance transpired, and eventually the debtor was allowed to pass.

BUNNETT, ARTHUR HENRY, trading as A. H. Bunnett, revolving shutter maker, Crown Works, Tanner’s Hill, Deptford.—The Official Receiver’s observations herein are—The receiving order was made on the 21st ult. on a creditor’s petition, the act of bankruptcy being the non-compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice, duly served upon him on the 15th January last.
The debtor has been adjudicated bankrupt, and an order for the summary administration of the estate has been applied for.
The debtor states that he commenced the revolving shutter maker about the year 1874, but without capital, and that in or about August, 1894, he removed his business to Crown Works, Tanner’s Hill, Deptford (which he took on a 14 years’ lease from September, 1894, at a rent of £33 a year), where he continued to trade under the style of “A. H. Bunnett & Co.” up to the 8th ult., when the whole of his effects at this place were sold by the High Bailiff of the Greenwich County Court under an execution levied at the suit of one of his creditors.
The debtor has not up to the present filed a statement of his affairs, but it would appear that his unsecured liabilities amount to between £700 and £800, and that his only free assets consist of book debts stated to be of the face value of about £50.
The debtor attributes his insolvency to bad trade since 1894, to losses during 1894, 1895, and 1896, of £200 through the sale of his effects on the 8th February last.
The only balance-sheet made by him during the last three years was a very rough one, prepared about twelve months ago, and that the only statement of his assets and liabilities made during the same period was one got out about three months ago, when that the statement as to his assets did not appear that about 21 years ago, when trading as "A. H. Bunnett, at Railway Arches, Deptford,

a petition was filed in the Greenwich County Court to liquidate the debtor’s affairs, and under these proceedings, the debtor states, no dividend was paid, and that he has not obtained his discharge.
I shall be glad to receive further information from creditors as to the debtor’s conduct and affairs.

CHEVERELL, CHAS., builder, 65, Hassett Road, Homerton, N.E.—The receiving order in this case was made in October, 1894, upon the joint petition of Mr. P. G. Sturges, timber merchant, Eldon Street, E.C., and Jemima C. Base, builder, High Street, Stratford, and the bankrupt applied on Wednesday to Mr. Registrar Giffard for an order of discharge.
The liabilities were returned at £212 15s., but the Official Receiver estimated the total unsecured indebtedness at £150.
The only asset disclosed was an equity of redemption valued at £130, but nothing had been realised therefrom.
The Official Receiver had, however, realised the sum of £127 3s. 3d. from other sources.
It appeared that the debtor had carried on business from 1877 down to the date of the receiving order, and the Official Receiver reported that he had not kept proper books of account, and that he had brought on his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation.
His Honour suspended the order of discharge for two years.

CHRISTMAS & CARTWRIGHT, packing-case makers and carpenters, 33, Sun Street, E.C., and Suffolk Place, Bermondsey.—A sitting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard, the accounts showing liabilities £1,022 4s. 4d., and assets £245 11s. 8d., after providing for preferential payments.
Christmas was first examined, and stated, in reply to the Official Receiver, that he began business in August, 1890, in partnership with Cartwright, with a joint capital of £25.
They had both been previously in the employment of Mr. Bowman, the former proprietor of the business.
They started in Sun Street, Finsbury, and in August, 1891, took additional premises at Suffolk Place, Bermondsey.
They traded at both places until December last, when they gave up the Sun Street premises.
Owing to want of capital they dealt exclusively for three years with Mr. Chalk, timber merchant, and in trying to get out of that arrangement the result was that they had to pay excessive interest on borrowed money.
They also incurred an expenditure of £150 in moving from one yard in Suffolk Place to another.
In July last they found they were insolvent, and they had since contracted further liabilities of £612.
Their drawings were £2 a week each.
In December last a parcel of timber to the value of £170 was invoiced to them by Mr. Louis Bamberger.
This order for the timber was given six months previously, and they would have got out of the delivery had they been allowed to do so.
They deposited £45 worth of the timber with Messrs. Joyce & Co. as security for an advance of £35, which they required to enable them to meet another bill given to Mr. Bamberger, and to keep them going.
They regarded the pledging as a temporary arrangement, and had certainly no intention to defraud Mr. Bamberger.
The bankrupt was then examined regarding the sale of a boiler to Mr. Vigers, a timber merchant, and he said that they only parted with the boiler as security for Mr. Vigers’ debt, upon the understanding that it would be theirs again when the debt was paid.
The examination of both the bankrupts was concluded.

DAY, J., builder, 32, Park Road, East Acton.—The above-named debtor came up for his public examination at the last sitting of the Brentford Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Ruston.
The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £687.
In answer to questions, the debtor said he had carried on business as a builder in Chiswick, Fulham, and Hammersmith, and had contracted most of his debts in building speculations.
He had no capital, and his only expectation of paying his debts was by a successful realisation of his properties.
In each case where he had commenced building operations the money to carry on the work had been advanced by the freeholders, who took possession when he was unable to repay the loan.
Previous to 1894, when he commenced speculating, he had been engaged as an agent at Shepherd’s Bush, and during the time he held that situation he acquired all the practical knowledge of building which he possessed.
He did considerable work at Turnham Green, where he erected a number of

Eventually the examination was ordered to be adjourned.

EDWARD, W. A., builder, 323, Coldharbour Lane, Brixton, S.W.—The debtor, trading as Howard Bros., has presented his petition, and last week, upon the application of Messrs. Langlois & Co., the usual receiving order was made.
The liabilities are returned at about £600, with assets consisting of stock to the value of about £60 and book debts of £150.
The debtor stated that he was building at Tooting and Norwood Road, and on the hands employed.
He had some house property which was mortgaged.

LEWIS, THOMAS, timber merchant, Lion House, Hay.—This debtor came up for his public examination at the Hereford Bankruptcy Court on Friday last, before Mr. Registrar Garless.
The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £279 1s. 4d., of which £255 13s. 9d. was expected to rank, and assets, after deducting preferential claims, to £50 6s. 5d., thus leaving a deficiency of £205 7s. 4d.
In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor said he commenced business in 1894.
He was well acquainted with that kind of business, because he had previously been in the employ of a firm who did a good trade.
He was aware that he could not pay his debts last year, but he continued to trade because his returns were better each month.
The larger part of his debts were for goods supplied in the timber trade.
He attributed his insolvency to the fact that he had no capital when he commenced business, and his trade since had been insufficient to pay expenses.
The examination was eventually ordered to be adjourned.

REES, THOMAS (lately trading as Rees & Co.), contractor and merchant, late timber merchant, Merthyr Vale, and Llanbradach, and now of Glan Buildings, Cardiff, Glam.—Under this recent failure accounts have been filed showing liabilities to unsecured creditors £8,817 19s. 9s., to fully secured creditors £12,030 1s. 8d., estimated value of securities £20,150 19s., surplus of £8,120 17s. 4d. carried to contra.
To partly secured creditors £815 13s. 6d., less estimated value of securities £264, which leaves £551 13s. 6d. to rank.
Liabilities on bills £400, to preferential creditors £2 4s. 7d.

He came up for his first public examination at Windsor, and said that, although no assets were disclosed, he had had difficulty in finding his books.

The debtor claimed about £55 from the partnership.
After the dissolution he (Vicary) took over the Estate, Fulham.

WILSON, WILLIAM, timber merchant, Chelmsford.—The public examination of this debtor was fixed for Wednesday at the Shire Hall, Chelmsford, but the debtor made no proposal for composition, and an order for bankruptcy was passed.
