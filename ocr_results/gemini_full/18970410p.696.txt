INTERESTING DECISION AS TO BLOWN TIMBER.
In the end of September, 1895, William Anderson & Co., timber merchants, Glasgow, purchased from the late Sir Thomas Dawson Brodie, Bart., of Idvies and Tulloes, a large quantity of blown timber on the said estates. Under the contract Messrs. Anderson & Co. were allowed until December 31st, 1896, to saw up the timber, and until the end of September, 1897, to stack and remove it. It was also provided that if it be found impossible for Messrs. Anderson to clear the timber from the woods within that time, and if Sir Thomas was satisfied that they had made every effort that could reasonably be expected of them in doing so, he was not to enforce the pains and penalties of the contract (i.e., forfeiture of the timber not sawn) against them. Not having had sufficient time to clear the woods, various extensions of time was allowed by the deceased baronet to clear the Idvies Woods, and Sir Thomas's representatives allowed them working there long past the contract time, and also allowed them further time to get their own time to clear. Sir Thomas having died, and the time allowed under the contract having expired, the present heirs of entail presented a note of suspension and interdict to have Messrs. Anderson interdicted from entering her woods otherwise than for the purpose of removing trees or timber which had been sawn and stacked prior to the raising of the interdict. Lord Pearson, on caution being found, granted interim interdict, and passed the note for trial of the cause as to whether Messrs. Anderson were entitled to further extension of time to clear the Tulloes Woods. A question having arisen as to what was comprehended by "sawn timber," Mrs. Callendar presented a new note of suspension and interdict to have Messrs. Anderson interdicted from removing trees which had been cross-cut into lengths, and Mr. Chree, on her behalf, maintained that they had no right to remove from the woods any trees which had been merely cross-cut into lengths and had not been treated by sawing in a saw-mill, while Mr. Wm. Hunter, on behalf of Messrs. Anderson & Co., maintained that they were entitled to remove such timber as had been cross-cut into lengths and required no further sawing in order to fit it for the purpose for which it is to be used. The Lord Ordinary, after hearing counsel for the parties, refused the note, and found the complainer liable in expenses.

SAW-MILL OPERATIVES AND MACHINEMEN'S SOCIETY.—The annual soiree and concert of this Society was held on Friday evening in the Free Gardeners' Institute, Picardy Place, Edinburgh. There was a large attendance, and Councillor Mallinson, who presided, congratulated the Saw-millers' Union on the progress it had made during the last few years in Edinburgh as a branch union. He did not know of any union that gave greater benefits for the contributions. From what he knew of other unions, he was agreeably astonished that their last balance-sheet should stand out so well, notwithstanding the benefits they gave for their contributions.
