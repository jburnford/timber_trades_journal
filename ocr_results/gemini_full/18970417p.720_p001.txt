THE ELECTRICAL EXHIBITION AT NEWCASTLE.

A LIVERPOOL FIRM'S HANDIWORK.
The Electrical and Engineering General Trades and Art Exhibition which was recently opened at Newcastle by the Mayor of that city, promises to be one of the most successful exhibitions ever held in the engineering metropolis. The site of the exhibition buildings is situated in its best but an unlovely district, the eye is relieved by the fine appearance presented by the handsome structure which contains the exhibits. A large portion of land is allotted for the purposes of the exhibition, and the really attractive group of building erected thereon by Messrs. Bruce & Still, of Liverpool, is another of those triumphs of skill

for which that firm is so well known throughout the country. In passing, it may be stated that the firm obtained a gold medal in connection with the erection of handsome quarters for the Sunderland Exhibition of 1895. One might almost say that the Northumberland Road site has grown into "a thing of beauty and a joy," if not "for ever," at least during the life of the exhibition. The buildings are erected on made land, the main portion consisting of corrugated iron, and the whole structure is of a very substantial character, extremely neat in appearance, and wonderfully comfortable inside. It is the largest building of this kind, and covers about an acre and a half of ground. It absorbed upwards of 200 tons of iron, steel, timber, &c., in its construction, and it will
