CARLTON, HENRY, joiner and builder, 50, Mayfield Street, lately carrying on business in Woodcock Street, St. George's Road, Hull.—The first meeting of the creditors interested hereunder was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Hull, on Friday last. Mr. C. H. King, Deputy Official Receiver, conducted the proceedings. From the statement made to the creditors, it appears that the debtor attributes his insolvency to want of capital. In the month of January, 1881, he effected a private arrangement with his creditors. No trustee was appointed, but the matter was left in the hands of a solicitor to settle with the creditors, whose claims amounted to £450. The debtor is unable to state what composition was distributed, as he never had any statement rendered to him. In June, 1892, the debtor commenced business as a joiner with a capital of £25, which he borrowed, and he then commenced building houses in various parts of Hull. On January 25th last a meeting of his creditors was summoned by his solicitor. A statement was submitted, which showed a surplus from securities of £1,800. No proposal was made by the debtor, but it was arranged by the creditors present that the equities should be offered for sale within 10 days, failing which he was to file his petition. He was unable to obtain any offer for the equities, but a creditor offered to give 3s. in the pound to all unsecured creditors provided that the liabilities did not exceed £950. This arrangement was attempted to be carried out, but certain creditors would not accept the composition. The debtor's properties are in the hands of the mortgagees, and he is possessed of practically no assets with the exception of equities from other properties, from which he estimates a surplus of £341 15s. 3d. Having regard to the present state of the market, it appears doubtful whether such surplus exists. The debtor has kept no books of account with the exception of a debtor's and creditor's ledger. He is unable to state the amount of his household effects, whilst he has, on an average, drawn £2 per week from the parties who have been financing him, which amount he has expended for household and personal expenses. The estate was left in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.

APRIL 17, 1897.
CASTLE, ISAAC, builder, 3, Chalfont Road, lately residing at 29, Tudor Street, Leicester.—The first meeting of the creditors concerned under this failure was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Oxford, on the 8th inst. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed a deficiency of £388 1s. 1c. In reply to the Official Receiver, Mr. Ballard, who appeared for the debtor, said he was not prepared at that moment to submit an offer of composition to the creditors, but he felt disposed to advise the friends of the debtor to make an offer of 5s. in the £. The Official Receiver said he understood the debtor had built eighteen houses at Alverstone Street, Norwood Junction ; 4 houses at Alverstone Road, Tooting ; and 7 houses at Loogley Road, Tooting. He ascribed his failure to his inability to realise the houses at Alverstone Street, combined with the non-payment of outstanding book debts, and advance in the price of building material during the past six months. The Official Receiver said that the debtor had lodged a proposal for a composition of 7s. 6d. in the pound, payable forthwith upon approval by the Court. A discussion ensued, and the suggestion was made that the offer should be increased to 10s. in the pound, the additional 2s. 6d. being postponed, but guaranteed. Eventually the meeting was adjourned to May 11th for the offer to be completed and formally submitted.
HUSTLER, H. N., builder, Liverpool.—The adjourned public examination of the above-named debtor took place on Thursday last, at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Bellringer. The bankrupt stated that several years ago his mother settled a sum of £2,000 on his son, who was then a boy of eleven, with the provision that in the event of the boy's death before reaching the age of 21 then the amount in question should go to the debtor himself. That settlement had disappeared. The solicitor who drew it was dead, and the debtor stated that the advertisements he had inserted in various newspapers had been of no avail. The Official Receiver said that as the settlement could not be traced, he must ask that the examination be adjourned sine die. The Registrar said it had not been shown that the settlement had disappeared through any fault of the debtor's and he did not think that he should be punished by having the examination adjourned sine die. Eventually the debtor was allowed to pass his examination.
MEAKIN, SIDNEY, builder, 45, Pontcanna Street, Cardiff.—The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this failure took place at the offices of the Official Receiver, Cardiff, on Tuesday last. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £19,771 7s., of which £720 9s. was expected to rank against the estate for dividend ; the assets were estimated to produce £155, thus leaving a deficiency of £565 9s. The debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through "losses on rents and inability to realise property." As there was no offer of composition, it was decided to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.
SIMPSON, ALBERT EDWARD, joiner and builder, 231, St. Helens Road, Over Hulton, and Bella Street, Bolton.—The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this failure was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Bolton, on Thursday last. The summary of accounts filed by the debtor disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £480 16s. 4d., and assets estimated to produce £347 1s. 8d., thus leaving a deficiency of £409 8s. 1d. It appeared from the report and observations of the Official Receiver that the debtor commenced business on his own account in 1894, with a capital of £30, and he alleged his failure to have been caused through losses on building contracts. He first became aware of the fact that he was in a state of insolvency twelve months ago. In February last he called a private meeting of his creditors, at which he made an offer of 7s. 6d. in the £, but he was unable to carry out the arrangement. In his deficiency account he returned his household expenses since March 24th, 1896, at £100, and he returned his losses on contracts, through misconduct on the part of workmen, and other causes, at £369 8s. 1d. Eventually it was decided to leave the matter in the Official Receiver's hands, to be summarily dealt with in the usual way.
WATKINSON, JAS. FREDERICK, builder and decorator, Southport.—The public examination of this debtor took place at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Bellringer. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £881 and assets £227. The Official Receiver appeared for the general body of creditors, Mr. Threfall appeared for a creditor for money lent, and Mr. Hodge to examine the debtor. Mr. Threfall proceeded a number of topics more briefly touched by the Official Receiver, and also as to moneys borrowed from his client, Mrs. Southworth, amounting to £800. The debtor maintained that he had not been a partner, notwithstanding he had exercised the complete control of the business which he had lent moneys to the firm, he further claimed to have been a creditor of his mother's estate. These amounted to over £400. Asked where he got the money to lend, he said £200 was from a lady whose name he gave with reluctance, and the rest was made of wages which he had either not drawn, or having drawn, had partially returned. Mr. Hodge then examined the
