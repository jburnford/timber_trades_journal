Allison, Cousland & Co. The spruce deals especially have been in strong demand, having not only absorbed the import, but also largely reduced the yarded stock since the beginning of the year. The supply of 7 x 3 in. and 8 x 3 in. spruce has for a long time been inadequate for the demand, and high prices are obtainable. In connection with the steamer line referred to there will be only two further arrivals, \"Alcides\" (s), bringing consignments to a considerable amount, and this service then ends for the season, the steamers being put on to the St. Lawrence trade. The first sailing from Clyde for the St. Lawrence took place this week.\n\nRobert Hamilton & Co.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n75, ST.

Prices generally continue steady, there being no change to note since last week. The shipbuilding demand is reported quieter meantime, but on the whole a good state of trade is experienced, and saw-mills are kept actively employed. Quebec waney board wood of prime quality has been in good demand, but the supply of this description is limited, stock consisting largely of second-class timber. Kauri pine has improved in demand and brings good prices. A public sale of timber is to be held at Greenock on Thursday next, 22nd inst., the catalogue for which is to a considerable extent comprised of unreserved lots.\nParticulars of the business done at Messrs. Allison, Cousland & Co.'s sale of deals at Yorkhill, Glasgow, on the 14th inst. will be given next week.\n\nLEITH.\nThe arrivals are more numerous this week, but none of outstanding importance. They consist of 9,216 deals and battens and 134 pitprops per \"Denmark,\" from Porsgrund; 59 1/2 fathoms firewood, per \"Roakva,\" from Fredrikstadt; 4,569 deals and battens and eight fathoms firewood, per \"Heimdal,\" from Skien; 401 red logs and ends, per \"Die Geschwester,\" from Windau; 9,279 battens, per \"Dagmar,\" from Porsgrund; 80 1/2 fathoms firewood, per \"Vesta,\" from Drammen; 55 1/2 fathoms firewood, per \"Oscar,\" from Drammen; 1,472 pcs. pine, per \"Glanton\" (s), from New York; 954\n\nJAMES KENNEDY & CO.,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchants,\n69, BUCHANAN STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"LIGNUM, GLASGOW.\"\n\nLOVE & STEWART,\nPitwood Importers & Coal Exporters,\n140, HOPE STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"LOVART.\" Telephone No. 3051.\n\nLOVE & FIFE,\nENGINEERS,\nWOOD-WORKING MACHINERY\nof every Description.\nBEITH.\n\nM.

There was only a moderate attendance of buyers and the quantity of goods disposed of was correspondingly restricted. Canary white-wood 1-inch boards fetched 2 1/4d. per sup. foot, whilst Canary logs were sold at 19 1/2d. to 20d. per cubic foot.
