Calder & Co.'s timber yard at Granton. It is believed to have been caused by sparks from a passing engine. At the time of the outbreak workmen were loading railway sleepers into two waggons from the creosoting tank. The flames, which were first observed near the floor of the engine-house, spread with great rapidity, catching hold of the contents of the large iron tank, which was filled with railway sleepers, the creosoting of which had been completed, and were being carried away. Those on the fire and were soon ablaze. An engine was near, to which waggons were attached, and at once drawn out of the yard.\nThe local fire brigade was speedily on the scene, and a copious supply of water being available, the flames were soon got under, but not before considerable damage was done, variously estimated at from £500 to £1,000, which, it is stated, is covered by insurance.\nROBERT KERR & SONS,\nESTABLISHED 1859.\nGLENGARNOCK near BEITH, N.B.\nGENERAL ENGINEERS,\nMakers of Wood-working Machinery\nOF EVERY DESCRIPTION\nFor Saw-mills, Joiners, Cabinet Makers and Chair Manufacturers, &c.\nMAKERS OF\nJohn Pollock's Patent Automatic Wood Carving Machines.\nTelegrams: \"Pitwood.\"\nTelephone No. 176\nBRYSON & COY.,\nPitwood Importers & Timber Merchants,\n62, BUCHANAN STREET,\nGLASGOW.",
