FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
CARLTON, HENRY, joiner and builder, 59, Mayfield Street, Hull.—This debtor came up for his public examination at the last sitting of the Hull Bankruptcy Court, in answer to the deputy Official Receiver, the debtor said he commenced business in 1878 with a capital of £50. He discontinued business in 1881, and made a private arrangement with his creditors. He left Hull and never received any account of the private arrangement from his solicitor. In 1892 he recommenced business with a capital of £25, borrowed money. He called the creditors together again a few months ago, but was unable to effect another private arrangement. His liabilities now were £7,816 3s. 4d. His estimated value of securities was £8,140, leaving a surplus of £1,278; £316 8s. 6d was expected to rank for dividend, leaving a surplus over and above liabilities of £341 15s. 3d. He thought it possible for the surplus to be realised in the present state of the market.—The Official Receiver: If you thought it possible to realise you would never have come into court. Debtor: Well, I had no chance. The mortgagees are in possession! Yes. Is not the property mortgaged up to the hilt?—Well, yes. Is it not the state of the property market in Hull bad at the present time?—No; I don't think so.—When did you become aware of your insolvency?—I don't know that I am insolvent now.—But these Eldorados of properties are in the hands of mortgagees?—Yes. Continuing, debtor said he had been allowed £2 per week.—The examination was eventually ordered to be closed.
CHISLETT & LEWIS, yacht builders, of London.
Mr. Alpar, solicitor of Lambourn, Hamworthy.—Mr. Alpar, solicitor of Lambourn, Hamworthy, made an application before his Honour Judge Philbrick at the last sitting of the bank ruptcy County Court for the annulment of this bankruptcy so far as the debtor Lewis was concerned. His Honour was well acquainted with the facts of the case, and no doubt knew that the creditors of the partnership estate and the creditors of the separate estate of Lewis had been paid in full. The Registrar said the application was not opposed by the Official

Receiver, whereupon his Honour said he wished all bankruptcies had a termination like that, and he should make the order forthwith.
HOW, WILLIAM, timber dealer, Upper Luton Road, Chatham.—This was a sitting for the public examination of the debtor.—The examination was held at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court on the 15th inst. It happened that the goods on the debtor's own premises were being in possession of the debtor under two executions from the County Court, by the debtor the stock was valued at £770 to £779 10s. 3d. of which he had remitted to secured creditors the sum of £541 1s. 5d. He commenced business at Upper Luton Road about thirty years ago as a timber dealer with a small capital. Subsequently he took some land, part of which he still occupies, and during the last six months he had been pressed by creditors. He has not kept rough books of account, and he has been known of his insolvency for some time past, but was then questioned at considerable length by Mr. F. A. Stigant, who appeared for the creditors, in the course of which the debtor became very excited, and alleged that Mr. Stigant was trying to baffle him, because he was no scholar. Eventually the debtor was allowed to pass his examination.
WILSON, WILLIAM, timber merchant, Shrewsbury.—At Shrewsbury Bankruptcy Court, before his Honour Judge Harris, an application was made an application for the approval of the Court to a composition that had been offered by the above-named debtor to his creditors. His Honour said he had read the Official Receiver's report very carefully, and it seemed to him to be very favourable to the application being granted. The Official Receiver said the creditors would receive more under the proposed scheme than they would otherwise obtain. His Honour eventually made the order asked for.
