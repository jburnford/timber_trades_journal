THE PITCH PINE MYSTERY.
The following extract from the Galveston Daily News will afford some amusement to our readers, if its perusal has no other result. It is peculiar that our esteemed contemporary displays such ignorance of the competing influences of the various woods in our markets, but this might be overlooked if the writer's opinions were more modest, and given on conclusions which nobody of experience at all acquainted with the timber trade can confirm. Teak and pitch pine are as dissimilar as chalk from cheese, and to compare the latter into rivalry with oak is equally absurd. The article will, nevertheless, be worth a perusal as a Galveston view of the European wood market, and with more emphasis than the writer had given it, of the timber in its wasteful slaughter of the timber in its vicinity, and the impossibility of replacing it when its intrinsic value is better understood. If all handlers of pitch pine on this side would have fully appreciated his efforts to regulate the supply, and raise the market from its present unstable and unsatisfactory condition. The method of shipping valuable timber at little above the freight charge has always been a mystery to importers on this side, and we suppose will always continue so to the end :—
Canadian manufacturers enlarge upon the idea that they will find consumers in Europe for all of their surplus that has heretofore been taken by the United States, in the event of the dollar clause on manufactured lumber in the tariff bill becoming a law, and thereby place that much that would go to Europe from the United States. This will intimidate the exporter of pitch pine who is familiar with the class of wood goods that this country has been taking from Canada. With limited exceptions the best of their cut has for years gone across the ocean, and the second and third grades sold to the Americans. Where pitch pine is needed the Canadian can not place it outside and knotty stuff on account of cost of transportation, and no one understands this better than the gentleman who advances this theory. They are attempting to burn wet powder, for it has always been a ruling disposition in England to trade with her colonies on a principle commended by friend and enemy alike. The woods that pitch pine has totally displaced about the great ship ya[rds]
