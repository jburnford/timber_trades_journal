position to in effect double the accommodation available at the docks.
Mr. J. McKergow (the President of the Board of Trade, Montreal), who was very cordially received, said he was asked to present to them the kind wishes of the Montreal Board of Trade, and their desire that the trade between Bristol and Canada might largely increase. Canada was to a large extent an agricultural country, dependent upon the mother country for an out-let for her productions. He was glad to learn that the accommodation at Avon-mouth was to be improved, and he hoped that the railways would follow suit by providing refrigerator cars. In Canada they rejoiced at the movement towards Imperial Federation. (Applause.) Commemorating that happy result, the Imperial Delivery Company was now in a position to offer to his friend them to do so in the future. By their system of barging from the ship's side to the Midland Railway Company had given the merchants of the port the advantages of a competitive system.
Mr. George H. Perrin (ex-president) rose to propose "The Mayor, High Sheriff, and Corporation of Bristol." He said he first annual assessment was reported to the Council in January, 1837—it was £383,315; 60 years after, in 1897, it was £1,378,268. (Applause). The work of governing the great commercial corporate undertakings of Bristol had become stupendous, and in his judgment was being led to the conclusion that too much was being done under municipal control. He shared with many citizens the opinion that the docks could be better managed by a dock trust or commission.
