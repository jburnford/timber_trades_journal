FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

PICTON, WILLIAM, builder, 75, Pembroke Road, Cardiff, and trading at Palmerston Street, Cadoxton. — The first meeting of the creditors interested under this failure was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Cardiff, on Monday last, under the presidency of the Official Receiver. The statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt disclosed liabilities amounting to £694 13s. 7d., and assets estimated to produce £2,199 3s. 10d. The debtor alleged his present position to have been caused from loss by fire in June, 1895, and bad debts. Eventually it was decided to leave the matter in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration in the usual manner.

REES, THOMAS, contractor, of Merthyr, Llanbradach, and Cardiff.—This debtor came up for his adjourned public examination at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court on Friday last, before the deputy registrar. The statement of affairs showed a surplus of £1,657 3s. 11d. The failure was attributed to want of capital. In answer to questions the debtor said he was confident that he could pay 20s. in the pound, but they were not liquid assets, and at present he could not meet the demand. He started at Merthyr without capital. In 1893, however, he was worth £7,000 or £8,000, but during the last eighteen months he had sustained heavy losses on contracts. He had been a director of several companies, but had not received large fees, none at all from some of the companies. Mr. Sankey, barrister, who appeared for the trustee, examined the debtor at some length with regard to his investments in the Navigation Hotel, the Mount Pleasant Estate, and in respect of certain houses at Merthyr. The examination was eventually ordered to be adjourned to the next Court, the debtor being asked to make an amended deficiency account.
