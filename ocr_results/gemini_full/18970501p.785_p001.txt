TRADE REPORTS.

GLASGOW.
There is little to note in the way of change as regards the general demand for wood goods.
An active rate of consumption is maintained, and recent deliveries have made a large reduction in stocks of timber and deals.
The depletion is of course most apparent on such descriptions as are not imported, or very sparingly so, in the early part of the year; while as regards the imports received since the beginning of the year, these have been largely on contract, and have also to a considerable extent been delivered to buyers ex quay.
A great part of the imports during the early months is composed of shipments from the States, consignments alone amounting to about 7,000 loads for current year, consisting mostly of waggon scantlings on contract and for immediate delivery to consumers.
The other imports have comprised a few cargoes pitch pine, deals from St. John, N.B., which have met with an active demand and realised excellent prices.
The Clyde import for the year have further included a few cargoes Kauri pine, teak, greenheart, and the one cargo (Honduras wood), the mahogany direct import has been represented by only one cargo, which was all cleared at auction shortly after discharge.
There have also been occasional consignments of mahogany sawn square arriving here per steamers, but these have been disposed of as a rule ex quay,

and at present there is none in first hand.
Mahogany is much wanted, inquiries being frequent, and imports would command high prices.
The import of pitch pine to Clyde since the beginning of the year has been four cargoes, which have contained about 550 loads hewn logs, 5,400 loads sawn logs, and 192 loads planks; as the rate of consumption has been more than double this quantity the stock has undergone considerable depletion, but continued moderation in imports is still necessary to produce a favourable effect on prices.
Teak planks have been moderately imported, and among arrivals have met good demand.
In the list of the past week there were various consignments of teak logs and planks per "Arracan," from Rangoon, there were also consignments of Austrian oak logs and planks per "Matas Kiraly" (s), which are in course of delivery to consumers.
The "Concordia" (s), from St. John, N.B., has landed at Yorkhill spruce deals and birch planks for Allison, Coulsland & Co.; and the other arrivals for the week are parcels per liners from Baltimore, etc., which amount to about 500 loads hewn and 1,500 loads sawn.

Garland & Roger held a public sale on Tuesday, 27th ult., at their Railway Yard, Edinburgh Dock.
The weather conditions were rather unfavourable, but notwithstanding this there was a fairly large attendance, and although no large lines of any particular descriptions of goods were placed, there was a good overturn on the total owing to the extensive variety of wood goods offered.
Prices ruled very much the same as at recent auctions, and therefore call for no special remark.
