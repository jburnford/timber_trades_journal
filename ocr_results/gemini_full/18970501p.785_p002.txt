THE COST OF THE EXTENSION OF EDINBURGH.
One of the very first results of the enlargement of the area of Edinburgh has been a considerable increase in the municipal estimates for the coming year.
The Scotsman says that the submission by the Treasurer's Committee this week of the draft provisional valuation gave rise to a discussion of considerable interest to the ratepayer.
According to these, the administration of the city will during the coming year cost some £21,500 more than during the current year.
If we take it that a penny on the rates produces about £9,000, then it is plain that the increase, were it not mitigated by additional revenue, would involve a rise of about 2½d. in the pound.
This would be a pretty stiff price to pay to the first year's account for amalgamation.
The increase is practically confined to two departments, those of Cleaning and Lighting and of Streets and Buildings.
On the former account the increase is £9,500; on the latter it is £13,250.
Treasurer M'Crae appealed to both committees to reconsider their estimates, with a view to cutting them down at any available point.
He was met on behalf of both committees by the simple rejoinder that every penny was required; nay, the convener of the Streets and Buildings Committee even hinted that the estimate would prove to be too low rather than too high.
It is easy to sympathise with Treasurer M'Crae's zeal for retrenchment.
But it must be admitted

MAY 1, 1897.
that his statement upon the various items of expenditure, though in itself clear, did not present a convincing, nor indeed a plausible, case against the estimates of the two committees which are chiefly responsible for the increase.
He put his finger upon no one item and say, Here is extravagance; here is an opportunity for economy.
His statement was rather a general lamentation over the growth of the Municipal Budget and the steady rise of the people, and an appeal to the taxpayer to demand from the representatives tives things which would be looked for in private enterprise, and which are not on the table.
In the case of the extension of the city, that the extension of the city boundaries must be held to be largely responsible for the increased expenditure of the coming year.
There are two new streets to light, to clean, and to maintain on the south side; and by the amalgamation agreement which formerly lay out of the city boundaries Edinburgh is bound, for some years at least, to keep up the rates in the added districts at the level at which they stood at the time of amalgamation, so that any increase in the expenditure caused by the determination to place such a place as Portobello on an equality, as regards light-ing and cleaning, with Edinburgh, falls upon the rates of the city proper.
Treasurer M'Crae would doubtless be the first to admit this; so that the real question before the Council was not whether the estimates should show an increase at all, but whether the increase was not extravagant.
Where the Treasurer failed to establish a case for looseness was in not showing convincingly under what item or items the estimates might be lowered without at the same time lowering the efficiency of the service.
He condescended to particulars in the case of the destructor, and condemned the system of carting the refuse to the outskirts of the city as extravagant.
There are serious sanitary objections to the dumping down of heaps of refuse in suburban parishes; but Mr. Menzies, on behalf of the Cleaning and Lighting Committee, was able to show that in point of cost the destructor, so far as it has worked, has proved a good investment.
Possible it has not had a fair trial; but Mr. Menzies showed that the destruction of refuse had cost three times as much per ton as its removal to a distance of twelve miles from the city.
On the other hand, Treasurer M'Crae seemed to be upon safer ground in calling attention to the slovenly manner in which streets are relaid after they have been broken up for the introduction of pipes and conduits.
A second opinion is very frequently required; and it does seem that the attention of the committee might with advantage be devoted to the sparing of double work in causeways and pavements.

END OF THE DISPUTE IN THE VICTORIA CABINET WORKS, KIRKCALDY.
The dispute that has been pending for the past four weeks at the Victoria Cabinet Works, Kirkcaldy, between the Allied cabinetmakers and the non-union section, has now virtually terminated.
Ever since the strike began there have been secessions from the ranks of the strikers, and many of those who left the town for other parts of Scotland have now returned, while others have found employment under the firm for re-engagement.
A number of the men who have re-addressed to the firm, which stated that they could no longer work alongside men outside their union.
The members of the Alliance Society, which embraces the polishers, &c., have also returned to work—at least, a great many of those who came out on strike.
