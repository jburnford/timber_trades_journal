ENGLISH TIMBER SALE.
The annual sale of timber on the Shardeloes Estate, which took place recently at Amersham was not attended by such a large company as usual, an undercurrent of feeling generally prevailing that foreign imported chair material coming in large quantities had struck a serious blow at the beech timber trade. The timber is always put on to the market in good form by Messrs. W. Brown and Co., of Tring, and the sale resulted in 23,714 feet yielding 1s. 4 1/2d. per foot. The timber went chiefly to Berkhampstead and Chesham, and a small proportion to Wycombe, the remainder locally. Messrs. W. Brown & Co., of Tring and Chesham, were the auctioneers.
