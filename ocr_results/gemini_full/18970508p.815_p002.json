The statement of affairs showed liabilities (gross) £3,959 18s. 1d., of which £2,881 1s. 1d. was expected to rank, and assets estimated to produce £1,025 4s. 5d. Alleged causes of failure were want of capital and bad debts on contracts. The debtors were examined by Mr. H. E. Hooper, the Official Receiver, and in answer to him the debtor, Walter Barton, said he was in partnership with his brother, Frank Charles Barton. The business commenced about 14 years ago, and was begun in Christchurch Road, where they had a lease of a workshop at £26. At the present time they had premises at 159, High Street, and 149, which they held on lease, and 160 and 161 were also in their occupation, and they also rented certain other premises. The capital in the business was £150, which they had gone on dividing the profits, but they had never made out a balance-sheet, or gone into their affairs to see how they stood, nor had they had any stocktaking. \"Then, from the time you commenced business,\" the debtor was asked, \"you have had no means of knowing what your profits were, or whether you have made any?\"--\"We really have not known.\" Answering further questions, the witness said that no cash book had been sent in regularly. His brother had been aware, nor was his brother's wife aware. Not having kept an account of receipts and expenditure they were not in a position to make up a deficiency account, nor could they make up a trading account for the past six years. With regard to his separate estate, all that belonged to him was the furniture in the house, which he valued at £25. Some of the furniture was claimed by his wife, to whom some articles were given by her mother at the time of her marriage, twenty-two years ago, and others had been purchased since, with her money. Eventually the examination was adjourned.\nBAYNES, FREDERICK\n(trading as J. Baynes & Son), timber merchant, 15, Micklegate, York.--The gross liabilities amount to £1,025 4s. 5d., and are as follows:--To unsecured creditors £444 4s. 5d.; to partly secured creditors £481, less estimated value of security £100, which leaves £381 to rank--total unsecured liabilities £825 4s. 5d.; and assets, consisting of cash in hand £10; cash deposited with solicitor for costs of petition £8 1s. 10d., stock-in-trade (cost) £1,800; trade fixtures, fittings, machinery, &c., £300; book debts good £201 11s. 11d., estimated to produce £150; bills of exchange £10 10s. 10d., less £4 5s. 1d. for preferential claims, which leaves £2,205 7s. 9d., or a surplus of £1,285 12s. 5d. Official Receiver's observations:--Since the filing of the debtor's petition, on the 21st inst., he has been examined in relation to his affairs and dealings, the causes of his failure, and the following facts have been elicited:--The business was established by the debtor's grandfather, and was formerly conducted by the debtor's father, who did a prosperous business. In January 1894, the father transferred the business to the debtor, and gave him the stock and machinery, free from all liabilities, valued at £2,100. Debtor had no capital of his own, but obtained £360 from his mother, the whole of which he conveyed to his wife, and the household furniture conveyed to her at the same time been engaged to her. He had acted as manager for his father who had carried on the business. With reference to the \"security\" on the debtor's life is a policy of insurance for £250, which was effected about twenty years ago; the premium is £4 10s. per annum. In the Official Receiver's opinion the stock and machinery--also the book debts--valued at £2,000 will not produce that amount, but the machinery and stock have been well kept up.\nIRISH NATIVE TIMBER.\nThe arrivals of Irish Native Timber at Queenstown Dock mostly have been as follows:--\nApril 21 Dalphie-100 tons-Wilson Bros.\n22 Spencer-70 tons-J.
