SHIPWRIGHTS' WAGES QUESTION.
AN adjourned meeting of the Aberdeen shipwrights and joiners was held on Wednesday night to consider the wages question. The employers have offered a rise of a shilling a week now and another shilling three months hence. This is not, however, meeting with the approval of the men, and a lengthy discussion is taking place over it. The meeting was eventually adjourned.

ABERDEEN QUARRIERS' WAGES.
A meeting of the quarrymen in the employ of the Rubislaw Quarrying Company was held in the Trade Hall on Tuesday to consider as to the movement for an advance of wages. A request to this effect was sent to the company a fortnight ago, and a fortnight was allowed for its consideration. The period expired on Saturday. It was reported at the meeting on Tuesday night that no reply had been received. The men agreed to give another week to the company to reply, and to meet again next Tuesday to consider as to what further steps should be taken.
