American canary whitewood logs and yellow pine deals, as well as a good assortment of Baltic deals and battens.

Mr. John W. Woyka, of the firm of W. WOYKA & CO., who has had a long and thorough knowledge of the mahogany trade, particularly in the mahogany and hardwood branches, has opened an office at Central Chambers, 12, Waterloo Street, on business there under the style of John W. Woyka & Co.
The special trade to be cultivated will be the importing of the various descriptions of American lumber, also African mahogany, &c., and periodical auction sales are to be held, at which times goods will be exposed in suitable lots.
A regular and convenient medium of supply will thus be provided, which we anticipate will be appreciated by many buyers in Glasgow and from a distance.
As this is a convenient centre, the auction sales are intended to be held bi-monthly at Queen's Dock or Yorkhill.
Mr. Woyka is well qualified for this special line, and from his popularity and the energy of character we expect to see his enterprise attended with a large measure of success.

NEW AGENCY.—Chr. Salvesen & Co., of Leith, has been appointed agent in Scotland for the firm of L. Leuzinger & Vogel, of Riga, who ship under the mark L & V.

SAW-MILL ACCIDENT.—An accident of a frightful nature occurred last week at the Lochgelly Iron and Coal Company's Colliery at Little Raith.
Robert M'Aughey, a saw-miller, 22 years of age, son of James M'Aughey, of Broad Street, Cowdenbeath, was working at a saw-mill, when he fell in front of a circular saw which was in motion, and his head was completely severed from his body.
