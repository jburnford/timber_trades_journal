FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BYRNE, FREDK., trading as Fredk. Byrne & Co., saw-mill proprietor and cabinet manufacturer, 1, Orchard Street, Wandsworth.
—This bankrupt attended at the Wandsworth Bankruptcy Court last week, before Mr. Registrar Willoughby, for adjourned public examination, having been ordered to file further accounts.
Mr. G. H. Acheson, Assistant Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, and Mr. Smith (Ward, Parks, & McKay) the trustee, Mr. Davies.
Mr. Smith explained that the bankrupt had furnished the trustee with the accounts as he required, and there was no objection to the bankrupt being allowed to pass his public examination, but the accounts had not been placed upon the file of the Court, owing to the necessary stamps not being attached thereto.
He thought the accounts ought to be properly filed.
Mr. Acheson said the order of the Court was that the accounts should be filed, and it would seriously affect the bankrupt's position if he applied for his discharge if the accounts did not appear upon the file in accordance with the terms of the order.
The Registrar said they must be filed.
Bankrupt undertook this should be done, and having made the statutory declaration of full disclosure was allowed to pass his public examination.

J. H. ROWNTREE, 30, Great St. Helens, LONDON, E.C.
TELEGRAMS—"GRACENOTE, LONDON."

CROSS, GEORGE, builders' merchant, 185, King's Road, Chelsea, S.W.—This case came before Mr. Registrar Giffard on Tuesday, and upon the application of Messrs. Martyn & Martyn a receiving order was made under a creditor's petition.
The liabilities were returned at under £3,000, and the assets were stated to consist of stock &c., estimated to realise £200 and certain equities of redemption.

FAIREY and HUMPHREY, timber merchants, 55 and 56, Bishopsgate Street Within, E.C.—A sitting for public examination was held in this case last week before Mr. Registrar Hope.
The accounts showed gross liabilities £8,632 10s. 3d., of which £6,875 14s. 10d., were expected to rank, and the assets at £7,811 10s 8d.
The matter is being wound up, Mr. H. W. Bayne, timber merchant, 101, Leadenhall Street, acting as trustee.
It appeared that the business was formerly carried on at 1, St. Helen's Place, E.C., but in September, 1894, was removed to 55 and 56, Bishopsgate Street.
The failure was ascribed to entirely to heavy bad debts incurred prior to March 31st, 1895, mainly through excessive advances having been made to Canadian and American shippers.
In September, 1896, a meeting of creditors was held and a deed of arrangement was executed, but was not acted upon, as all the creditors did not concur in it, and Fairey then withdrew from the firm.
Mr. G. W. Chapman attended as Assistant Receiver.
Mr. Street for the trustee, and Mr. Lindsay Smith on behalf of the bankrupt Humphrey.
The debtors were examined at some length.
Mr. Humphrey in the course of his evidence stating that he had paid no less than £7,000 into the business, and eventually the examination was concluded.

PICTON, WILLIAM THOMAS, builder, Cardiff.—This debtor was publicly examined at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court last week before Mr. Registrar Langley.
The debtor, in answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, said he have built houses in Cardiff and elsewhere, which he afterwards mortgaged.
If they could be sold for their full value, there would be a surplus of about £1,500 over and above the amount advanced on them.
He commenced business as a builder in 1886, and has traded at Sengenydd, Cadoxton, and Cardiff.
Finally the examination was ordered to be closed.

WHITE, CHARLES, builder, White House, Freezywater, Enfield Highway, lately carrying on business at Middlesex House, Totteridge Road, Enfield Highway.
The Official Receiver for the Edmonton district has now issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the debtor has filed a statement of affairs showing gross liabilities amounting to £1,917 12s. 4d., of which £1,795 3s. 8d. is due to unsecured creditors, and the total liabilities expected to rank against the estate for dividend are returned at £1,895 3s. 8d.
The assets are estimated to produce £140 17s. 7d., from which £22 8s. 8d. has to be deducted for the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaving nett assets at £118 8s. 11d., and disclosing a deficiency of £1,776 14s. 9d.
It appears that the debtor has been adjudicated bankrupt.
About thirteen years ago he commenced to trade as a builder in Totteridge Road, Enfield Highway, without any capital of his own, and he continued to carry on that business until about a fortnight prior to the date of the receiving order.
In August last he contracted to build ten houses at Cheshunt for £1,600, but that contract has not been completed, and the debtor has filed an account showing that he has received £1,390 on account of that contract.
The books of account kept by the debtor are a day-book and ledger showing accounts with debtors only.
He has not kept a cash-book, nor any account of his household expenses, which he estimates at about 50s. per week.
A private meeting of the creditors was held on April 14th last at Masons' Hall Tavern, at which a statement of affairs was presented showing assets, excluding book debts, estimated at £150.
The book debts are now estimated at £10 17s. 7d.

The debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through losses on contracts within the last three years and bad debts.
He states that he became aware that he had not sufficient money to pay his debts in full about three years ago, and that since that time he has contracted debts, the only expectation he had of being able to pay them being increased business.
