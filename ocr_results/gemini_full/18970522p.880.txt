BUILDING TRADE BRISK IN ST. ANDREWS. —The building trade is particularly brisk at present in St. Andrews, property to the value of £30,000 being now in course of erection, while the Commissioners have just passed plans for the erection of new houses, &c., to the value of £20,000.

THE LUMBERERS' LITTLE JOKE.—When the Prince of Wales visited Canada thirty-seven years ago, he was taken up the Ottawa River, and at the Chats an address was presented on behalf of the 20,000 lumberers and raftsmen of the Ottawa Valley. It concluded with the words: "Long may you remain the Prince of Wales." And this was no slip of the pen. "When we put in the address 'Long may you remain the Prince of Wales,' we meant it," said the chief lumberman. "We were perfectly satisfied with the Queen, and wanted her to remain on the throne as long as she could." The other day, in view of the Queen's Jubilee, this chief lumberman, Mr. Alan Mason, wrote to the Prince reminding him of the incident, and received this reply:—His Royal Highness perfectly remembers the incident to which you refer. His Royal Highness greatly appreciates and thanks you for your kind and loyal sentiments, and he will not fail to make them known to the Queen."

GREENOCK.
Two large steamers have arrived here this week with full cargoes of pitch pine timber, and are discharging at James Watt Dock. The "Knutsford" (s) (1,353), from Pa., brings 1,193 logs sawn timber and deals for stowage for Mr. John M'Crea of Glasgow; and 1,369 logs sawn and off sawn consigned to Singleton, Dunn, & Co. The "Gledhow" (s) (1,737), from Pensacola, brings 3,860 logs sawn and 510 deals on account of Cant & Kemp, Glasgow. As before noted, M'Dowall & Neilson will hold a public auction at the Esplanade on the 27th current.

FIRE IN A CLYDE SHIPYARD.
A serious outbreak of fire occurred on Monday afternoon amongst some loose wood on the first-class cruiser "Argonaut," now building at Fairfield Shipbuilding Yard. Owing to the strong wind prevailing at the time, the flames speedily obtained a firm hold of the pitch-covered teak planking with which the iron frame of the ship is sheathed. The heat of the sun had melted the pitch, and thus rendered the woodwork an easier prey to the flames, which on the arrival of the fire-engine had spread over the sides of the cruiser. After an hour's work the brigade succeeded in checking the progress of the fire. The sheathing for about a quarter of the length of the vessel on both sides will have to be renewed, and, though the flames never penetrated to the inside, it is stated many of the plates constituting the frame have been damaged by the great heat. "Argonaut's" keel, a few yards aft of the ram, and is supposed to have been caused by a red-hot rivet falling among some shavings or other combustible material. The blocks on which the cruiser rested did not appear to be much damaged, and there is no danger of her falling out of the launching cradle.

OBITUARY.
We regret to announce the death of John Yellowlees, Mill Dam, Peebles, who died on the 16th inst., in his 75th year. The funeral took place on Wednesday.

Mr. GEORGE CADELL STEWART (of the firm of Love & Stewart), Provost of Bo'ness, Chairman of the Harbour Commissioners, and member of the School Board, was the first witness called on Tuesday to give evidence before the Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to consider the Bo'ness Town and Harbour Bill.

ABERDEEN SLATERS' STRIKE.—The strikers met in the Trades Hall on Saturday morning, and had a prolonged discussion on the situation. The secretary read communications from two of the men, intimating that they intended resuming work, and as they were not present at the meeting, it was presumed that they had done so. In view of those defections, the secretary was instructed to communicate with the Building Trades Federation, which will, in turn, take action by withdrawing other union trade men employed alongside the offenders.
