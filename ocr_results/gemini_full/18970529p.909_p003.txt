FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
CAPPS, E., builder, Felixstowe, Ipswich.—The above-named debtor came up for his public examination at the Ipswich Bankruptcy Court on Friday. The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £1,271, including £671 to 22 unsecured creditors, and £600 to one creditor partially secured. The assets comprised stock-in-trade £10, and surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured £255. Deducting £4 19s. for preferential claims, the net deficiency was £1,010 19s. The debtor stated, in answer to questions, that he commenced business many years ago with a capital of £100. His work had been of a speculative character, and had been carried on principally at Chiswick and Felixstowe. As he built upon the sites in both places, money to the amount of over £4,000 was advanced to him on mortgage. If the Chiswick houses were forced into the market, however, he did not think they would fetch enough to pay off the charges upon them, and the value of the property at Felixstowe had depreciated because there had been no development of that portion of the place lying between the station and the town. If his anticipations in this respect had been realised, his speculations might have turned out well. In reply to Mr. Leighton, who appeared for two creditors, debtor said he had talked about a syndicate by which he was supported, but he was not connected with any syndicate for building a hotel. He was to have been the builder if the project had been realised. He had an interest in the tile he had patented, but, for want of means to work it, he thought it would not be worth anything. Eventually the examination was ordered to be adjourned.
DOUBELL, H G., builder, Landor Road, Stockwell, S.W.—The debtor traded as H. G. Doubell & Co., and the first meeting of his creditors was held last week before Mr. Hough, Official Receiver. The debtor commenced business in April, 1891, with £80 capital, having

911
purchased it from his father for £300, the value of the stock, paying £80 down and the balance in instalments. In the beginning of March he executed a deed of assignment, and a fortnight later the trustee thereunder convened a meeting of creditors. The debtor then undertook, with the assistance of a composition of 10s. in the pound, but subsequently his father declined to become surety and the arrangement fell through. The business has since been continued under the supervision of the trustee. The debtor attributed his insolvency to bad trade during the past two years, loss on the general depreciation in the value of the stock, and to now estimated for realisation. The statutory accounts have not as yet been filed, but the debtor estimated his unsecured debts at about £1,200 and his assets at £445. The debtor made no proposal, and Mr. J. W. Davis, accountant, 15, Coleman Street, E.C., was appointed trustee of the estate. A committee of inspection was also nominated, consisting of Mr. Harry Cockshut, and the representatives of Messrs. Nicholson & Co. (Limited), Young & Co., and Messrs. Farmiloe & Sons. The public examination is fixed for June 3rd, at noon.
HARES, GEORGE, builder, Shelsley Kings, Worcester.—The above-named debtor was publicly examined at the last sitting of the Worcester Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar. Replying to questions put by the Official Receiver, he stated that he commenced business on some property which he raised some money on some he had been struggling on for twenty-five year he had paid more or less summonses. His present partly caused through the owing to a collision, and in there was an action pending money of a Mr. Millichap, and to pay a pressing debt. The in following up his wife and she having run away. The examination was closed.
PEACOCK, JOHN P. (trading as David Peacock), builder, Lower Moseley Yard, Lower Moseley Street, Manchester.—The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this failure was held last week at the offices of the Official Receiver, Manchester, when a statement of affairs was submitted showing liabilities amounting to £2,031, and assets estimated to produce £480, after deducting the claims of preferential creditors, leaving a deficiency of £1,571. He attributed his failure to have been caused through bad trade, a rise in the price of timber, and the state of the labour market. After considerable discussion, it was decided to adjudicate debtor a bankrupt, and Mr. J. H. Scott, manager of the Timber Trades Association, Hull and Liverpool, was appointed trustee, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection, which was also appointed.
WIGG, SAMUEL LEGGETT, joiner, Wilby, Suffolk.—The public examination of this debtor took place at the Ipswich Bankruptcy Court, on Friday. The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £134 17s 8d., and assets estimated to produce £67 14s 2d. The assets consisted entirely of stock-in-trade and book debts, the furniture belongs to his wife, having been bought for her by her father prior to her marriage in 1882. The examination was eventually ordered to be closed.
