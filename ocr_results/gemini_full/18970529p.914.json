Both shipments seem to be of excellent quality, and a satisfactory beginning of the season's deliveries. Trade is moving more briskly, and the prospects of building are very encouraging.\nWe note with regret that the grave closed last week over Mr. Arthur H. Hutchison, Swedish and Norwegian Vice-Consul here, and long connected with the timber trade, originally as a partner in the old-established firm of Hutchison Brothers, and latterly carrying on business under the style of A. H. Hutchison & Co., timber agents.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nMay 20 Mette—Wanevik—12 lds. firewood—J. and A. Davidson.\n21 Telephone—Abo—1,630 lds. deals, deals and boards—J.

The new Royal train, which will convey the Queen from Paddington for her stay at Windsor Palace on the occasion of the commemoration, has been completed, and is now undergoing its final lifting and road tests. The train is, of course, the Queen's special, and this is the more interesting as Her Majesty's original one was built at so early date upon the broad gauge that on narrow gauge carriages were, as a rule, very short. The carriages were, as a matter of fact, for use upon the Great Western line as also upon the South Western between Bishop's Road and Windsor Street when that company worked the rolling stock over it. The change from broad to narrow gauge necessitated much activity in 1892, and the carriages were then transformed. The old carriages were only 38 feet long, but this year they have been lengthened, and at a cost of twenty-two thousand pounds, the prize train at the Chicago Exhibition of 1893 attained to a cost of £25,000. The Queen has a new vehicle altogether, which has made most satisfactory trials, and which has been lent for service on the South Western and other lines. The new coach, the Company's engineers have enlarged, and re-decorated, and this has been done with so much taste that it absolutely the appears a new vehicle, and have the old portions of the interior made to agree. The coach is now forty-three feet in length, and has been increased to fifty-six feet, the saloon occupying the centre of the coach. The entire carriage has been built on a new very strong steel under-frame, with finely-carved panels of teak. The chocolate-brown, highly-polished mahogany panels on the upper portion, with mahogany beading round the plate-glass windows. The exterior of the carriage is with the Royal arms and Royal monograms finely-executed painting, the general appearance being enhanced by gilding. The interior of the Queen's saloon is beautifully panelled with satinwood, and the ceiling has a white ground beautifully decorated, hand-painted decoration being in panels of cream-coloured silk. The furniture and couches being finished in white enamel, white silk cord and blue and gold silk blinds and curtains, of a delicate shade of green, are upheld by silver-plated fittings, ported by small gilt columns at the corners. The floor is carpeted by a rich blue Axminster. The whole of this very beautiful work involved in the Royal train has been executed at the Swindon works, and carriage department, under the direction of the superintendent, Mr. W. Dean, assisted by his chief officers, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Owen, and may add that the fine saloon known as \"Empress of India\" has been similarly decorated for drawing-room purposes, and the whole turnout will be of a very handsome and most efficient character.\n\nIRON FENCING, &c.\n[image of various fences and gates]\nBAYLISS, JONES & BAYLISS,\nCatalogues free on application.\nLONDON OFFICES & SHOW ROOMS, 139 & 141, CANNON ST., E.C.\nWOLVERHAMPTON.\nPLEASE MENTION THIS JOURNAL.",
