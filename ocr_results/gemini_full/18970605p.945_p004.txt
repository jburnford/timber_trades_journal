FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BAYNES, FREDERICK, timber merchant, 15, Micklegate, and Fetter Lane, York, trading as J. Baynes & Son.—The above-named debtor came up for his public examination at the York Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Perkins, on Friday last.
The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £1,025 4s. 5d., and the assets were estimated to produce £2,206 11s. 9d., leaving a surplus of £1,281 7s. 4d. Mr. T. Wilkinson represented the debtor. In answer to questions, the debtor said that he commenced business at 15, Micklegate, in January, 1894. He took over his father's business, which was established in 1815. His father arranged with him to take over the yard, machinery, and stock, and pay him (the father) 30s. a week out of the business. The stock was estimated at £1,400, and the machinery about £800. When he commenced business he had no capital, and his wife had advanced him £350. When he filed his petition there was an overdraft of £481 at the bank, and their security consisted of a life policy valued at £100. His father was also bound for £100 as security. The value of the stock when he filed his petition was £1,300 and the machinery was worth £700.
He had kept a cash book and there were book debts amounting to £200. The Official Receiver: If that is correct you only owe £921 in the pound? Debtor: Yes. How is it you are here? Because the bank pressed me and issued a writ, and I could not raise the money. And to prevent them coming in and seizing and selling you filed your petition? Yes. I may be a little too sanguine. Debtor: It is in good working order. The Registrar: It is a margin. The Official Receiver: We ought to be pay 20s. ; I am afraid there will be nothing left for him. In reply to the Official Receiver, the debtor went on to say that his average profit would be about 30 per cent., and his takings about £1,000 a year. His expenses were about £10 a week, and travelling expenses. He attributed his position to want of capital. If he had had the money he should have kept more stock and travelled more. The examination was ordered to be closed.
MILLS, STEPHEN, builder, Station Road, Midhurst.—The statement of affairs filed herein discloses gross liabilities £3,929 3s. 4d., of which £1,544 17s. 8d. is due to unsecured creditors, £1,655 to creditors partly secured (less estimated value of securities £304 10s., to rank £370 10s.), and £1,915 7s. 8d. to creditors fully secured. The assets consist of stock-in-trade, estimated cost £600, to produce £590; machinery, trade fixtures, &c., £110; household furniture, £100; book debts, estimated to produce £364 4s. 5d., total £1,164 4s. 5d., less preference claims £13 15s. 8d., leaving a deficiency of £764 18s. 7d. The debtor alleges as the cause of failure, "Want of capital, inability to get in my book debts, and being over-stocked." The Official Receiver's observations are: The receiving order was made May 17th, 1897, on the debtor's own petition. He has

only now lodged his statement of affairs. The debtor states that he commenced business in 1874, with a capital of £10, as a carpenter and joiner. He removed to larger premises in 1876 and again in 1879. His business has gradually increased until three years ago, when the takings averaged from £2,500 to £3,000 per annum; but, in consequence of general depression, they have since decreased to about £1,300 per annum. Between the years 1877 and 1890 he built on speculation about seventy cottages and villas at Eastbourne, and the unsold houses there and the premises at Station Road, Midhurst, comprise the securities held by the creditors set out in the statement of affairs as "fully secured" and "partly secured," but, as will be seen, there is no surplus estimated. The books of account kept by the debtor are not sufficient, and he does not appear to have even got out a proper balance-sheet. The business has not been closed pending the decision of the creditors at the meeting.
WESTON, RICHARD, timber merchant, &c., Station Saw Mills, Alfreton, Derbyshire.—In this recent failure, the gross liabilities amount to £3,591 18s. 4d., made up as follows: To unsecured creditors, £2,873 14s. 7d., to fully secured creditors, £704 9s. 3d.; estimated value of securities, £1,010, surplus of £305 10s. 9d. carried to contras to preference creditors, £11 14s. 6d. deducted per contra, being payable in full; and assets, consisting of cash in hand, £20; cash with solicitor, £13; stock in trade, £1,480 0s. 5d.; machiney, £450; trade fixtures, fittings, utensils, &c., £37 70s.; farming stock, £120 11s. 3d.; growing crops, &c., £5; furniture, £15; life policies, £19; book debts, good, £836 13s. 4d.; doubtful and bad £131 19s. 9d., estimated to produce £34 5s., surplus from securities, £305 10s. 9d., making £3,336 10s. 9d., less £11 14s. 6d. for preferential claims, leaving £3,324 16s. 3d., and showing a deficiency of £449 1s. 8d. Alleged cause of failure:—"I do not consider that I am insolvent, but I am unable to continue my business, as I have been called upon for the repayment of a loan of £1,144." It appears the debtor started business in 1875, in copartnership with Samuel Chadburne, at South Normanton, but the partnership only lasted about a year, when it was dissolved by mutual consent. The debtor then started on his own account, in premises he had built on a piece of land belonging to him at South Normanton. He moved to his present premises in 1891. Being called upon for the repayment of a loan and interest amounting to £1,144, and being unable to raise this sum, the debtor, on May 13th last, executed an assignment of all his effects to Mr. W. Watson, of Alfreton, as trustee for the creditors. He, however, decided on May 19th to file his petition.
