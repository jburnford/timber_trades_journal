Johnson\ntion at the Birmingham Bankruptcy Court on Monday. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £1,784 and assets estimated to produce £37. Mr. Adcock appeared for bankrupt. In answer to the Assistant Official Receiver, the debtor said that he commenced business in 1886, at Longton, and failed there. He removed to Birmingham in 1892, and traded as a coal agent; subsequently he traded at Atherstone and Acock's Green, and eventually, in 1896, started as a speculative builder. He had not previously had experience as a builder. He built a number of houses at Handsworth on progressive mortgages. This transaction was disastrous. By the Registrar: He made his calculations on guesswork. When he filed his petition he was being pressed by 27 creditors. The examination was eventually ordered to be adjourned for the signing of the notes.\nDENHAM, HERBERT SYDNEY, builder, Freshwater.—The public examination of this debtor took place at the last sitting of the Newport (Isle of Wight) Bankruptcy Court. The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities amounting to £1,229 12s. 5d., of which £1,095 2s. 5d. represented the claims of creditors fully secured. The estimated value of the securities was £1,200, leaving a surplus of £104 7s. The liabilities expected to rank were returned at £119, and the available assets at £155 17s. 7d., thus showing an estimated surplus of £36 17s. 7d. The debtor, for whom Mr. J. C. Mould appeared, in reply to the Official Receiver, said he commenced business in the Isle of Wight in July of last year. Prior to that he had been in South Africa, working at his trade as a bricklayer. When he returned to England and commenced business he had about £50 of his own money. A fire occurred at his place in February or March last, and what books he kept were then destroyed. Those books showed what the different buildings had cost him. The value of the properties under the mortgages was sufficient to account for the deficiency in his affairs. He did not keep a cash book. His own personal takings from the business would average about £1 a week; he entered that in the book with the wages. Asked when he first found himself in difficulties, debtor said not till the day he filed his petition. In reference to the amount of stock-in-trade on the premises, debtor said it was small, but he had never had more, and he had not sold or otherwise disposed of any. There was an amount due for wages incurred just before he filed his petition, and the wages were in respect of work done at Clay Lane cottages. Those were wages which Mr. Meader was paying, and the work which those wages represented was put into Clay Lane cottages?—Yes. Asked why he went into such large speculative work with so small a capital, debtor said he was trusting to sell a good deal of it. Some other questions were put and answered. The examination was eventually ordered to be closed.\nGREENHALGH, WILLIAM, Bolton Road, Radcliffe, formerly carrying on business in co-partnership with Joseph Cheers, at 127, Bolton Road, as joiners and builders.—This debtor made an application for his discharge at the Bolton County Court last week, before his Honour Judge Jones. The Official Receiver said the receiving order was made on August 19th, 1896, on debtor's own petition. According to his statement of affairs the liabilities of the firm of Greenhalgh & Cheers, to rank for dividend, were estimated at £454 1s. 7d. The assets, so far as they were not assigned to creditors wholly or partly secured, were estimated to produce £375 10s 8d. They had realised £212 8s. 4d., and a first and final dividend of 4s. 11 1/4d. in the pound was paid on the proofs lodged. Mr. Winder submitted that the bankrupt had omitted to keep such books of account as were usual and proper in the business carried on by him, and as sufficiently disclosed his business transactions and financial position. He had also contracted debts after knowing that he was insolvent. The bankrupt's conduct under the proceedings had been satisfactory. Mr. Horrocks having addressed the Court, his Honour admitted there was much to be said in favour of the bankrupt. The discharge was granted, subject to a suspension of three months.\nJONES, MORRIS OWEN, builder, of Ccedpenmaen Road, Pontypridd. — The statutory meeting of the creditors concerned\n\n987\nhereunder, took place last week at the offices of the Official Receiver, Merthyr. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities expected to rank for dividend amounting to £735 8s. 2d. and assets estimated to produce £351 19s. 5d., thus leaving a deficit of £383 8s. 9d. There were also fully secured creditors amounting to £5,865, and the surplus from the securities held by them was returned at £257 10s. Eventually it was resolved to wind up the estate in the usual way.\nREES, THOMAS. This debtor came up for his public examination at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court, last week, before Mr. Registrar Langley. In answer to questions, the debtor said that he had been concerned in contracts for chapels at Merthyr Vale and Abercanaid, but one of these he let to a brother, and received no benefit from it. He had also built 50 to 55 houses at Mountain Pleasant. The causes of failure were chiefly losses on contracts. The statement of affairs showed liabilities ranking amounting to £11,470 12s. 11d., and assets estimated to produce £11,589 17s. 4d., less £118 1s. 5d. Eventually the examination was ordered to be closed.\nBANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.\nRECEIVING ORDERS.\nCOULTHARD BROTHERS, builders, 117, Salters Road, Gosforth, Northumberland.
