890 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. JUNE 12, 1897.

Mackellar & Macphee,
Mahogany, Birch, Walnut, Ash, &c.

Garland & Roger held a public sale on Tuesday, 8th inst, at their Railway Yard, Edinburgh Dock.
There was not a large attendance of buyers, and the competition was correspondingly restricted, but on the whole there was a fair overturn of Baltic and Norwegian deals and battens, also of floorings and linings.
Prices for all fresh goods were firmly maintained, but a number of balances of old parcels were cleared out somewhat under current rates, the selection of lengths being rather short.
The home timber trade is keeping brisk, and not only hardwoods, but fir also, are in good demand, and a large consumption goes on.
