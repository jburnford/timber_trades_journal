The Official Receiver (Mr. James A. Longden), said the case was rather complicated owing to questions of partnership or no partnership. The statements of affairs filed showed the gross liabilities of the joint estate to be £438 18s. 10d., all expected to rank, and the assets to be £17 7s. 2d., all book debts, leaving a deficiency of £417 11s. 8d. In Allison's separate estate the gross liabilities are £1,380 13s. 0d., the most of which, how-ever, is fully secured, the net liabilities being £249 10s. 3d., while the assets are £365 15s. 5d., thus showing a surplus of £116 15s. 2d. In Pounder's separate estate the assets and liabilities are returned respectively as nil. The petitioning creditors are George & W. H. Carter, slate merchants, West Hartlepool. Examined by the Official Receiver, Allison said he and Pounder began partnership in September, 1892, without a deed. They dissolved in January last. At that time they prepared a statement for the purpose of consulting their solicitors, and were advised that it showed them barely solvent if that. The solicitors asked them what they had to lose if they had to call their creditors together. It appeared that Pounder stood to lose all his furniture, and he said he would throw the thing up altogether. Allison then said he would do the same, but after some pressure he changed his mind, and took the business over, under an agreement to take all the assets and pay all the liabilities. He would not, however, have it advertised that way in the \"London Gazette\" for fear all the creditors came down on him at once. It now appeared that some liabilities had been left out of the statement, or it would have shown the firm insolvent. The creditors whom he told of the arrangement would not release Pounder from liability. The firm had done very well at first, but when they got a number of houses built which they did not sell, they started to build on borrowed money, and then they started to lose money. The partners had only drawn about 23s. a week out of the business. Pounder examined said he thought when he left the business he was done with it altogether. The examination was adjourned for three weeks to allow of certain accounts to be supplied. The following are creditors :—\nJoint Estate.\n£ s. d\nJ. & J.

Bankrupt said he had been a carpenter, and having saved about £100, commenced on his own account at Putney Bridge as a speculative builder. He purchased four plots of land, but had only paid the deposit thereon. He, however, had the freeholder, and started building six houses under a building agreement. Had no copy of the latter, and did not know what was in it. He was to be advanced £1,500 on the six houses. Before entering into this agreement he took no steps to ascertain whether the houses could be built for that sum; he commenced them entirely in the dark as to their probable cost. When he sold the houses in April, 1896, he had been advanced under £1,000, and he had never received the balance owed £400 to builders' merchants. His own drawings were then 50s. per week, although his position as an employer had not improved to what it was as a journey-man. The only property he had in August last was worth £40. In July, 1896, he entered into a contract to build two houses for a Mr. Fisher. He did not tender for the work, but was told by the architect that he could do them at £649 each, and he (bankrupt) agreed to build them at that price. He took no steps to ascertain whether the price or not; was in-curred. He would not have signed the contract had he known that was in it. He would employ a solicitor to peruse the contract, but was told it was not necessary. The architect had power to take possession of all stock, plant, &c., on the premises, and in January did so. He considered he had only received about £500 on account of this contract. The Official Receiver stated the architect had rendered an account seating he had advanced or paid on debtor's behalf £1,033 on account of this con-tract. Bankrupt said he could not deny that. His failure was due to losses on this contract. The amounts paid to builders' merchants had been paid by the architect; he (bankrupt) did not do so, as he had never been given the chance. Denied representing in August, 1896, that he had £200, no liabilities, but admitted stating he had a profitable contract with Mr. Fisher. A private meeting of his creditors was held, but the creditors decided to have the matter investigated. Denied having removed or sold any furniture. After bankrupt had been examined by creditors present an adjournment until July 8th was granted.\nJOHNSON, J.,\nbuilder, North Shields.—This debtor appeared for his public examination at the Newcastle Bankruptcy Court, last week, before Mr. Registrar Ingledew; but, upon the application of the Official Receiver, the examination was ordered to be adjourned for three weeks. Nothing of importance transpired.\nPARR, JOHN,\nbuilder, 24, Cathles Road, Balham Hill, London, and 110, Gaskarth Road, S.W.—The first meeting of the creditors con-cerned hereunder took place recently, at the offices of the Official Receiver for the Wands-worth district, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E., under the presidency of Mr. Mackintosh, senior Official Receiver. It was decided to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.\nSANDERSON, HENRY,\nbuilder, 6, Sculcoates Lane, Hull.—The public examination of this debtor came on for hearing on Monday last at the Hull Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver the debtor stated that he commenced business about five years ago, with a capital of £45. His statement of affairs filed under the bankruptcy showed\n\nAUSTRIAN WAINSCOT OAK.\nJ. H. ROWNTREE, 30, Great St. Helens. LONDON, E.C.\nTELEGRAMS—\"GRAOBNOTE, LONDON.\"",
