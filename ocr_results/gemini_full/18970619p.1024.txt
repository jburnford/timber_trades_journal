1024 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. JUNE 19, 1897.

LEITH.
The arrivals of wood goods this week are comparatively few and unimportant, consisting merely of 2,600 pcs. from "Buda" (s), from Libau; 3,814 pine deals and ends per "Ganges" (s), from Montreal; 7 pcs. oak per "Thorsa" (s), from Copenhagen; 6,431 deals and battens per "Idog," from Soderhamn.
John Mitchell & Co. held their annual sale on Tuesday, 15th inst., at their Leith Walk Saw-mills. The weather was favourable, and the attendance of buyers was large and representative. The chief attraction of the sale was a steamer cargo of waney board pine timber and hardwood. A large selection of yellow pine deals, boards, sidings, and strips, being the first arrival of the new season's shipments from Quebec. The waney pine timber was an exceptionally fine shipment, and was very quickly cleared at prices ranging from 2s. 8d. to 3s. 7d. per cubic foot. The hardwood also sold well, birch fetching 1s. 9d., ash 2s. 3d. and hickory same figure. Of the yellow pine sawn goods, large sales were made from 3s. 4d. for long and broad 1st quality deals, 3s. for regulars, and 2s. 8d. to 2s. 10d. for shorter lengths. A considerable quantity of 2 in. 1st and 1½ in. 1st quality yellow pine boards was also placed for 2s. 8d. for 2 in. and 1½ in., for 1 in., which was likewise the ruling price for 6 and 3x3 yellow pine strips. Third pine deals 3x11 sold freely from 1s. 4½d., and 4th quality from 1s. per cubic ft. A large line of Canary whitewood logs was disposed of at prices from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 9d., and averaging about 1s. 6d. per cubic ft.
It was somewhat late before the Baltic goods were reached, and the advanced prices required for the fresh importations from that quarter rather checked the demand. There was, notwithstanding a fair quantity of the various descriptions of deals and battens placed, some large lines of floorings, linings, and sarkings, which were also disposed of at very satisfactory prices. John Mitchell & Co.'s annual sales are generally very successful, but the large overturn of American goods on this occasion and the excellent prices obtained, especially for the waney board timber, make the present sale particularly noteworthy.
