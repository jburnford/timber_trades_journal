Wiener & Co.\nGAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nBENTLEY, joiner, Webster Lane, Scholes.—The Official Receiver for the Bradford district has now issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the debtor has filed a statement of affairs showing liabilities amounting to £481 2s. 5d., expected to rank against the estate for dividend.\nThe assets are estimated to produce £109 18s. 5d., thus leaving a deficiency of £371 4s.\nThe debtor alleges his failure to have been caused through competition, want of capital, bad debts, and expenses in connection with illness and death in his family.\nIt appears from the report and observations of the Official Receiver that the debtor commenced business about 35 years ago, with a capital of £10, as a joiner and builder, at Scholes.\nHe has not kept a proper set of books of account, and cannot give correct figures respecting his affairs.\nHis turnover at one time was about £10 per week, but during the last eighteen months it had not amounted to more than £2 per week.\nCARTER, H. C., builder, Gosta Green, Birmingham.—The committee of inspection convened a meeting of the creditors concerned under this deed of assignment executed by this debtor, on his failure at the Grand Hotel, Birmingham, last week, for the purpose of considering a claim made by Mr. George Cadbury, in respect of building contracts entered into by the debtor\n\nJune 26, 1897.\nat Bournville for the erection of two pairs of houses at that place.\nMr. Sharp appeared for the debtor, and Mr. E. E. Sparrow, the trustee, presented his formal account showing a dividend of 5s. 11d. in the pound.\nIt was explained that the amount the dividend would have realised was larger, but, instead of receiving the full amount of the contracts entered into by the debtor, there was on the materials to the value of £762 10s. to be deducted, and there was on the other contracts a loss of £1,259, against which there had been made amounts leaving about £900 to be divided amongst the creditors.\nThe proofs amounted to £2,097, but if Mr. Cadbury had not made the claim the amount would be reduced to £1,049.\nThe debtor estimated that the houses could be finished for £1,200, but the materials deducted from the cost of completion, whereas the claim practically amounted to Mr. Cadbury for fuller charges.\nThe trustee said that a lot of work had been done which was not specified.\nMr. Wildsmith said that the claim he would spend the assets in resisting it.—Mr. Cadbury's solicitor said that it was not his client's wish to press the matter, but he was suggested by a creditor that the matter should be referred to Mr. I. Bradley as arbitrator, and Mr. Wildsmith suggested that it would be better be appointed to wait upon Mr. Cadbury, and this suggestion was unanimously agreed to, the meeting being passed \"That a deputation be appointed to wait upon Mr. Cadbury with the object of arriving at a settlement, and in the event of Mr. Cadbury refusing to receive the deputation that they be requested to join with them in referring the matter in dispute to Mr. I. Bradley as arbitrator.\"\nThe meeting was then concluded.\nPATENTS. — G. F.
