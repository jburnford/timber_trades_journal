Business continues active, although the Queen's Jubilee holiday on the 22nd occasioned here, as over the kingdom generally, an entire cessation of work for the day. A large number of wood-laden steamers and sailing vessels are now on passage, and there is every prospect of a brisk importation during the next few weeks. Fortunately the consumption keeps well up, and with the resumption of wood goods is keeping generally in the prices, and the trade is likewise satisfactory.

A SCOTCH LAW SUIT SETTLED.
W. ANDERSON AND CO. v. J. FLETCHER.
In the Court of Session, Edinburgh, last week, it was stated that a settlement had been arrived at in an action brought by William Anderson & Co., timber merchants, of Glasgow, against John Fletcher, of May Villa, Kinghorn, in which the plaintiff sought to recover £250 on the delivery of 860 fir sleepers. The record showed that the plaintiff purchased a cargo of sleepers from the defendant for £250 in respect of them, on board the steamship "Grandholme," which had been wrecked on the Isles of Jura in June, 1893. They removed a number of sleepers, but being unable to get the remainder at the time, they left them, but they maintained that they left the sleepers in a position of safety. In October, 1893, the defendant purchased the wreck, and he took the sleepers to Belfast. He salved the sleepers, and maintained that he took them to Belfast, as the most convenient port, taking into consideration the stormy weather which prevailed at the time. He further maintained that before he gave up the sleepers he was entitled to be paid for salvage services rendered. The plaintiffs replied that there was no salvage, and that all defendant was entitled to be paid for was the stacking of the sleepers on the beach at Jura. The terms of the settlement did not transpire.

VISIT TO THE ALBERT SAWMILLS, ABERDEEN.
The members of the Aberdeen Scotch Mechanical Society visited on 12th inst. the Albert Sawmills—Messrs. J. Fleming & Co., Limited. They were met by Mr. James Cumming, representative partner, and Mr. James Smith, mill manager. There was a good turnout of members, and on the suggestion of Mr. A. Sproul, president of the Society, the party were divided into two groups—the one conducted by Mr. Cumming, the other part by Mr. Sproul (hunter, the works engineer, and Mr. James Hunter, the works manager), Mr. Sproul taking this duty from his familiarity with the whole arrangements, having acted as the firm's consulting engineer for the restoration of the new mills after the disastrous fire which destroyed the mills a year ago. The engines were put in motion, and a staff of men went along with the two companies to show the various machines in motion, and the class of work each was capable of doing. The mill, which has just been completed, embodies all that experience could suggest for its equipment, and it is undoubtedly the acknowledged mill of the kind in the kingdom.
