Trading at 20, Church Street, Brighton. The above-named bankrupt was publicly examined before Mr. Registrar Jennings at the Brighton Bankruptcy Court. Replying to questions, he said he had been for some years a jobbing builder, and had commenced business with very little capital. He had a freehold of 61, Preston Street, and had built and improved the house by adding two rooms. When he married, his wife had some furniture, and had carried on the business in Preston Street since 1889. He had paid his wife in that business. She had not paid him any rent for the house. He had built five houses in Portland Road. He had borrowed about £50 of his own, and had then about £300. The house in Preston Street was mortgaged for £950. The house in Portland Road cost £1,032 to build, and he had borrowed £2,880 on them. He had sold one house for £450, but lost money on it. He began to be pressed by creditors for expenses. He sold the house in Preston Street in 1892 and after paying off mortgage interest and expenses he had a sum of £155 with which to pay his creditors. He had never had a banking account. Eventually the examination was ordered to be closed.\n\nBECKETT, C. ROGER, timber merchant, of Myrtle Terrace, Dalton-in-Furness, lately residing at 7, Croslands Park Road, Barrow-in-Furness, and carrying on business at Hindpool Road, Barrow-in-Furness, under the style of Beckett & Co., and at 16, Piccadilly, Bradford—The first meeting of creditors in this case was held at the Station Hotel, Carnforth, on December 22nd. The liabilities expected to rank amounted to £4,919, including £1,866 due to 68 unsecured creditors per list, and £2,800 to creditors for uncompleted contracts. The assets are estimated to produce £1,183, thus showing a deficiency of £3,036. The Official Receiver, in his observations, states that the receiving order was made on the petition of the debtor himself, and he has not been adjudicated a bankrupt. He commenced business in Barrow in October 1895, having previously been in partnership with his father in a similar business at St. Helens. He states that he had about £650 capital when he came to Barrow. The debtor appears to have become liable on a very large number of bills of exchange, many of which are evidently accommodation bills, and he has also had considerable dealings with money lenders. As lately as the beginning of November last he purchased the business which he carried on at Bradford as \"Forshaw & Co.,\" and which had previously been known as \"J. Taylor & Co,\" from a Mr. Wakefield, but the whole transaction appears to have been one of bills, and no cash payments seem to have been made. There is another firm of \"Rogers & Co.,\" carrying on business at 46A, Market Street, Manchester, with which the debtor has had very intimate relations, but he denies that he carried on business under that name or was a member of the firm. The business at Bradford has been to some extent kept open, as it is supposed to have some value as a going concern, but no business has been done at Barrow. The stock, &c., appears, so far as the Official Receiver can judge, to be much over-estimated. Very considerable expenses were incurred prior to the petition being filed, by executions being allowed to be levied, and in three cases sums amounting to over £100 were paid to creditors to avoid executions very shortly before. The debtor's explanations have been so far unsatisfactory. He has not scheduled his furniture, and he told the Official Receiver that it was settled on his wife. No document has been produced to the Official Receiver to prove this, and he has claimed it as part of his estate. The books have been very imperfectly kept. Mr. Joseph E. Scott, manager of the Timber Trades Association, was appointed trustee, with Mr. F. J. Crossfield, of Barrow, Mr. Wm. Thomas, of Lightbound, Rigby & Co., of Liverpool, and Mr. Wm. Agnew Mairs, bank manager, as a committee of inspection.\n\nGARDINER, GEORGE, builder, Kingswood, Bristol.—The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this failure took place on December 23rd at the offices of the Official Receiver, Bristol. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £855 3s. 10d., and the deficiency was estimated at £552 7s. 1d. The Official Receiver reported that the debtor, who was erroneously described in the receiving order as a builder, began business as a timber merchant in 1890 with a capital of £200. Two years later he effected a private arrangement, under which his creditors were paid a composition of 7s. 6d. in the pound on liabilities amounting to £1,800. He had failed again in the early part of 1895 with liabilities amounting to £2,300, and with estimated assets to produce about £700. Under this latter arrangement the estate was re-sold to the debtor, the trustee taking in exchange promissory notes for 6s. 8d. in the pound at three months.\n\nTELEGRAMS: \"DANWRIGHT, CINCINNATI.\"\nMALEY, T[?] & C\nEXPORTER\nWALNUT & C\nSpecial Orders given particular attention.\nGeneral Offices",
