  "text": "28\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nJANUARY 1, 1898.\n\nWILLIAM DENOVAN,\nLEITH.\nThe arrivals for the last week of the year are of an unimportant character, consisting merely of 15,401 deals and battens and 9,767 pieces lathwood, per \"Calabria\" (s), from Riga; 3,000 oak staves, per \"Ceroma\" (s), from New York; 100 logs oak, 149 sleepers, and 81,132 oak staves, per \"Peritia\" (s), from Libau. The \"Croma\" (s) above referred to, which brought a general cargo from New York, is a large steamer of fully 2,000 tons register, and in coming up the Firth of Forth stranded on the island of Inchkeith owing to fog, and although the Salvage Company was successful in getting her off after 48 hours, there has been considerable damage to cargo through water in the forehold.\nBusiness has still kept moving along this week, but next week will be a black one, there being a general cessation of work the opening week of the year. Stocks in importers' hands at the close of the year are large, the importation having been a record one, probably 15 to 20 per cent. above that of previous year, so that notwithstanding the undoubtedly large consumption the balance on hand is ample. In view of the advanced prices asked by shippers for next season's goods, this is a satisfactory position, and should enable importers here to act cautiously, and rather make the most of their stocks than commit themselves to large forward engagements.\nIt is only fitting that some notice should be taken here of the death of Mr. R. A. Rennie, who passed away on December 20th, at Weston-super-Mare. It is some years now since Mr. Rennie, owing to failing health, relinquished the business of timber agent which he had carried on here for many years, but he had not a few friends in this district, as well as in Glasgow, Grangemouth, and throughout Scotland, who must have learned of his death with sincere regret, and to whom this slight tribute to his memory will be grateful.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nDec. 21 St. Kevin-Rotterdam 2 lds. hoops-R.

BEATTIE, TIMBER BROKER & SURVEYOR,\nTELEPHONE No. 578.\nIMPORTER OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF WOOD GOODS,\n17, BALTIC STREET, LEITH.\n\nCALDER, HENDERSON & LIVINGSTON.\nWith the opening of the year a new firm of timber brokers styled as above takes a place in the timber trade of Glasgow, with offices at 109, St. Vincent Street. The members of it have long been well known in connection with the business of Allison, Cousland & Co., where they have had large experience, and from their marked ability in their several departments they are well met as partners, forming a strong and efficient combination for successfully conducting the business of timber in all its various branches.\nIt would, we know, be distasteful to them to speak otherwise than quietly and moderately as to their future course, but it may safely be said that by the exercise of those qualities, and with the influence they are known to possess, they have the prospect of speedily taking a good and assured position in the trade. At this, the season when kindly sentiments are heard on all sides, we join their many friends in wishing a prosperous year to the new firm, and, as they say here, \"mony o' them.\"\nAs a first-rate salesman and auctioneer, Mr. W. R. Calder is known far and near, his alert, clever style being familiar not only in the Glasgow district but in other parts of the country where his services as auctioneer have been frequently in requisition. A native of Arbroath, his earliest experience of the timber trade was gained there while serving an apprenticeship to a timber merchant and contractor.\nIn conducting public sales he first made his mark twenty years ago in connection with a Dundee firm of timber merchants, where he held the position of principal salesman. With this early training he was well fitted for rendering good service when he entered the brokerage business about fourteen years ago, as salesman to the then firm of Allison, Cousland, & Co., or as it was then known, Allison Cousland, & Hamilton, and in their varied and extensive business his energies have had active employment; he is thoroughly conversant with the handling of the various wood goods imported to Clyde as Quebec timber and deals, pine, teak, oak, U.S. oak, walnut, pitch pine, &c. The public sales of the firm at Greenock and in Glasgow have been conducted by him; they are generally held indoors, buyers previously inspecting the woods—mahogany but in selling furniture lots to be offered, walnut, &c., the custom there still is for auctions to take place in the open, usually at Queen's Dock, where the wood is piled. In acting as auctioneer at these out-door sales that, which Mr. Calder has, physical and mental, which moves rapidly from lot to lot, holding closely the attention of the company (this refers to the occasion when he is selling or perhaps scolding down opposition requires, and, legitimate means of knocking down or withdrawing every lot, in short, using every legal to bring out for the importer the best possible results.\nMr. Livingston and Mr. Henderson are equally well fitted for taking part with Mr. Calder in the management of the new concern, having been long known and highly esteemed in their respective departments.\nMr. Henderson, who has had an experience of 20 years with his late employers, takes charge of the inside work, and is an adept in all matters relating to settlements of freights, &c., his knowledge of detail and natural acuteness making him very capable in guarding shippers' interests.\nMr. Livingston, during the long time—fifteen years or thereabouts—that he was with his late employers, gained experience of the business in all its branches. His dislike of publicity forbids much being said, but we feel confidence in stating that during the years he has gone in and out among the trade as salesman he has won a high place in their regard by his intelligence, courtesy, and fairness of disposition, and his influence will do much to popularise the new firm.\nIts members all enjoy a reputation for steadiness of character, and we have no doubt its conduct will be governed by principles of integrity without which no business can rightly prosper.\n\nWe regret to announce the death on December 20 of Mr. A. R. Rennie, for many years retired from business. Mr. Rennie was a well-known timber agent. Mr. Rennie was the eldest son of the late Dr. Rennie, M.D.\n\nMITCHELL THOMSON & CO.,\nTimber Merchants,\nGRANTON SAW-MILLS.\nOffice—9, SOUTH ST.
