The only fresh arrival since last writing has been the \"Ava\" (s), from Rangoon, with consignments of teak to a considerable amount, chiefly for Edmiston and Mitchells, and contract through them for delivery from ship's side to shipbuilders, &c. The holidays occurring at this time are a cause of some little delay in effecting deliveries. Singleton, Dunn, & Co. and Cant & Kemp have received consignments of teak planks and scantlings by same steamer, also there is discharging at Princes Dock the \"Hestia\" (s), from Baltimore, her cargo comprising large parcels of hardwoods. Particulars are appended of the stocks of Quebec pine deals at Glasgow as at 31st ult.\n\nQuebec 1st pine deals ... Pcs. ...

Lower Port spruce deals are 240 standards down compared with September 30th, and Lower Port pine deals snow a small increase, about 190 standards.\nThe imports of Lower port deals, spruce mostly, during the last quarter of the year were upwards of 3,000 St. Petersburg standards, and it is satisfactory to note, from comparison of stock, that the consumption or deliveries to consumers for this period have been equal to the imports.\n\nLEITH.\nSince last report, there are the following arrivals, the first three coming under the old year and the rest falling to be included in the new, viz., 327 pieces poplar and 12 logs oak, per \"Prodano\" (s), from Baltimore, 3,406 battens and 7,057 pieces lathwood, per \"Czar\" (s), from Riga, 41,520 oak staves, per \"Erik Berntsen,\" from Memel, 8,384 pieces lumber, per \"Arthur Fitger,\" from Port Blakely, 145,200 oak staves per \"Therese Horn,\" from Memel, 4,759 bundles hoops, per \"Dronning Sophie,\" from Nantes, 8,348 deals and battens and 3,614 pieces lathwood, per \"Penelope\" (s), from Riga. The most important item in the above arrivals is the cargo of Oregon pine per \"Arthur Fitger,\" from Puget Sound, the consignees being Forslind & Rex.\nAs usual with the opening week of the year, business has been practically suspended, but now that the holidays are over a fresh start will be made.\n\nRobert Hamilton & Co.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n75, ST.
