TRADE REPORTS.

GLASGOW.
Owing to this being the New Year holiday, when public works are closed, there is little business to report. The only fresh arrival since last writing has been the "Ava" (s), from Rangoon, with consignments of teak to a considerable amount, chiefly for Edmiston and Mitchells, and contract through them for delivery from ship's side to shipbuilders, &c. The holidays occurring at this time are a cause of some little delay in effecting deliveries. Singleton, Dunn, & Co. and Cant & Kemp have received consignments of teak planks and scantlings by same steamer, also there is discharging at Princes Dock the "Hestia" (s), from Baltimore, her cargo comprising large parcels of hardwoods. Particulars are appended of the stocks of Quebec pine deals at Glasgow as at 31st ult.

Imports of Quebec deals and ends during the last quarter of the year were pretty heavy, and stocks of the various qualities have been considerably augmented as compared with the amounts at September 30th last, the only item showing a decrease being red pine deals. Lower Port spruce deals are 240 standards down compared with September 30th, and Lower Port pine deals snow a small increase, about 190 standards.
The imports of Lower port deals, spruce mostly, during the last quarter of the year were upwards of 3,000 St. Petersburg standards, and it is satisfactory to note, from comparison of stock, that the consumption or deliveries to consumers for this period have been equal to the imports.

LEITH.
Since last report, there are the following arrivals, the first three coming under the old year and the rest falling to be included in the new, viz., 327 pieces poplar and 12 logs oak, per "Prodano" (s), from Baltimore, 3,406 battens and 7,057 pieces lathwood, per "Czar" (s), from Riga, 41,520 oak staves, per "Erik Berntsen," from Memel, 8,384 pieces lumber, per "Arthur Fitger," from Port Blakely, 145,200 oak staves per "Therese Horn," from Memel, 4,759 bundles hoops, per "Dronning Sophie," from Nantes, 8,348 deals and battens and 3,614 pieces lathwood, per "Penelope" (s), from Riga. The most important item in the above arrivals is the cargo of Oregon pine per "Arthur Fitger," from Puget Sound, the consignees being Forslind & Rex.
As usual with the opening week of the year, business has been practically suspended, but now that the holidays are over a fresh start will be made.
