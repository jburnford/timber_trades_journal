ANNUAL CIRCULAR.
EDMISTON & MITCHELL.
In reviewing the timber trade for the year now ending, a large import has to be recorded; while it is gratifying to observe that the absorption of goods of all kinds has kept pace fairly well with the supply. For the first half of the year the shipbuilding industry was in a very satisfactory condition, but the engineers' strike, which has now existed for about six months, has changed what would have been an extremely large into only a moderate year's output of work. Fortunately very extensive housebuilding operations throughout the district have necessitated a large consumption of timber, tending thus to neutralise the comparative paucity of shipbuilding orders, and prices may be said to have been well maintained. The amount of tonnage launched from Clyde shipyards in 1897 is 340,037, while the work on hand is 386,000, which, together with a rise in freights, tends to indicate a favourable outlook for this important industry during the year to come. The total value of

the output for 1897 is about £8,250,000, against £9,000,000 for 1896. The import of logs from Quebec and Montreal has been on a somewhat similar scale to that of last year, the only marked difference being in white pine, red pine, and ash, in which items the import shows a considerable falling off, though possibly ample for all likely demands. In lumber of all descriptions the import is rather larger than last year, but deals of all qualities, with the exception perhaps of fourth pine, which have come forward too freely, have met with a steady demand at fair prices. In spruce the import has been unusually large, but not altogether disproportionate to the demand, and values may be said to have been fairly well maintained. The teak trade has been in a healthy condition, and, notwithstanding the comparative scarcity of shipbuilding orders recently, prices have remained firm throughout the year. In mahogany the imports have been principally confined to small steamer shipments from Boston, U.S. (both round and square logs), which have met with a good reception at satisfactory prices. Of walnut, oak, and other hardwoods, a considerable volume of business has been done, but, owing to the import rather exceeding the demand, prices have in some cases shown a weaker tendency. A large business has been done in pitch pine, but owing to heavy stocks there has been no improvement in prices.

EDINBURGH AND LEITH MASTER BUILDERS' ASSOCIATION DINNER.
The Annual Dinner of the Edinburgh and Leith Master Builders' Association was held recently in the Royal British Hotel, Princes Street, Mr. John Lownie, President, in the Chair. The Chairman, in opening the proceedings after dinner, said the question of labour had been dogging their footsteps for years, and as an association they had had a share in the fight that was at present disturbing the country. What he wished to lay before them was the question as to whether there was no remedy for the present state of matters in connection with labour? Were there no means whereby the employers could win over the better disposed of their workmen, and at once free the men and themselves from the

tyranny of mischief makers? He was afraid that before peace and freedom of action with workmen were again established, the battle would have to be fought out. He believed, however, that when the battle was over, it would be the duty of all employers to seek the good, and win the confidence, of their workers by a system of insurance, to which both should contribute. He was persuaded that if that could be carried out, happy relations that existed would largely disappear. He was sure that they had no wish that their employes should work under adverse conditions. What they desired, and what they must have, was, that freedom of action in the conduct of their business which ought to exist in a great and free country like theirs. "The Magistrates and Town Councils of Edinburgh and Leith" was proposed by the Chairman, and Councillor Menzies responded, and Councillor Graham Youll also replied for the Leith Corporation. At a later stage of the proceedings, Councillor Graham Youll proposed "The Edinburgh and Leith Master Builders' Association," and in doing so, spoke of its usefulness to its members. Its membership, he said, now numbered 110. As showing how the trade was extending and the consumption increasing, he would refer to the branch in which he was most interested. When he first remembered it, twenty years ago, the consumption of cement in Edinburgh and Leith was a few hundred tons per annum. Ten years ago it mounted up to the large quantity of something like 10,000 tons, and they would be surprised when he told them that from January 1st, 1896, to October 13th last, 83,470 tons of cement were imported into the port of Leith. In former years all the cement used came from their own country, but, out of the 83,000 referred to, no less than 4,733 tons were imported from Belgium, which was formerly the extent, going into It was a serious matter. The wages in Belgium were very much less than in this country, and British manufacturers, at the present time at all events, were unable to compete with the Belgians. With the machinery they possessed, and cheap labour, thep would, undoubtedly, be very serious competitors to their trade. — Mr. Peter Whyte responded.

WRECK OF A PITCH PINE SHIP.—The Glasgow iron ship, "Blairgowrie," 1,646 tons, with a full cargo of pitch pine, has been run down on the Scheldt by the North German Lloyd steamer "Bonn." It was found necessary to run her ashore. All the crew are safe.
