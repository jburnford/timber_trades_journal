FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
AMPHLETT, THOMAS, joiner and wheelwright, 86, Welford Road, and residing at 33, Filbert Street, Leicester. — The Official Receiver has now issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the debtor has filed a statement of affairs showing a deficiency of £216. The debtor, in explanation of his failure, states, among other things, that he commenced business without any capital of his own, and that the competition in the district is very keen. It appears from the report and observations of the Official Receiver that the receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition. When he commenced in July, 1890, he borrowed £25, which he afterwards repaid. The liabilities were all in respect of trade debts. The landlord distrained for rent before the receiving order was made. The only book of account kept by the debtor was a day book. He had not lodged any deficiency account. As there is no offer of composition forthcoming from the debtor he has been adjudicated bankrupt.
ATHERTON & DOLMAN, builders, Poplar, E.—The receiving order in this case was made on the petition of W. & J. R. Hunter, timber merchants, Bethnal Green Road, and the sitting for public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The joint statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £13,753, of which £10,852 are unsecured, and assets £4,255. Creditors :—

The bankrupts ascribed their failure mainly to losses on contracts and depreciation in the value of their stock, plant, &c., as estimated for realisation. Mr. E. L. Hough appeared as Official Receiver, and Mr. Buckmaster for the trustee ; Mr. James and Mr. Howard attending in other interests. The examination was concluded.
CAMPION, WM. CHAS, joiner, 19 Prestonville Terrace, Brighton.—The above-named debtor made an application for an administration order at the Brighton County Court, on Friday, before his Honour Judge Martineau. The debtor said he proposed to pay his creditors 20s. in the £ by instalments of 10s. per month. Eventually his Honour made an order for the payment of the debts in full by instalments of £1 per month.
FRANCIS, FREDERICK, builder and contractor, Portland Road, Colchester.—This debtor appeared for his adjourned public examination at the Colchester Bankruptcy Court on Friday, before the Registrar. The debtor was questioned at some length with regard to certain contracts, to the losses on which he attributed his present position. It appeared from the debtor that he had an account lodged by the debtor that he had lost as much as two-thirds of his capital on one contract. The examination was eventually ordered to be closed.
GAMBLE, BEN, builder, Fleckney.—The public examination of this debtor took place at the Leicester Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Ingram on the 6th inst. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £750 18s., and the assets, after deducting the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, were esticated to produce £179. The examination was ordered to be adjourned until the next court, for the purpose of enabling the debtor to file an amended deficiency account.
GILLOTT, BENJAMIN, joiner, 24, Cambridge Street, Cleethorpes.—This debtor was publicly examined before Mr. Registrar Stephens, last week. In answer to the Official Receiver, he said he commenced business 20 years ago, with a small capital. He alleged his failure to have been caused through bad trade, sickness and death of his wife. He was aware of his insolvent position 12 months ago, but he continued in business hoping for better times. His wife died of consumption four years. He of course had to leave his business to attend to her, and this together with the medical expenses had been the principal causes of his failure.
GUNN, STEPHEN, builder, Harwich.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor was held on Friday at the Colchester Bankruptcy Court before the Registrar. It appeared that the debtor had returned a debt as £7, whereas the creditor had proved for £150. Mr. Young, on behalf of the debtor, said that £7 was all his client was owing the creditor in question, and he did not wish to put the court in possession of any information required as to what the debt was, as it would be to hold a private examination. He understood the creditor would not consent to that course, and the trustee would not consent to that course, on the ground that the debtor had been adjudicated. The Registrar, in adjourning the examination to the next court, said it was best to have the matter up.
ETWELL, SOLDEN, builder and contractor, Wisbech, Cambs.—The gross liabilities are returned at £8,217 6s. 7d., made up as follows: to unsecured creditors, £6,923 3s. 9d.; to fully secured creditors, £1,289 3s. 8d., estimated value of securities, £2,172, surplus of £882 16s. 4d. carried to contra, and assets consisting of cash in hand £300, stock in trade in life, machinery £53, stock (5 horses) £70, book debts, good £507 1s., doubtful £10 10s. estimated to realise £5 15s., bills from securities £882 16s. 4d., making £1,819 2s. 4d., less £44 19s. 2d. for preference claims, which leaves £2 444 13s. 2d. and shows a deficiency of £4,480 10s. 7d.
