A member complained that some one\nhad already sawn away a piece of the tree. Mr.\nMark Sykes, who is a geologist as well as a Town\nCouncillor, said the tree had been given to him\nby the contractor and by the common consent\nof the committee. Several members disputed\nMr. Sykes's claim, and the Town clerk said he\nthought the tree was the property of the Corporation.\nAnother member said that if they\ncould not see out and allowed it to dry properly\nthey would have a most valuable piece of timber\nwith which to make the furniture for the proposed\nnew Town Hall. They would then possess\nsome of the most unique suites of furniture in\nthe kingdom. The Mayor said a gentleman\nhad written to him suggesting that the tree\nshould be sent to London and dried by the\nelectric process on the top of one of the buildings.\nThey must not be allowed to chop the tree\nup. The chairman of the Sewage Committee\nremarked that many people had already made\nclaims to the tree. Not satisfied with that they\nhad broken open the powder magazine, which\nwas said to contain powder but beer, and helped\nthemselves to the liquor. The committee would\ndo their best to preserve this tree if it could be\ndone with safety.\n\nTIMBER CONTRACT.\nOPEN.\nPAVING BLOCKS.—For the supply of\nabout 60,000 red deal blocks, or any smaller\nquantity of not less than 50,000, for street\npaving purposes, for the Ipswich Town Council.\nCopies of specification and form of tender, and\nany further information, on application to Mr.\nE.

The past\nfortnight, as is usual at this season, has\nbeen very much of a holiday-time, occupied\nin stocktaking, and the market, as a\nmatter of course, has shown little movement.\nThe indications of trade generally\nthroughout the country are of continued\nactivity, and there is a hopeful outlook\nfor the timber trade, in connection\nwith housebuilding requirements especially.\nShipbuilding is still hampered by\nthe dispute in the engineering trade, and\nthe shipbuilding demand for timber is to\nsome extent restricted. Present stocks of\nteak and pitch pine are sufficient to meet\nrequirements for some time, but at the rate\nof consumption experienced during the past\nyear would soon show a diminution, provided\nsupplies meantime are limited. Last year's consumption of pitch\npine for Clyde ports was 53,800 loads. The\nimports amounted to 62,000 loads, and stock\nat close of the year 34,700 loads. Teak imports\nto Glasgow for the year were 8,378 loads logs\nand 510 loads planks, and to Glasgow 5,669\nloads logs and 2,952 loads planks. A total consumption of 13,738 loads logs\nand planks for the year is indicated, the\nstock at close showing a considerable increase\nin logs as compared with the stock\nat Dec. 31st, 1896.\nThe arrivals at Glasgow during the past\nweek have included the \"Keen,\" (s),\nfrom St. John, N.B., which landed a cargo\nof about 9,000 spruce deals for Allison,\nCousland, & Co.; also Quebec deals and\nends, being some balances forwarded via St.\nJohn, consigned to Allison, Cousland, &\nCo., and F. A. Lightbody & Co.\nUnited States hardwood imports are represented\nby parcels per \"Amaryathia\" (s),\ndischarging at Queen's Dock, comprising\nvarious consignments oak planks, &c. Last\nyear's imports of oak arriving weekly per\nliners from the States amounted to 17,480\nloads planks and boards, and 705 loads logs.\nThere were also arrivals of oak planks to a\nconsiderable amount per liners from Quebec\nand Montreal during the season.\nThe \"Indralema\" (s), from Newport News,\nis due, and brings sundry parcels of walnut\nlogs and boards, canary whitewood &c.,\nparticulars of which will be given next\nweek. At the piling ground, Queen's Dock,\nwe notice that during the last few days\nseveral consignments of African mahogany\nlogs—of direct imports via Liverpool—have\nbeen stored by Cant & Kemp. This market\nis at present quite bare of Honduras and\nTabasco mahogany; last auction was on the\n21st ult., when the Honduras cargo, ex\n\"Fornjot,\" Allison, Cousland, & Co., brokers,\nwas all cleared, meeting with an eager\ndemand. There is good opening for further\nimports.\n\nLEITH.\nThere are the following arrivals to report\nviz., 39,500 oak staves and 42 wainscot logs\nper \"Orient\" (s), from Libau; 1,407 sawn\npitch pine logs and 376 deals, per \"Killy,\"\nfrom Pensacola; 6 oak logs, 30 walnut logs,\n80 poplar logs, and 18,475 oak staves, per\n\"Kildona \" (s) from Newport News and\nNorfolk. The cargo of pitch pine timber is\nfor Park, Dobson, & Co., and the other\narrivals are divided among various receivers.\n\nROBERT HAMILTON & Co.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n75, ST.

The cargo of\nOregon pine timber and deals discharging, ex\n\"Arthur Fitger,\" from Port Blakely (Puget\nSound), is attracting general attention; this\nwood has hitherto been very little used in\nthis district, and a large slow of sale in the\npresent one is likely to take a considerable time to distribute.\n\nIMPORTS.\nALLOA.\nJan. 4 Aerial-Fredrikstad-215 lds. hewn fir pit\nprops Kirkwood & Co.\n\nARDROSSAN.\nJan. 8 Martaga-Darien-280 lds. hewn fir-J\nPaton & Son.\n\nBO'NESS.\nJan. 3 Hermod (s)-Hamburg-350 lds. hewn fir\nprops-J.
