THE GREAT BOG OAK.
LOCAL SENTIMENT.
The recent unearthing of a giant oak tree,
some 60ft. long, with branches, during some
sewerage excavations near Stockport, appears to
have provided an exciting topic of discussion
at last week's meeting of the Town Council.
One member suggested that the tree was many
thousand years old—older, indeed, than Cheops'
pyramid at Geedle—and ought to be preserved
as a relic. A member complained that some one
had already sawn away a piece of the tree. Mr.
Mark Sykes, who is a geologist as well as a Town
Councillor, said the tree had been given to him
by the contractor and by the common consent
of the committee. Several members disputed
Mr. Sykes's claim, and the Town clerk said he
thought the tree was the property of the Corporation.
Another member said that if they
could not see out and allowed it to dry properly
they would have a most valuable piece of timber
with which to make the furniture for the proposed
new Town Hall. They would then possess
some of the most unique suites of furniture in
the kingdom. The Mayor said a gentleman
had written to him suggesting that the tree
should be sent to London and dried by the
electric process on the top of one of the buildings.
They must not be allowed to chop the tree
up. The chairman of the Sewage Committee
remarked that many people had already made
claims to the tree. Not satisfied with that they
had broken open the powder magazine, which
was said to contain powder but beer, and helped
themselves to the liquor. The committee would
do their best to preserve this tree if it could be
done with safety.

TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
Business here is still quiet. The past
fortnight, as is usual at this season, has
been very much of a holiday-time, occupied
in stocktaking, and the market, as a
matter of course, has shown little movement.
The indications of trade generally
throughout the country are of continued
activity, and there is a hopeful outlook
for the timber trade, in connection
with housebuilding requirements especially.
Shipbuilding is still hampered by
the dispute in the engineering trade, and
the shipbuilding demand for timber is to
some extent restricted. Present stocks of
teak and pitch pine are sufficient to meet
requirements for some time, but at the rate
of consumption experienced during the past
year would soon show a diminution, provided
supplies meantime are limited. Last year's consumption of pitch
pine for Clyde ports was 53,800 loads. The
imports amounted to 62,000 loads, and stock
at close of the year 34,700 loads. Teak imports
to Glasgow for the year were 8,378 loads logs
and 510 loads planks, and to Glasgow 5,669
loads logs and 2,952 loads planks. A total consumption of 13,738 loads logs
and planks for the year is indicated, the
stock at close showing a considerable increase
in logs as compared with the stock
at Dec. 31st, 1896.
The arrivals at Glasgow during the past
week have included the "Keen," (s),
from St. John, N.B., which landed a cargo
of about 9,000 spruce deals for Allison,
Cousland, & Co.; also Quebec deals and
ends, being some balances forwarded via St.
John, consigned to Allison, Cousland, &
Co., and F. A. Lightbody & Co.
United States hardwood imports are represented
by parcels per "Amaryathia" (s),
discharging at Queen's Dock, comprising
various consignments oak planks, &c. Last
year's imports of oak arriving weekly per
liners from the States amounted to 17,480
loads planks and boards, and 705 loads logs.
There were also arrivals of oak planks to a
considerable amount per liners from Quebec
and Montreal during the season.
The "Indralema" (s), from Newport News,
is due, and brings sundry parcels of walnut
logs and boards, canary whitewood &c.,
particulars of which will be given next
week. At the piling ground, Queen's Dock,
we notice that during the last few days
several consignments of African mahogany
logs—of direct imports via Liverpool—have
been stored by Cant & Kemp. This market
is at present quite bare of Honduras and
Tabasco mahogany; last auction was on the
21st ult., when the Honduras cargo, ex
"Fornjot," Allison, Cousland, & Co., brokers,
was all cleared, meeting with an eager
demand. There is good opening for further
imports.

LEITH.
There are the following arrivals to report
viz., 39,500 oak staves and 42 wainscot logs
per "Orient" (s), from Libau; 1,407 sawn
pitch pine logs and 376 deals, per "Killy,"
from Pensacola; 6 oak logs, 30 walnut logs,
80 poplar logs, and 18,475 oak staves, per
"Kildona " (s) from Newport News and
Norfolk. The cargo of pitch pine timber is
for Park, Dobson, & Co., and the other
arrivals are divided among various receivers.

INVERNESS.
Business is moving along fairly well this
week, the fine open weather being favourable
to outdoor work, and the deliveries of wood
from docks and yards are remarkably good
for the season of the year. The cargo of
Oregon pine timber and deals discharging, ex
"Arthur Fitger," from Port Blakely (Puget
Sound), is attracting general attention; this
wood has hitherto been very little used in
this district, and a large slow of sale in the
present one is likely to take a considerable time to distribute.
