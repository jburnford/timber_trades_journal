JANUARY 15, 1898.
ANNUAL CIRCULARS.
SINGLETON, DUNN, & CO.
While the consumption of all kinds of wood goods during 1897 has been large—in the aggregate larger than during the previous year—the results have not been so satisfactory.
The opening months of the year promised well, and in consequence buyers bought freely on contract for delivery during the season.
The production and shipment of all kinds of sawn lumber from America was, however, so much more than an average, and in excess of what was anticipated, that early in summer prices became weak, and in the face of continued large imports gradually fell till the close of the season.
There is now an unusually heavy stock, and, though the consumption is large, buyers, with perhaps the exception of shipbuilders, are well supplied, and till the surplus stock has been considerably reduced there seems slight prospect of any improvement in values.
The timber-consuming industries have been, generally speaking, very well employed during 1897, and using more than their usual supplies of wood goods, with the exception of the shipbuilding industry, on account of the prolonged strike in the engineering trade, has not taken up the quantity of timber that would have gone into use had there been no interruption with the work on hand.
The year just passed has shown a still further development of trade in sawn wood goods at the expense of log timber.
The continued high price of North of Europe deals and battens has also tended to increase the outlet for American spruce and red pine, which are now being manufactured into sizes that formerly were supplied from the North of Europe.
There is every prospect that during the year just entered on there will be a good consumption; but there is a very ample supply to draw from.
CANT & KEMP.
At the commencement of last year the general tone was firm and hopeful, and notwithstanding the unforeseen troubles that have so much hampered the shipbuilding industry, it has been justified.
As a whole, the turnover of timber has been large, and although the import is greater than for some years, prices, as a rule, have not fallen.
The annexed return of the stock of the principal items show a general increase, and merchants have rather to be congratulated on the fact that it is not greater, when the general dislocation of our principal industry is considered, and it is remembered that although it has now gone on for six months there is little immediate prospect of a settlement.
All shipbuilders' timber shows an increase in stock, sawn pitch pine having almost again attained a record position; whilst teak has acquired it.
Deals of all descriptions are more plentiful and prices have receded in consequence.
The increase in the importation of sidings from Canada is of importance, exercising, as it does, a mate-

rial influence on the deal trade.
During 1897, there was launched from Scotch shipbuilding yards about 341,000 tons, or about 89,000 tons less than the previous year, while the work in hand is estimated at nearly 390,000 tons, or about 90,000 tons more than at December, 1896.
It is gratifying to note that the building trade has been prosperous during the past year, and that in it, a healthy tone prevails.
Rolling stock manufacturers and cabinetmakers have been well employed, and have a fair amount of work in hand.
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
THE REMOVAL OF BLOWN TIMBER.
ACTIONS BY THE DUKE OF SUTHERLAND.
In the Court of Session Lord Kyllachy has issued judgment in two actions brought by the Duke of Sutherland against James Mackenzie, timber merchant, Poles, Dornoch.
In the first the complainer sought to interdict the respondent from cutting down trees between the Dunrobin Glen and the Doll, on the east, and the Dunrobin and Uppat Woods, in the parishes of Golspie and Clyne.
There was an alternative conclusion to the effect that the respondent should be interdicted from cutting down or removing from the woods mentioned any trees other than such as have been blown down or destroyed by wind.
By contract dated in February and March, 1894, the respondent acquired right to the trees in the Uppat Woods which had been blown down or destroyed by a severe gale shortly before.
The complainer averred that the respondent had not confined his operations to biown down trees, but had cut down a large number of trees, which had been only slightly damaged at the top, and others to some small extent injured, which had been carried out the contract, and had honestly carried out the contract, and had neither cut down nor removed damaged by squirrels or those
within the wood which in his Lordship's opinion the respondent was entitled to be allowed to cut down.
He interdicts the respondent from cutting down or removing under his orders any trees other than such as have been mentioned in the petition as blown down or destroyed by wind.
"Quoad ultra," his lordship dismisses the note, and finds the complainer entitled to expenses, subject to modification.
In the second action the Duke of Sutherland sued Mackenzie for £643 13s. 9d., of which £613 11s. 9d. was a balance said to be due for 16,000 trees removed under the contract and for trees illegally removed by him, but the pursuer, in respect of the missing of this action, was willing to deduct £140 off the sum sued for.
The defender, in reply, said he estimated he had a counter action against the pursuer for the use of two saw-mills, which was valued at at least £413 15s., but the true amount of which could not be adjusted till the accounts were furnished; and he maintained there was a balance amounting between them there was a balance due by him to the pursuer.
Lord Kyllachy, between whom the respective claims of £613 11s. 9d. and for 16,000 trees removed, finds there is a balance which his lordship counts at £140, the pursuer having moved for a corresponding and, as his lordship admitts, he finds that the pursuer's claim for £613 11s. 9d. is out in the different claims for and against the pursuer, and the extent of the trees which the respondent was not admitted to have been topped.
His lordship finds that on a just construction of the contract between the parties, the respondent was not entitled to cut down any trees within the woods mentioned other than trees which had been blown down or destroyed by the wind; and finds that in the summer and autumn of 1896 respondent cut down and appropriated in the wood known as the Uppat Wood a number of trees which had not been blown down or destroyed by the wind, but were in the summer and autumn of nearly three years after the gale of 1896 (being near the close of the contract) standing living and exhibiting no sign of decay; finds "in separatim" that the same after having in May and June, 1896, marked or caused to be marked
