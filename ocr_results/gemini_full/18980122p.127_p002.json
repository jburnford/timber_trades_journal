It appeared that the debtor [?] business at Barrow with a capital [?] he purchased £500 worth of stock, and [?] on credit. He became involved [?] with traders in Manchester, through [?] arrangements to draw bills, and [?] to draw bills on him. The Official [?] said before going thoroughly into this [?] examination he should want a detailed [?] account, with a full explanation of [?] transactions since he had been in busi[?]ness. The examination was eventually ordered [?] to be adjourned to enable debtor to file the [?] necessary accounts.\nJAMES HAWKES, dining table maker, [?] Street, Shoreditch.—The first [?] of creditors was held in this case on [?] at the London Bankruptcy Court, and [?] the accounts filed showing debts £189 11s. 7d., [?] with assets £10 10s.

She [?] attributed her insolvency to loss on the trading [?] for the last two years, partly through de[?]preciation in value, and partly through having [?] to sell goods with wet wood by one of the [?] creditors. The case went into bankruptcy, the [?] Official Receiver acting as trustee.\nJAMES THOMAS J. NICHOLS.—The adjourned public [?] examination of this debtor took place at the [?] Bankruptcy Court on Friday before the [?] Registrar, there being nothing further of importance [?] to be elicited, and the examination was eventu[?]ally closed.\nWORTH JAMES TURNER, [?] Street, Bradford, trading [?] as Turner and Hardy. The statement [?] of affairs issued under this failure [?] shows that the debtors' liabili[?]ties amount to £1,126 3s. 8d., and assets [?] £[?]. The claims of preferential credi[?]tors are returned at £1,126 3s. [?] and alleges their failure to have been [?] due to loss on contracts.\nJOSEPH [?], builder, Palmerston [?]—The receiving order in [?] was made in March last, and the [?] was adjourned to Mr. Registrar Hope [?] for his discharge. Proofs for [?] £[?] had been lodged. The failure was attributed [?] to bad debts, and no assets [?] were disclosed. It was building opera[?]tions. The application was opposed by the [?] Official Receiver on statutory grounds, and the [?] Court suspended the discharge for two [?] years.\nHENRY [?], builder, late Boscombe.
