FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BRECKETT, CHARLES ROGER, timber merchant, Hindpool Road, Barrow, trading as Beckett & Co., at 163 Piccadilly, Bradford, and as Forshaw & Co., at Manchester.—The public examination of this debtor was commenced at the Barrow Bankruptcy Court on Friday. It appeared that he commenced business at Barrow with a capital of £800. He purchased £500 worth of stock, and sold material on credit. He became involved with money lenders in Manchester, through whom he made arrangements to draw bills, and for them to draw bills on him. The Official Receiver said before going thoroughly into this debtor's examination he should want a detailed deficiency account, with a full explanation of his bill transactions since he had been in business. The examination was eventually ordered to be adjourned, to enable debtor to file the necessary accounts.
BLANKS, SUSAN, dining and coffee-table maker, 17 Rivington Street, Shoreditch.—The first meeting of creditors was held in this case on Tuesday, at the London Bankruptcy Court, and accounts were filed showing debts £189 11s. 7d., against assets £10 10s. Creditors:—
£ s. d.
Jones, C. J., Horton Street, N.E. .. .. 10 13 9
West, J., Mount Street, Bethnal Green .. 22 3 6
Brown, S. J., Leadenhall Street, E.C. .. 84 0 0
The debtor, on the death of her husband in November, 1891, continued the business by means of credit given by the timber merchants, who had previously supplied her husband. She attributed her insolvency to loss on the trading through the past two years, partly through depression in business, and partly through having one of the men supplied with wet wood by one of the creditors. The case went into bankruptcy, the Official Receiver acting as trustee.
CHIVERS, THOMAS, formerly of Bristol, builder, of Knowle.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor took place at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court on Friday last, before Mr. Registrar Metcalfe. He did not appear, but nothing further of importance transpired, and the examination was eventually ordered to be closed.
DUCKWORTH, JAMES THOMAS, of Bank, Barzoldswick, and SAMUEL SHAW, of 6, Essex Street, Bradford, trading as Duckworth & Shaw, builders, and contractors, at Bradford and Earby. The statement of affairs has now been issued under this failure, from which it appears that the debtors' liabilities amount to £1,126 9s. 3d., after deducting the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, are returned at £1,091 1s. 3d., and the assets £234 18s. 1d. The debtors allege their failure to be due to losses on contracts.
GOODE, JOSEPH, builder, late of Walthamstow.—The receiving order in this case was made in March last, and the debtor has now applied to Mr. Registrar Hope for an order of discharge. Proofs for £1,023 10s. 2d. have been lodged, and no assets have been realised. The failure was attributed to sustained on speculative building operations, and the application was opposed by the Official Receiver on statutory grounds, and the discharge was suspended the discharge for two years.
LEGG, HENRY, builder, late of Boscombe, Bournemouth.—The adjourned public examination of this bankrupt took place at the Poole Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Dickinson, on the 11th inst. Replying to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he had not yet made arrangements to pay 10s. in the £, and he could not tell whether there was any chance of that amount being paid. The Registrar said he could not understand the statement of affairs filed by the debtor, which showed an excess of assets over liabilities. The debtor stated that there would be a surplus if the properties were realised at a figure commensurate with their value. The Official Receiver said that before the debtor's examination was closed, he should like him to be ordered to file a proper statement of affairs. Debtor said he could not make out a better one. The Registrar said that before the examination was closed the debtor would have to file the necessary statement.
MADDOCKS, THOMAS, builder, Newcastle-under-Lyme.—An application was made, at the Hanley Bankruptcy Court, last week, before his Honour Judge Jordan, for the discharge of the above-named bankrupt. It appeared from the Official Receiver's report that the receiving order was made on January 18th, 1897, on the debtor's own petition. He filed a statement of affairs under the proceedings, showing liabilities expected to rank for dividend amounting to £984 8s. 6d., but the proofs admitted amounted to £1,115 8s. 7d. The Official Receiver pointed out that the bankrupt's assets were not of a value equal to 10s. in the pound, and that he omitted to keep proper books of account. His Honour granted the bankrupt an immediate order of discharge, provided judgment was entered against him for £10, to augment the dividend paid to the unsecured creditors. He also granted a certificate to the effect that the bankruptcy had been brought about by misfortune, and not by any misconduct on the part of the debtor.
METCALFE, HENRY, builder, Stanbury.—The public examination of this debtor took place at the Bradford Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar, last week. In reply to questions, he stated that until February last he was in a situation. He then began business in partnership with Mr. William Tallentire, as builders, at Tallentire. The capital of the firm was £50, of which debtor contributed £30, and the remaining £20 was found by Mr. Tallentire. In July last Mr. Tallentire took a quarry without witness's knowledge, and owing to a disagreement in respect of the matter they made an arrangement whereby debtor was to retire from the firm and receive £70. He signed a document at the time, which he took to be a deed of dissolution of partnership, but he now believed it to have been a transfer of the property subject to mortgage. Mr. Tallentire left the district in October last. The building society eventually sold the property, and as a result there was a surplus of £300, over and above the amount of the mortgage. Eventually the examination was ordered to be closed.
PHAROAH, HENRY CHAMBERLAIN, builder, Gencoe, Gleneldon Road, Streatham, Surrey, and carrying on business at Cedars Road, Beckenham, Kent.—The Official Receiver, in his observations herein, states that the receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition. An order for adjudication has been made. No statement of accounts has been lodged, but it would appear that his unsecured liabilities amount to about £900. The assets are stated to consist of the balance, about £800, of a deposit on certain furniture which the debtor was about to purchase under a hiring agreement, the balance due on the sale of fourteen leasehold houses at Beckenham, which the debtor estimates should be at least £275, after deducting the mortgagee's claims; and the debtor's reversionary interest under his father's will, which is stated to be charged for £1,000.

WILLIAMS, JAMES, builder and contractor, New Lane, Laisterdyke, Bradford.—The above-named bankrupt appeared for his public examination before the Registrar at the last sitting of the Bradford Bankruptcy Court. In answer to questions, the debtor stated that until February 1891, he was a builder's manager. He then, with a capital of £40, commenced business on his own account, and did fairly well until the end of 1896, when he entered into a contract for the erection of some tin-plate works at Thornbury. He had sent in a tender for £820, but he afterwards found that he had made an error in his calculation, and in addition to that, the price of materials went up from 20s. to 30 per cent. The debtor was allowed to pass his examination.
WILTSHIRE, JAMES, Kingswood.—The public examination of this debtor was held on Friday at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court, and after the debtor had been briefly questioned with regard to his accounts was adjourned until February.
