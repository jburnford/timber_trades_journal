TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
A fair amount of business has been done during the past week, and deliveries to consumers are at a satisfactory rate. An arrival recently referred to, consisting of parcels of deals and U.S. hardwoods per regular liners, have to a considerable amount been taken up by buyers ex quay. The further arrivals since last writing have been light; they comprise a consignment of Quebec pine deals, 1st, 3rd, and 4th qualities, for Edmiston & Mitchells, per “Sarmatian” (s), from Portland, Me., and some lots of teak planks landed at Prince’s Dock ex “Prome” (s), the consignees being Jas. Kennedy & Co., Cant & Kemp, and Edmiston & Mitchells. Teak planks are moderate in stock, and the imports above referred to are meeting a good demand. Last year’s consumption of teak planks was upwards of 3,000 loads. The stock in public depots at close of the year including part held by consumers was about 600 loads. There have been no public sales by timber brokers to report since the year opened, and apparently none will be held this month; but it will be observed that Cant & Kemp announce a sale of mahogany and various other woods to take place at Queen’s Dock, Glasgow, on February 1st, and Edmiston & Mitchells a similar sale of Quebec and Lower Port pine and spruce deals, &c., at Yorkhill on February 2nd.
In connection with railway extension a large amount of ground is about to be taken up for new lines of rails. As matters are the accommodation for logs at Queen’s Dock has been inadequate, and the approaches occasionally blocked by railway waggons.
Something would require to be done to provide suitable space there to which the timber trade would have a right for storage of logs, and those who have to do with storing timber would then be relieved from the unpleasantness of having to crave from the harbour master, as they are frequently compelled to do from want of room, permission to pile logs here and there on spaces to which the timber trade is apparently considered to have no claim.
With regard to business for next season, we hear of some considerable contracts having been fixed for Lower Port spruce. A large consumption of American spruce took place here last year, and, with North of Europe wood dearer, there is likely to be a continued good trade in American deals. Of N.B. and N.S. deals, chiefly spruce, the imports last year to Clyde (Glasgow, Greenock, and Bowling) were about 20,000 St. Petersburg standards.
The consumption did not quite keep pace, the stock at close of the year being about 3,000 standards more than at December 31st, 1896, but shows a large demand, especially considering that spruce deals from Quebec and other St. Lawrence ports were also so largely imported.
GREENOCK.
The only arrival at this port since the year began is the “Janotan” from Demerara, with a cargo of 245 greenheart logs consigned to Duncan, Ewing, & Co., Liverpool.

LEITH.
There are practically no arrivals of wood to report this week. In the meantime, with the continuance of fine, open weather, work has been well maintained, and deliveries from stocks are on a liberal scale. The prospects of building work for the current year are fairly good, and now that the engineers have withdrawn their demand for an ‘eight hours’ day,’ it is fully expected that an early resumption of work will be arranged for. This will certainly have a favourable influence upon the trade generally, and not least upon the timber trade.
Higher freights are being asked from the Baltic and White Sea than were current for open water last year; but, although in some cases these advanced rates have been actually paid, it is too soon to assume that they will be maintained, and importers would be well advised to be in no hurry to charter unless they can secure tonnage on the basis of last spring rates.
