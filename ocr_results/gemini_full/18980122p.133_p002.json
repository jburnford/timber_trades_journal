Kinipple to the Institution of Civil Engineers, the author pointed out that the natural facilities of the port of Greenock were first utilised about the year 1640, when a dry stone pier was built to serve as a landing place for fishing and coasting craft, and for vessels trading to Ireland.\nIn 1696 a Customs official deputed by Cromwell reported favourably on the harbour of Greenock and its probable advance in foreign trade.\nThe advance involved increased accommodation, which was made in 1696, gardeners from Edinburgh doing the excavation, as they were considered the most suitable workmen.\nThe cost was £5,555.\nThe first graving-dock, 220 ft. long, was made by James Watt in 1785, and cost £4,000.\nIt is still used for small vessels.\nThe repairs having been made in 1884.\nThe East India Harbour, commenced in 1805 by John Rennie, cost £43,000, and the second graving-dock, of 356 ft. long, made in 1818, cost £20,000.\nThe pier is given as of 10 1/2 acres, and while Princes Pier cost about £100,000, was given of recent works, more particularly of the Graving Dock, 635 ft. long; the James Watt Dock, and the Western Tidal Harbour.\n\nOBITUARY.\nOur readers will learn with regret of the demise of Mr. Thomas Jamieson, joiner, builder, and valuator, in Greenock, which took place on the 10th inst., at the comparatively early age of 59 years.\nDeceased had only been laid aside for about a fortnight with cold, which latterly developed into pneumonia, resulting in death.\nHe leaves a widow and seven of a family to mourn his loss.\nAfter serving his apprenticeship to the joiner trade under Mr. James Black, of that town, Mr. Jamieson served a year and a-half in the office of Messrs. Peddie & Kinnard, architects, Edinburgh, where he acquired a knowledge of architectural work and plans, which did him in good service in his profession.\nHis services were also much in request as a property valuator and surveyor.\nThe interment took place on Thursday, the 13th inst., in the Greenock cemetery, and the funeral was largely attended.\n\nTHE\nNEW SWEDISH CONTRACT FORM,\nthe terms of which were approved by the Swedish Saw-mill Owners' Society.\nPRICE 3s. PER DOZEN.\nWILLIAM RIDER & SON, LIMITED,\n14, BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE, LONDON, E.C.",
