NEW CHURCH AT GLASGOW.
The new Roman Catholic Church, dedicated to St. Patrick's, was opened on the 2nd inst.
The church is situated at the corner of North Street and William Street, Anderston, Glasgow, and is a picturesque building.
It is designed in the early decorated style.
The nave is divided into seven bays, is 102 ft. long, 30 ft. wide, and, including aisles, the total width is 59 ft.
The clerestory is supported by three arches of a span of 27 ft.
These arches are supported by granite columns, so that two columns practically support the weight of the clerestory on either side.
The effect of these bold arches is very fine.
In each of the seven bays of clerestory is a five-light window with traceried head, and in bays of aisle, on the epistle side, are two two-light windows with traceried heads.
A splendid flood of light comes in from the great west window, which is divided into seven lights, with richly traceried head, and is 32 ft. high.
The baptistery is placed at the end of the aisle on the gospel side and is lit by a three-light traceried window, and the confessionals are in recesses in the aisle on gospel side.
The chancel is divided from nave by a chancel arch and terminates with a five-sided apse, in each bay of which is a two-light window with traceried head.
The side chapels are divided from chancel by an arch, over which are two two-light windows with traceried heads, throwing a good light on altar.
Each chapel is lit by a rose window.
Ample provision has been made for entrance and exit.
There are two doors under great west window, approached by a flight of eight steps from North Street, and another at the end of aisle, approached from William Street.
An exit door has been put at the chancel end of aisle on the epistle side, leading into William Street.
The organ gallery at the west end is reached by a circular stone staircase.
The roof, supported by six principals, has a total height, from floor to ridge, of 67 feet, but is ceiled internally at a height of 57 feet.
The internal length of church is 134 feet.
Accommodation is provided for over 1,000 worshippers.
There is ample sacristy accommodation.
The presbytery, which has just been completed, is connected to the church by a corridor from the sacristy.
The church and presbytery are built of Locherbriggs stone, the roofs covered with slates from the Aberfoyle quarries.
The church has been erected at a cost of £9,000.
Both church and presbytery are lit by electric light.
The whole has been designed and carried out under the direction of Messrs. Pugin & Pugin, of London.

GREENOCK HARBOUR.
In a paper recently read by Mr. W. R. Kinipple to the Institution of Civil Engineers, the author pointed out that the natural facilities of the port of Greenock were first utilised about the year 1640, when a dry stone pier was built to serve as a landing place for fishing and coasting craft, and for vessels trading to Ireland.
In 1696 a Customs official deputed by Cromwell reported favourably on the harbour of Greenock and its probable advance in foreign trade.
The advance involved increased accommodation, which was made in 1696, gardeners from Edinburgh doing the excavation, as they were considered the most suitable workmen.
The cost was £5,555.
The first graving-dock, 220 ft. long, was made by James Watt in 1785, and cost £4,000.
It is still used for small vessels.
The repairs having been made in 1884.
The East India Harbour, commenced in 1805 by John Rennie, cost £43,000, and the second graving-dock, of 356 ft. long, made in 1818, cost £20,000.
The pier is given as of 10 1/2 acres, and while Princes Pier cost about £100,000, was given of recent works, more particularly of the Graving Dock, 635 ft. long; the James Watt Dock, and the Western Tidal Harbour.

OBITUARY.
Our readers will learn with regret of the demise of Mr. Thomas Jamieson, joiner, builder, and valuator, in Greenock, which took place on the 10th inst., at the comparatively early age of 59 years.
Deceased had only been laid aside for about a fortnight with cold, which latterly developed into pneumonia, resulting in death.
He leaves a widow and seven of a family to mourn his loss.
After serving his apprenticeship to the joiner trade under Mr. James Black, of that town, Mr. Jamieson served a year and a-half in the office of Messrs. Peddie & Kinnard, architects, Edinburgh, where he acquired a knowledge of architectural work and plans, which did him in good service in his profession.
His services were also much in request as a property valuator and surveyor.
The interment took place on Thursday, the 13th inst., in the Greenock cemetery, and the funeral was largely attended.
