The fine open weather has permitted of building work going forward without interruption, and the prospect of the house-building trade is an evidence of growth and prosperity in the general community so long that, though brisk on the whole, it can be shown that, though the number has not increased, the rate at which building has been going on, or not unduly so. The records of the City Assessor are valuable in showing from year to year the rate at which property is being added to and the proportion that the rental bears to that of the whole. Of late years, during which there has been active building going on, it is satisfactory to find that the rental has been increasing, and it is anticipated that the demand for house-property during the current year will be active.\nThe shipbuilding and engineer trade is also in a flourishing condition, and from the large amount of work on hand and in this connection are very substantial.\nBusiness during the week has been a quiet one, and we do not hear of much\n\nROBERT HAMILTON & CO.\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n75, ST.

Allison, Cousland, & Co. have a timber sale announced to be held at Greenock.\nLEITH.\nThe arrivals this week consist of 2,750 oak staves, per “Croft” (s), from New York, 2,164 logs sawn pitch pine and 260 deals, per “Lizzie Ross,” from Darien, and 7,120 deals, per “Nora” (s), from Vardo. There seems to be some mystery about the pitch pine cargo, and it is reported to be a consignment or market cargo, but particulars have not yet transpired. The shipment per “Nora” (s), is for Mr. D. W. Beattie, and consists of a cargo of White Sea deals, which, owing to an accident to the vessel that loaded the goods, were discharged at Vardo, and have now been forwarded from that port to their destination.\n\nJAMES KENNEDY & CO.,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchants,\n69, BUCHANAN STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"LIGNUM, GLASGOW.\"\n\nLOVE & STEWART,\nPitwood Importers & Coal Exporters,\n140, HOPE STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address— | Telephone No.\n\"LOVARAT.\" | 3081\n\nBUCHANAN & FRENCH,\nTimber Importers, Merchants and Saw-millers,\nAlbert Saw-mills, RENFREW,\nAnd 82, St. Enoch Square, GLASGOW\nTelegraphic Address: \"WAINSCOT,\"\nGLASGOW & RENFREW.
