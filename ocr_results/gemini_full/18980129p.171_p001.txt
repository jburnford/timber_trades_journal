TRADE REPORTS.

GLASGOW.
Deliveries here continue at a steady rate, and saw-mills are well supplied with orders, and have been kept in active employment. The fine open weather has permitted of building work going forward without interruption, and the prospect of the house-building trade is an evidence of growth and prosperity in the general community so long that, though brisk on the whole, it can be shown that, though the number has not increased, the rate at which building has been going on, or not unduly so. The records of the City Assessor are valuable in showing from year to year the rate at which property is being added to and the proportion that the rental bears to that of the whole. Of late years, during which there has been active building going on, it is satisfactory to find that the rental has been increasing, and it is anticipated that the demand for house-property during the current year will be active.
The shipbuilding and engineer trade is also in a flourishing condition, and from the large amount of work on hand and in this connection are very substantial.
Business during the week has been a quiet one, and we do not hear of much

business being done for next season yet, merchants being apparently cautious in making their purchases.
The only arrival is the “Orthia” from Baltimore, her general cargo including various consignments of oak, walnut, canary, whitewood, hickory, &c., which have been landed at Prince’s Dock.
There are several auction sales forthcoming, which, as the opening ones of the year, will be of special interest.
On Tuesday next, 1st February, at Queen’s Dock, Glasgow, Cant & Kemp hold their sale of mahogany and various other woods as advertised.
This auction occurs at a favourable time, as rather a long interval has passed since last imports of mahogany to this market, and demand is likely to be good.
On February 2nd a sale of deals, &c., by Edmiston & Mitchells is to take place at Yorkhill, and for 10th inst. Allison, Cousland, & Co. have a timber sale announced to be held at Greenock.
LEITH.
The arrivals this week consist of 2,750 oak staves, per “Croft” (s), from New York, 2,164 logs sawn pitch pine and 260 deals, per “Lizzie Ross,” from Darien, and 7,120 deals, per “Nora” (s), from Vardo. There seems to be some mystery about the pitch pine cargo, and it is reported to be a consignment or market cargo, but particulars have not yet transpired. The shipment per “Nora” (s), is for Mr. D. W. Beattie, and consists of a cargo of White Sea deals, which, owing to an accident to the vessel that loaded the goods, were discharged at Vardo, and have now been forwarded from that port to their destination.
