Powis Bale, C.E., M.I.M.E.\nTimber Trade Miscellanea—Woods and their -Uses—List of Woods commonly used in Great Britain—London Price List for Sawing—Timber and Saw-mill Trade Technical Terms, &c.\nWILLIAM RIDER & SON, LIMITED,\nTimber Trades Journal Office, 14, Bartholomew Close, London, E.C.\n\nAUSTRALIAN FORESTRY.\nThe increasing use of Australian timbers for wood - paving purposes has naturally directed attention to capabilities of the various colonies as permanent sources of supply, the general impression being that in this respect Western Australia takes the lead.\nThis, however, is an erroneous assump-tion, for, according to Mr. Coghlan, the New South Wales Government Statistician, the Australian mother colony possesses a wealth of timber surpassed by only a few other countries.\nIts woods are varied as they are valuable, ranging from the iron-barks, unsurpassed for work requiring hardness and durability, to the kinds suit-able for the most delicate specimens of the cabinet-maker's art.\nIndiscriminate felling has, however, made several kinds compara-tively rare, a frequent experience in newly settled countries, where the leading object of the pioneer residents is almost invariably to get rid of the timber on the lands occupied by them.\nThe necessity of preserving the timber resources of the colony, and preventing the ruthless destruction of the best species of brush and hardwood which was being carried on, principally in the Clarence River district and in the eucalyptus forests on the Murray, led the Government, in 1871, to establish a certain number of forest reserves throughout the colony, in which permission to cut timber, under certain conditions, should be granted upon payment of a fixed fee.\nSub-sequently, in 1875, the office of Forest Ranger was created, and this led to the for-mation in March, 1882, of a Forest Conserva-tion Branch, which was attached to the Department of Mines.\nSeven years later the colony was subdivided into a number of forest districts.\nThese are frequently in-spected by forest rangers, whose duty it is to report on the existing state of the proclaimed reserves, control the operations of licensed timber-getters, receive royalties on the various kinds of timber upon which such dues may be levied, and report upon applica-tions to ringbark trees on Crown lands, whether comprised in forest reserves or otherwise.\nIn view of the importance of the timber resources of the colony, the Hon. J. H. Carruthers, Minister for Lands, is pre-paring a Bill, the main feature of which will be the establishment of permanent forestry reserves, where the timber can not only be used as it matures, but where steps can be taken to create a new supply to take the place of the trees which may be felled.\nThis feature of the establishment of permanent reserves is, the Minister says, the chief matter to be considered, and it will apply mainly to the coastal forests, to the red gum forests on the Murray, and to the ironbark forests all over the colony.\nWith regard to the pine forests, it is recognised that a different system will have to be adopted, because pine is a timber of rapid growth, and, indeed, in many instances it is nothing more nor less than a noxious weed.\nIn the meantime much has already been effected in the direction indicated.\nDuring the last two years about 60,000 acres of red gum, 30,000 acres of pine, and 2,000 acres of coastal forests have been improved by thinning out and destroying the superabundant growths.\nThis work has been carried out with the object of ensuring the maturity of a larger number of trees to the acre, and, by reason of the additional light and air afforded, of their reaching that stage in about two-thirds of the time that would be taken under natural conditions.\nThe cost of the thinning out operations averages 3s. 8d. per acre in the red gum areas, 4s. 6d. in the pine areas, and 7s. in the coastal areas; and it is esti-mated that this outlay will return during the next twenty years two or three hundred marketable trees to the acre where the present unimproved average is but four or five.\nThe Forest Conservation branch is charged with the direction of a State forest nursery, which is situated at Gosford, in the beautiful district of Brisbane Water, about 50 miles from Sydney, where the acclimatisation of valuable foreign timber trees, and the con-servation of such of the best indigenous species as might otherwise be likely to dis-appear, are attended to.\nThe area set apart for the nursery is 65 acres, of which 25 acres are cleared and cultivated.\nAmong the indigenous trees which are raised, among which may be mentioned tallow-wood, blackbutt, beefwood, silky oak, yellow pine, the red varieties of ironbark, and red cedar, the red cedar seedlings on hand at the close of 1896 numbering about 32,000.\nOf late special attention has been paid to the cultivation of the white mulberry, the demand for this tree in consequence of the increased interest taken in the cultivation of silk in the colony.\nIt is estimated that there are 28,000 mulberry trees of different varieties, in various stages of growth, in the nursery, besides nearly 100,000 open-rooted.\nThe economic value of wattle-bark is very great in this colony, where it is in large demand for tanning purposes.\nDuring 1896, 80,770 cwt. of wattle-bark were imported, valued at £19,634, nearly all of this supply being obtained from Tasmania.\nIt will thus be readily seen that there is room for a large development of the trade in New South Wales.\nThe department has taken steps to prevent the indiscriminate stripping of the bark, and the destruction of the trees, and thus stimulate the trade.\n\nMUNICIPAL NOTES.\nBANFFSHIRE.—At the last meeting of the Upper District Committee of the C.C., a report was submitted by Mr. Scott, road surveyor to the Aberdeen District Committee, on the state of the road from Ballindalloch Station to Glenlivet Distillery.\nThe bad state of the road was caused by the heavy traction-engine traffic.\nIt was estimated that £1,850 would be required to put the road into a satisfactory state.\nThe report, which was adopted, recommended that this amount be spread over three years, and that a steam road-roller be purchased.\nKILMARNOCK.—The final award by Mr. Sale, Glasgow, as arbiter in the waterworks reference, allows the contractor £905 8s. additional to the measurements as at De-cember 25th last, and at the completion of the contract those allowed by the engineer, the extra prices granted over and above the contract being an addition of about £200 to what the contractor is entitled to at present on the work already done.\nThe arbiter finds the Corporation liable to the contractor in one-half of the expenses incurred by him in the reference; and to the clerk and assessor in the whole of his professional fees and charges, together with the amount of his outlays and disbursements.\nThe total amount claimed by the contractor was £8,500.\nELGIN.—The question of contributing to the erection of a bridge over the Spey at Blacksboat has been remitted to a Sub-Committee of the County Road Board to go over the plans and report.\nA report as to the alterations on roads and bridges by the doubling of the Great North line from Keith to Elgin has been submitted by the surveyor, and his recommendations, which were mainly as to fencing and easing gradients, approved of.\nIn regard to a siding for Mortlach Distillery, it has been agreed to remit back the application to the railway company to see if they could not put the line under a bridge.\n\nCAMERON BROS.,\nTIMBER IMPORTERS AND SAW-MILLERS,\nPERTH SAW-MILLS, PERTH.\nBRANCH YARD AT NEWBURGH.\nTelegraphic Address—\"BROTHERS, PERTH.\"\n\nA. & W.
