LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY.
In the Second Division of the Court of Session, Edinburgh, on Saturday, the Lord Justice Clerk and a jury tried an action, in which Andrew Adams, labourer, 18, Lily-bank Road, Dundee, sued Peter McGregor, timber merchant, of Kirkintilloch, for the sum of £150 as damages for the loss of two fingers of his left hand, which were cut off by a circular saw belonging to the defendant.
It appeared that the defendant, some time ago, erected a saw mill at Lumley Den, by Tealing, Forfar, for the purpose of sawing trees which had been cut down.
The plaintiff was employed at this work.
On August 23rd, 1897, when in the act of stepping on a plank used as a footway from one end of the saw to the other, the plank rose up, and the plaintiff, to save himself from falling bodily on the saw, put out his hands, with the result that the two centre fingers of his left hand were torn off.
Fault was attributed to the defendant on the ground that the footway or platform was defective in so far as it consisted of only one plank laid across some joists or coup-lings, whereas it ought to have consisted of two or more planks nailed to the joists.
On behalf of the defendant it was contended that the plaintiff was not in his employ, but by the contractor for the timber, and that the platform was of the usual kind employed in such work.
Even-tually the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and an unanimous was entered accordingly.

AMERICAN LUMBER IN PALESTINE.
The three articles of largest importation into Palestine are cotten goods, petroleum, and wood or timber.
The wood now to be obtained in the native markets is of decidedly inferior qualities.
Within the past year an enterprising firm in Jerusalem imported two small shipments of yellow pine from the United States.
This wood has commanded a very good price, and, what is still better, has been universally admired.
Lumber in the form of doors and window frames would also find a ready sale, for the domestic products are crude and very ex-pensive.
The sole question to be determined is as to price, and the only way to answer this would be for some enterprising firm to send a sample shipment to some reliable dealer in these goods.

AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY.
The increasing use of Australian timbers for wood - paving purposes has naturally directed attention to capabilities of the various colonies as permanent sources of supply, the general impression being that in this respect Western Australia takes the lead.
This, however, is an erroneous assump-tion, for, according to Mr. Coghlan, the New South Wales Government Statistician, the Australian mother colony possesses a wealth of timber surpassed by only a few other countries.
Its woods are varied as they are valuable, ranging from the iron-barks, unsurpassed for work requiring hardness and durability, to the kinds suit-able for the most delicate specimens of the cabinet-maker's art.
Indiscriminate felling has, however, made several kinds compara-tively rare, a frequent experience in newly settled countries, where the leading object of the pioneer residents is almost invariably to get rid of the timber on the lands occupied by them.
The necessity of preserving the timber resources of the colony, and preventing the ruthless destruction of the best species of brush and hardwood which was being carried on, principally in the Clarence River district and in the eucalyptus forests on the Murray, led the Government, in 1871, to establish a certain number of forest reserves throughout the colony, in which permission to cut timber, under certain conditions, should be granted upon payment of a fixed fee.
Sub-sequently, in 1875, the office of Forest Ranger was created, and this led to the for-mation in March, 1882, of a Forest Conserva-tion Branch, which was attached to the Department of Mines.
Seven years later the colony was subdivided into a number of forest districts.
These are frequently in-spected by forest rangers, whose duty it is to report on the existing state of the proclaimed reserves, control the operations of licensed timber-getters, receive royalties on the various kinds of timber upon which such dues may be levied, and report upon applica-tions to ringbark trees on Crown lands, whether comprised in forest reserves or otherwise.
In view of the importance of the timber resources of the colony, the Hon. J. H. Carruthers, Minister for Lands, is pre-paring a Bill, the main feature of which will be the establishment of permanent forestry reserves, where the timber can not only be used as it matures, but where steps can be taken to create a new supply to take the place of the trees which may be felled.
This feature of the establishment of permanent reserves is, the Minister says, the chief matter to be considered, and it will apply mainly to the coastal forests, to the red gum forests on the Murray, and to the ironbark forests all over the colony.
With regard to the pine forests, it is recognised that a different system will have to be adopted, because pine is a timber of rapid growth, and, indeed, in many instances it is nothing more nor less than a noxious weed.
In the meantime much has already been effected in the direction indicated.
During the last two years about 60,000 acres of red gum, 30,000 acres of pine, and 2,000 acres of coastal forests have been improved by thinning out and destroying the superabundant growths.
This work has been carried out with the object of ensuring the maturity of a larger number of trees to the acre, and, by reason of the additional light and air afforded, of their reaching that stage in about two-thirds of the time that would be taken under natural conditions.
The cost of the thinning out operations averages 3s. 8d. per acre in the red gum areas, 4s. 6d. in the pine areas, and 7s. in the coastal areas; and it is esti-mated that this outlay will return during the next twenty years two or three hundred marketable trees to the acre where the present unimproved average is but four or five.
The Forest Conservation branch is charged with the direction of a State forest nursery, which is situated at Gosford, in the beautiful district of Brisbane Water, about 50 miles from Sydney, where the acclimatisation of valuable foreign timber trees, and the con-servation of such of the best indigenous species as might otherwise be likely to dis-appear, are attended to.
The area set apart for the nursery is 65 acres, of which 25 acres are cleared and cultivated.
Among the indigenous trees which are raised, among which may be mentioned tallow-wood, blackbutt, beefwood, silky oak, yellow pine, the red varieties of ironbark, and red cedar, the red cedar seedlings on hand at the close of 1896 numbering about 32,000.
Of late special attention has been paid to the cultivation of the white mulberry, the demand for this tree in consequence of the increased interest taken in the cultivation of silk in the colony.
It is estimated that there are 28,000 mulberry trees of different varieties, in various stages of growth, in the nursery, besides nearly 100,000 open-rooted.
The economic value of wattle-bark is very great in this colony, where it is in large demand for tanning purposes.
During 1896, 80,770 cwt. of wattle-bark were imported, valued at £19,634, nearly all of this supply being obtained from Tasmania.
It will thus be readily seen that there is room for a large development of the trade in New South Wales.
The department has taken steps to prevent the indiscriminate stripping of the bark, and the destruction of the trees, and thus stimulate the trade.

MUNICIPAL NOTES.
BANFFSHIRE.—At the last meeting of the Upper District Committee of the C.C., a report was submitted by Mr. Scott, road surveyor to the Aberdeen District Committee, on the state of the road from Ballindalloch Station to Glenlivet Distillery.
The bad state of the road was caused by the heavy traction-engine traffic.
It was estimated that £1,850 would be required to put the road into a satisfactory state.
The report, which was adopted, recommended that this amount be spread over three years, and that a steam road-roller be purchased.
KILMARNOCK.—The final award by Mr. Sale, Glasgow, as arbiter in the waterworks reference, allows the contractor £905 8s. additional to the measurements as at De-cember 25th last, and at the completion of the contract those allowed by the engineer, the extra prices granted over and above the contract being an addition of about £200 to what the contractor is entitled to at present on the work already done.
The arbiter finds the Corporation liable to the contractor in one-half of the expenses incurred by him in the reference; and to the clerk and assessor in the whole of his professional fees and charges, together with the amount of his outlays and disbursements.
The total amount claimed by the contractor was £8,500.
ELGIN.—The question of contributing to the erection of a bridge over the Spey at Blacksboat has been remitted to a Sub-Committee of the County Road Board to go over the plans and report.
A report as to the alterations on roads and bridges by the doubling of the Great North line from Keith to Elgin has been submitted by the surveyor, and his recommendations, which were mainly as to fencing and easing gradients, approved of.
In regard to a siding for Mortlach Distillery, it has been agreed to remit back the application to the railway company to see if they could not put the line under a bridge.
