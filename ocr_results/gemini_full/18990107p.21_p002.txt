FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

DEE, HENRY, builder, Walton-on-Thames.
-The sitting for the adjourned public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Kingston-on-Thames Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday, before Mr. Deputy-Registrar Bell. The accounts filed disclose gross liabilities £5,758 0s. 8d., of which £2,825 19s. 1d. is expected to rank for dividend, and assets estimated to produce £143 15s. 4d. The failure was alleged by the debtor to be "Loss on contracts, speculative building, alteration and improvements, bad debts, want of premises, and ill-health." The Bankrupt failed to attend, but it was stated a telegram had been received from him stating that he was too ill to make the journey. Mr. Britten, assistant Official Receiver, explained that he should have to apply for an adjournment, as the bankrupt had failed to comply with an order served upon him by the Official Receiver for accounts. A solicitor appearing on behalf of creditors stated that he could not oppose an adjournment under the circumstances, and the Deputy Registrar adjourned the examination until the 31st inst., and made an order that the plaintiff should furnish the accounts required by the Official Receiver within ten days.

HARRIS, WILLIAM GEORGE, joiner & wheelwright, formerly of Ipplepen, now at Charlotte Street, Devonport.-The first meeting of the creditors concerned in this failure was held at the Official Receiver's offices, Plymouth, on Friday.

furniture was left at Ipplepen, near Newton Abbot, and was seized and sold by the sheriff's officer, under an execution. When he commenced business as an inventor he had no capital of his own to speak of, but had been financed by various gentlemen, for the purpose of developing and completing his inventions, which related principally to improvements in propelling cycles. He invented an improved driving gear for cycles, and a company was formed with a capital of £120,000 to develop it. The company did not go with the public, however, it was brought out too late in the season. He had invented a rotary engine for steam launches, an automatic shutter for pneumatic cycles, a micrometer hair adjustment, a double action horse clipper, and a fruit collector.
The Official Receiver: I wish it had been a better money collector for you.
The estate was eventually left in the hands of the Official Receiver.
