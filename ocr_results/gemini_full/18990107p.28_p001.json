The arrivals this week are extremely limited, and there is nothing to hand of special note.\nStocks of deals at Glasgow have now been made up as at 31st ult., and particulars are appended:—\n\nQuebec 1st Pine Deals - Pcs. 138,830 C. ft. 357,492\n\" 2nd \" \" - 55,104 130,266\n\" 3rd \" \" - 254,947 676,776\n\" 4th \" \" - 164,559 489,648\n\" 1st Pine Ends - 175,980 140,333\n\" 2nd \" \" - 38,952 22,352\n\" 3rd \" \" - 13,808 15,052\n\" 4th \" \" - 4,555 6,117\n\" Pine Planks & Boards 181,268 204,791\n\" Red Pine Deals - 44,124 88,804\nSpruce Deals - 332,620 424,336\n\" Boards - 28,294 18,662\nLower Port Spruce Deals 399,042 893,005\n\" \" Planks and Boards 40,502 31,880\n\" \" Pine Deals 89,270 239,725\n\nCompared with the stock of previous quarter, 30th September, there is a considerable reduction in all items, excepting red pine, the import of which was on a large scale during the last weeks of the Quebec season, than it had been in earlier months; the stock, however, is smaller than it has been for several years. Taken altogether the stocks are nearly 2,000 standards heavier than a year ago.\n\nRobert Hamilton & Co.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n75, ST.

One feature is the large increase in import and consumption of Lower Port spruce deals and battens. During 1898 the import was about 5,000 standards over previous year, and the consumption nearly 8,000 standards larger, while the stock at present is lighter than it was at 31st December, 1897.\n\nLEITH.\nThere are a few additional arrivals to report since last writing, which really all belong to the old year, although in the case of the last item on the list, same will be reckoned to the credit of the new year, ship having only entered the dock on 2nd inst. The arrivals referred to consist of 28,792 deal and batten ends, and 3,636 pieces lathwood per s.s. \"Calabria,\" from Riga; 676 bundles and 1,184 pieces poplar per s.s. \"Prodano,\" from Baltimore; 7,759 deals and battens per the \"Johanna,\" from Skien.\nThe s.s. \"Calabria\" had a very rough passage from Riga, and cargo is being landed in a damaged condition, the deal and batten ends being covered with sodden linseed, and presenting a most extraordinary appearance piled on the quay.\nThere has been little or nothing doing this week in the way of sending away orders, but now that the holidays are over a fresh start will be made.\nSome of the shippers' representatives have been here during the week, and I understand that a quantity of Gromoff goods has been placed for f.o.w. St. Petersburg here and elsewhere at good prices.\n\nJAMES KENNEDY & Co.,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchants,\n69, BUCHANAN STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\n\"LIGNUM, GLASGOW.\"\n\nLOVE & STEWART, LIMITED.\nPitwood Importers & Coal Exporters,\n140, HOPE STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\n\"LOVART,\" Telephone No. 3081.\n\nBUCHANAN & FRENCH,\nTimber Importers, Merchants and Saw-millers,\nAlbert Saw mills, RENFREW,\nAnd 82, St. Enoch Square, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address: \"WAINSCOT.\" Telephone: 5161, GLASGOW.\n\nM.

Cormack.\n\nBROKERS' ANNUAL CIRCULARS.\nEDMISTON & MITCHELLS.\nIn reviewing the timber trade of the Clyde district for the year 1898, it is gratifying to be able to report a year of prosperity. Trade in all timber-consuming branches has been excellent, excepting perhaps cabinetmaking, which has been somewhat curtailed by a strike, now completing its ninth month. This has, of course, had a restrictive influence on the demand for furniture woods. Very few financial difficulties have occurred, and (with the above exception) has provided uninterrupted by either trade disputes or other detrimental causes.\nHouse building in and around Glasgow has been going on at an unprecedentedly increasing rate, and sawmillers have had considerable difficulty to keep abreast of their orders. The quantity of timber employed in this connection has been enormous.\nLarge quantities of wood goods have been taken by the railway and rolling-stock builders, who have also largely participated in the general prosperity of the country.\nThe import of yellow pine logs is again much reduced, and every year the difficulty of finding more and more towards the use of sawn lumber, which has been largely forced on to all the consumers, and short of them open and business the e[?] pated prove altho[?] dition low [?] season last [?] tional year there future incom[?] our u[?] the e[?] troub[?] Shipb[?] the a[?] 466,8[?] tons [?] the b[?] estima[?] has al[?] condit[?] are or[?] contin[?] impor[?] the co[?]\n\nIMPORTS.\nALLOA.\nDec. 29 Margarete—Memel—340 lds. oak staves—G.
