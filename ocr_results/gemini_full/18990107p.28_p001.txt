TRADE REPORTS.

GLASGOW.
Owing to this being the New Year holiday there is little business to report, as all public works are closed. The arrivals this week are extremely limited, and there is nothing to hand of special note.
Stocks of deals at Glasgow have now been made up as at 31st ult., and particulars are appended:—

Compared with the stock of previous quarter, 30th September, there is a considerable reduction in all items, excepting red pine, the import of which was on a large scale during the last weeks of the Quebec season, than it had been in earlier months; the stock, however, is smaller than it has been for several years. Taken altogether the stocks are nearly 2,000 standards heavier than a year ago.

consumption, however, this year has been correspondingly large. One feature is the large increase in import and consumption of Lower Port spruce deals and battens. During 1898 the import was about 5,000 standards over previous year, and the consumption nearly 8,000 standards larger, while the stock at present is lighter than it was at 31st December, 1897.

LEITH.
There are a few additional arrivals to report since last writing, which really all belong to the old year, although in the case of the last item on the list, same will be reckoned to the credit of the new year, ship having only entered the dock on 2nd inst. The arrivals referred to consist of 28,792 deal and batten ends, and 3,636 pieces lathwood per s.s. "Calabria," from Riga; 676 bundles and 1,184 pieces poplar per s.s. "Prodano," from Baltimore; 7,759 deals and battens per the "Johanna," from Skien.
The s.s. "Calabria" had a very rough passage from Riga, and cargo is being landed in a damaged condition, the deal and batten ends being covered with sodden linseed, and presenting a most extraordinary appearance piled on the quay.
There has been little or nothing doing this week in the way of sending away orders, but now that the holidays are over a fresh start will be made.
Some of the shippers' representatives have been here during the week, and I understand that a quantity of Gromoff goods has been placed for f.o.w. St. Petersburg here and elsewhere at good prices.

BROKERS' ANNUAL CIRCULARS.
EDMISTON & MITCHELLS.
In reviewing the timber trade of the Clyde district for the year 1898, it is gratifying to be able to report a year of prosperity. Trade in all timber-consuming branches has been excellent, excepting perhaps cabinetmaking, which has been somewhat curtailed by a strike, now completing its ninth month. This has, of course, had a restrictive influence on the demand for furniture woods. Very few financial difficulties have occurred, and (with the above exception) has provided uninterrupted by either trade disputes or other detrimental causes.
House building in and around Glasgow has been going on at an unprecedentedly increasing rate, and sawmillers have had considerable difficulty to keep abreast of their orders. The quantity of timber employed in this connection has been enormous.
Large quantities of wood goods have been taken by the railway and rolling-stock builders, who have also largely participated in the general prosperity of the country.
The import of yellow pine logs is again much reduced, and every year the difficulty of finding more and more towards the use of sawn lumber, which has been largely forced on to all the consumers, and short of them open and business the e[?] pated prove altho[?] dition low [?] season last [?] tional year there future incom[?] our u[?] the e[?] troub[?] Shipb[?] the a[?] 466,8[?] tons [?] the b[?] estima[?] has al[?] condit[?] are or[?] contin[?] impor[?] the co[?]
