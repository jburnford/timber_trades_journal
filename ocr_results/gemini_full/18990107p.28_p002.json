Cormack.\n\nBROKERS' ANNUAL CIRCULARS.\nDENNY, MOTT & DICKSON.\nIn reviewing the trade of the Clyde district for the year 1898, it is gratifying to be able to report a year of prosperity. Trade has been excellent, excepting perhaps cabinetmaking, which has been somewhat curtailed by a strike, now completing its ninth month. This has, of course, had a restricting influence on the demand for furniture woods. Very few financial difficulties have occurred, and business with the above exception has proceeded uninterrupted by either trade disputes or other detrimental causes.\nHouse building in and around Glasgow has been going on at an unprecedentedly increasing rate, and sawmillers have had considerable difficulty to keep abreast of their orders. The amount of timber employed in this connection has been enormous.\nLarge quantities of wood goods have been consumed by the railway and rolling-stock companies, who have also largely participated in the general prosperity of the country.\nThe import of yellow pine logs is again considerably reduced, and every year the trade is tending more and more towards the use of sawn lumber, which has been largely imported, cut to all thicknesses. Oak, elm, and red pine are all somewhat in excess of recent years importation.\nIn spruce the import has been extremely large, and has exceeded that of 1897 (which was a record year) by about 5,000 standards. This is largely owing to this commodity taking the place of the Baltic white pine. Notwithstanding this, however, values have been well maintained during the year.\nThe outbreak of hostilities between Spain and America in April was used as a lever to force up the price of pitch pine, and for a short time the desired aim was obtained, but there were too many eager sellers, and by the month of July quotations were quite normal. The consumption of this cheap and useful wood has been unprecedented.\nConsequent upon the large shipbuilding orders the teak market has been in a very healthy condition, and prices have remained firm.\n\nALLISON, COUSLAND & CO.\nIn reviewing the timber trade for the year just ended, it must be admitted that although the volume of business transacted has been large, there has not been the improvement in prices expected, and whatever the results were to merchants here, shippers must have found them anything but satisfactory. The year opened with heavy stocks and weak prices, and during the first few months very little business was done. With the termination of the engineering strike, however, it was anticipated that there would be the looked for improvement, both in business and prices, but although trade was then in a satisfactory condition, the heavy stocks kept values at a very low level. The import of deals during the season has been heavy, eclipsing even that of last year, but the consumption was proportionately good. During the latter part of the year prices improved considerably, although there are yet sellers anxious to clear off old shipments at low figures. In looking to the future there is every reason to expect that the incoming year will be a prosperous one. All our industries are in a healthy condition, with the exception of the cabinet trade, and the trouble here is expected to be settled shortly. Shipbuilding has been exceptionally brisk, the amount of work turned out being record, 466,832 tons being launched as against 340,037 tons last year, and orders on hand exceed even the business done during the year, these being estimated at 550,000 tons. House building has also been in an extremely active and sound condition. Stocks, while in some cases heavy, are on the whole not excessive, and with the continued good trade and granted a moderate import, we look forward with confidence to the coming year.\n\nCANT & KEMP.\nAt the commencement of this year we were face to face with a very serious engineering strike, which greatly hampered the shipbuilding industry up to its termination. Since this trouble has been overcome, business generally has been in a most satisfactory condition. At the commencement of the year and during the early months large stocks were carried which kept prices at a low level, and which must have had a serious effect upon shippers generally. The closing year has been a record one in regard to the import of deals. The consumption, however, has been proportionately good. During the last few months prices have improved, although there are still some anxious sellers desirous to clear off old shipments at low prices. Shipbuilding is exceptionally brisk. The tonnage launched being 467,000 tons as against 341,000 tons last year. While the work on hand in Clyde yards represents practically 544,000 tons, being far and away the biggest total in the industrial history of the river. The house-building trade has also been in an extremely prosperous condition. Rolling stock manufacturers are also fully employed, and have a large amount of work on hand. The cabinet industry, unfortunately, still suffers from the strike, although the trouble is expected to be settled shortly.\n\nTHOMAS KERR & CO.\nTIMBER & STAVE BROKERS,\nCENTRAL CHAMBERS,\n93, HOPE STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"HARDWOOD, GLASGOW.\" Telephone No. 1482.\n\nD.W.

What is required is the forwarding of a larger average width, for which a corresponding increase in value would be recognised.\nThe shipbuilding industry has had an exceptional period of activity, and the amount of work on hand is such as to ensure a prosperous condition of things throughout the coming year. During the closing months of 1898, shipbuilders have been large purchasers of pitch pine, and long average waney board pine, and the stock of the latter carried over by merchants is comparatively small; considerable sales, however,\n\nGREENHEART.\nMACLEAN, TODD, & CO.\nGREENOCK.\nTelegraphic Address,—\"GREENHEART.\"\n\nJAMES JONES,\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\nLARBERT.\nEvery description of round and cut-up Home Timber supplied for Collieries, Cartwrights, Coachbuilders, Boatbuilders, Shipbuilders, &c.
