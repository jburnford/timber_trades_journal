FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

CROCKER, EDMUND, builder, Modbury, Devon. The accounts filed herein discloses liabilities £402 5s. 2d., and assets estimated to produce £324 5s., deficiency £78. The receiving Order was made on the petition of Messrs. Jewson Bros., timber merchants, Plymouth, and the bankrupt states that he had been trading on his own account for 12 months, previous to which he was in business with his father, now deceased. He attributes his failure to "Loss on contracts." He took a contract to erect a chapel, but he was kept six months waiting for the money after it was due. According to the Official Receiver, the debtor has considerably over-estimated his assets, having returned as book debts the balance due to him upon the completion of contracts now in hand. But he had not allowed for the necessary expenditure that would have to be incurred to complete those contracts. Debtor says that chapel building is not profitable work. It is supposed to be, but his father and himself had found out differently. The debtor has no offer to make, and has been adjudicated bankrupt, and the Official Receiver is the Trustee under an order made.
