TRADE REPORTS.

GLASGOW.
Deliveries from the public storage depots have been proceeding on a satisfactory rate, comparing well with last year for corresponding period.
The weather has been favourable for building operations, considering the season of the year, and since the resumption of work after the holidays there has been an active consumption taking place for house-building and shipbuilding, &c.
For some time past the prospect is now good that the long-protracted dispute in the joiners' trade is having been brought to a close as the result of the conference held in Glasgow on the 9th inst.; there appears no reason to doubt that the terms then arranged between the delegates of masters and men will have general acceptance, and that posts will gradually be found for the men who have been so long idle.
There is very little in the way of imports to note for the past week, a few parcels per liners from the States being the only items; a consignment to Edmiston and Mitchells of 60 logs round mahogany (transhipped at Liverpool) has been landed

here, and is in course of delivery to a ship-building firm. The “Tritonia,” from Baltimore, is now due, and brings various parcels of oak, poplar, hickory, walnut, &c. The “Manitoban” from Boston has a shipment of 50 logs square mahogany.
The Caledonian Railway Company’s oak plank contract for current year is reported to be fixed.
The short time that has elapsed since work was resumed after the New Year holidays has not allowed of much being done in sales generally; the outlook, however, is very encouraging.

GREENOCK.
The public works here and in Port Glasgow resumed work on Monday last.
There have been no arrivals of timber cargoes in the interval.
Business has not yet got into full working order, but in the course of a few days will doubtless return to its accustomed groove.
There seems to be lots of shipbuilding and housebuilding in prospect.

LEITH.
Since last report the following arrivals are to hand, viz., 18,848 deals and battens per s.s.
