WILLOW INDUSTRY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.
The growing of willows for weaving, according to a report which has just been issued by the Department of Agriculture, Washington, promises to become an important industry in the United States. Planted with the species of willows useful for basket making, tens of thousands of acres that are worthless for anything else could be made to pay an enormous interest on the invest-

ment; not less, in fact, than 20 or 30 per cent. It is absolutely necessary, however, that the proper varieties should be obtained, also the speculation will not be a success, unless the soil and climate have been found to be adapted to the requirements. The Board of Trade Journal adds, that these varieties should yield many slender rods that are soft and pliable without branching; that these rods should be of a white colour when peeled; and that the stocks shall produce vigorously for a long period of years. The species most successfully grown in the United States is the red osier, which is of German origin. The fine willow ware used in America is largely imported, for the reason that there is very little satisfactory osier grown there as yet. Labour conditions are not well suited to the industry of basking making, except in certain localities, like Syracuse, New York, where the manufacture of salt is carried on largely in the summer, employing a large number of men, who would be out of employment in the winter unless they had basket weaving to fall back on. The manufactory of willow ware from the rods is an industry which, though as yet in its infancy in America, has been slowly growing during the last few years. In 1890 there were in the United States, according to the census, 403 willow ware establishments, with a capital of £540,000, employing 3,732 persons, paying annually the sum of £283,800 for wages, and producing £726,720 worth of manufactured ware. The value of raw material consumed was £279,700—an increase of 61 per cent. over that of 1889.

SOCIAL MEETING.
The first annual social meeting of the work-people of Mr. Jno. Twaddle, East End Saw Mills, Coatbridge, was held on Friday evening last, when about 50 of the workpeople sat down to tea purveyed by Messrs. A. B. Brown in their usual excellent style. The chair was occupied by Mr. Twaddle, who was supported by Mr. Miller, foreman, and Mr. Jas. Main, cashier. After a few remarks of introduction Mr. Twaddle, in which he expressed his pleasure at the good feeling and unanimity that existed in their present relations with his em-ployees and in that effort to draw all together in the closest working harmony. The usual presentation of gifts of tools to apprentices was gone through, and for which Mr. Twaddle was cordially thanked by Mr. Wm. M'Owat, in the name of his fellow apprentices. Thereafter a very extensive programme of songs and recitations was entered upon, Mr. Geo. Love contributing to the entertainment by a series of mandoline selections which were well received. A most enjoyable evening was spent, and terminated by the singing of "Auld Lang Syne."
