COLWILL & Co., 1A, Paradise Street, Lambeth. -At a meeting of creditors held in this matter, it was stated that the unsecured creditors amounted to about £1,200, and the available assets were valued at £325. The attributes his deficiency to losses on contracts, &c.

COPP, ALBERT, builder, 2, Penywila Road, Cardiff. -This debtor attended for his public examination at Cardiff Bankruptcy Court, on Saturday, the 14th inst., before Mr. Registrar Cousins. Mr. G. David (the Official Receiver), however, explained that the accounts had only just been delivered to him, and he could not possibly proceed with the examination. Debtor said he had been utterly unable to furnish them sooner. He had sat up all night making them up. He had hoped to be able to get through them sooner than he did, but it took him more time than he anticipated. The Official Receiver said he did not blame debtor in the matter at all. An adjournment was then effected to the next Court.

HEWSON, EDWARD, and COTTAM, RALPH (trading as Hewson & Cottam), joiners and builders, Cook Street, Rochdale.-These debtors' accounts show liabilities £561 5s. 8d., and assets estimated to produce £69 19s., or a deficiency of £492 6s. 5d. The following are creditors:—
Grandidge, J., Rochdale ... £ 4 4 0
Knott & Barker, Grimsby ... 117 13 4
Parker, J., & Sons, Rochdale ... 220 0 0
Peters, W. A., & Sons, ... 18 3 4
Sherman, Tyrer & Co., Liverpool ... 49 19 1

HORSEY, A.-At the Poole Bankruptcy Court, on Monday, His Honour Judge Philbrick, had before him a motion by the petitioning creditor, Mr. John J. Norton, asking the court to order payment by the Trustee in Bankruptcy in this case of fees and taxed costs incurred herein, amounting to over £20. At the last Court His Honour ordered the Trustee-Mr. Bourner, London manager of the Timber Trades Association-to render a detailed account of receipts and expenditure herein. This order was complied with, and a balance of £24 in hand was shown. At the last Court Mr. Budge appeared for the Trustee, who, on this occasion, was not represented. His Honour gave judgment for the amount claimed, and on the question of costs of this motion ordered that, as there appeared to be no reason why the account had not been paid earlier, the defendant Trustee should himself pay the costs of the two days' proceedings, and not to be taken out of the balance in his hands as trustee. Mr. Bourner appeared to have paid some £10 out of the assets in perfectly legitimate expenses, but the statute is clear as to the priority of his claim for out-of-pocket fees and taxed costs. Mr. Bourner has made an application under Section 104 of the Bankruptcy Act for a rehearing, as he was not present when the case came on, having mistaken the date.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BRACEY, EVAN, and BRACEY, ISAAC, trading as Bracey Bros., builders, Staple Hill, Bristol. An application was made for the discharge of the above-named debtors at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, before His Honour Judge Austin. The Official Receiver reported that the liabilities amounted to £1,213 14s. 9d., and the assets to 1,594 14s., but as a matter of fact they had only realised £6 up to the present. The difference in the assets was due to the inability of the trustee to sell the houses built by the debtors. Eventually, it was decided to adjourn the application, the debtors saying that they should like to pay their creditors 20s. in the £ before obtaining their discharge. His Honour said it might be for the benefit of the creditors to consider whether judgment should be entered against the debtors for a certain sum. Application adjourned accordingly.

STEAD, JOHN, builder, 27, Trinity Road, South Wimbledon, Surrey. The sitting for the adjourned public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Wandsworth Bankruptcy Court, last week, before Mr. Registrar Willoughby and Mr. G. H. Acheson, Assistant.
