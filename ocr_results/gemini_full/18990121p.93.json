He was a Scotchman, born in Kirkeonnel, Dumfriesshire, on May 21st, 1833, and was therefore in his 66th year. His parents were William and Jean Charteris Thomson, his mother being of Amisfield, Dumfriesshire, from which place the family residence in Hamilton took its name. Mr. Thomson came to America when 19 years of age, his father, mother and three sisters accompanying him. They settled at Wellington Square, now Burlington. From there they removed to Puslinch, in Wellington County, between Hamilton and Guelph, an elder brother of deceased, who had come to Canada three or four years before the rest of the family, having settled there. There they took up farming and lumbering, and Mr. Robert Thomson soon became a factor in the lumbering interests of the country. His father died in 1854, but his mother survived many years, passing away at her son's residence in Hamilton about nine years ago, at the age of 88 years. In 1856 deceased went to Cummingsville, county of Halton, and there successfully pursued the lumbering business on a large scale until 1874, when he purchased the business in Hamilton of the late Julius Caesar McCarty. His business grew into great proportions, and of late years he controlled mills at Huntsville, Gravenhurst, Katrine, Powassan, Callendar, Chelmsford, and Biscotasing, with branch offices at Windsor and Toronto, and agencies in Glasgow and Leith, Scotland, and Belfast, Ireland. The business was carried on under the name of Robert Thomson & Company.\nIn public affairs (says the \"Canada Lumberman\") the late Mr. Thomson exercised considerable influence, although he would never consent to accept a public position. For many years he had been a member of the Board of License Commissioners of Hamilton; besides being a director of the Traders' Bank, he was a member of the Board of the Hamilton Electric Light and Power Company, and a former director of the Hamilton Jockey Club. He was on the board of the Central Fair in the old days, and a member of the body that organised the Central Fair Agricultural and Exhibition Company, owners of the Jockey Club property. Mr. Thomson was a member and officer of MacNab Street Presbyterian Church, holding the position of trustee. It was in private life that the fine qualities of the man were seen. He was of a warm hearted and generous disposition, and attracted the respect and esteem of all who knew him. In 1863 he married, and his widow and only son, Mr. J. J. C. Thomson, who has long been connected with his late father in his lumbering interests, survive.\n\nREMOVAL.—In consequence of their old site at Tay Bridge being required by the N.B. Railway Co., for increased siding accommodation, Thos. Winton, Ltd., of Dundee, have removed their works to Tea Braes, Magdalen Yard Road, on the Caledonian Railway Co.'s ground. They have added to their plant the latest improvements in machinery, and are now in a position to do business in all kinds of Home timber.\n\nHAMPTON WICK.—The U.D.C. have decided to apply to the L.G.B. to borrow £2,000 for the purpose of repairing Hampton Court-road.\n\nKIRKWOOD & CO.\nPITWOOD IMPORTERS and\nGENERAL TIMBER MERCHANT\n68, BATH STREET, GLASGOW.\n\n***\n\nTelephone No. 667.\nGlasgow.\n\nTHE SCOTCH FURNITURE TRADE.\nIn connection with the dispute in the Scotch furniture trade, six representatives of the Furniture Trades Association met six representatives of the Scottish Furniture Manufacturers' Association on Monday morning in the offices of Mr. Alexander Russell, secretary of the Manufacturers' Association, to intimate the result of the ballot vote taken in the various districts on the terms of settlement arrived at the recent conference. The totals were 789 for and 206 against—a majority of 583. The question of the reinstatement of the workmen was considered, and the following arrangement was made:—The workmen may apply to their former employers individually, collectively, or otherwise for reinstatement, and on and after the 31st inst. any and every employer may engage any workman who may make application.\n\nTELEPHONE No. 843.\nMONTGOMERY & STRACHAN,\nTimber Merchants,\nSawmillers & Packing Case Makers\nHUTCHESONTOWN SAW MILLS,\nPOLMADIE, GLASGOW\n\nJOHN CAMPBELL,\nTIMBER MERCHANT\nINVERNESS.\nAlways on hand, a Large and Varied Stock of SAWING and COLLIERY TIMBER in Larch and Scots Fir.
