The Official Receiver has issued a further report to the creditors herein. He states that the debtor has now filed a statement of affairs which discloses liabilities £840 14s. 9d. (of which £787 14s. 9d. is expected to rank for dividend), and assets estimated to produce net £65. The debtor has been served with an order for a cash account for the two years immediately preceding the receiving order, and also for an account giving particulars of all contracts taken by him since he commenced to trade, and showing the respective losses or profits made on same.

F., builder, Newport, Mon. The first meeting of creditors to the estate of G. F. Davies, builder, Harrow Road, Newport, was held on Wednesday, the 18th inst., at the offices of the Official Receiver, Newport. The statement of affairs showed a deficiency of £315 11s. 2d. on a trading extending from the 23rd October, 1896. On that date debtor embarked in the business in partnership with another person, each contributing a capital of £20. This partnership was dissolved in July, 1897, when the partner received £23 to go out. The debtor\n\nJANUARY 28, 1899. 7\nWEST AUSTRALIAN KARRI FOR SALE\nAT the Official Receiver's Office, 24, Bond Street, Leeds, on the 20th inst., a meeting was held of the creditors of Wm. Lilley, wood turner, of 21, Back Canning Street and Soho Grinding Mills, Meanwood Road. The Official Receiver presided. The debtor filed his petition on the 4th inst. He owed to unsecured creditors £57 11s. 2d., for rent and rates would probably amount to £4 10s., and his assets would probably realise £4 4s. He commenced business at Leeds about three and a half years ago, having been formerly in business at Bradford. He was then named Edward Crossley. He failed in November, 1896, and he came to Leeds to carry on the business at Soho Mills. He started originally, he put about £100 into the business as capital, and he attributed his failure to the business being short of capital. He called a meeting of his creditors and executed a deed of assignment on December 2nd last, and subsequently he filed his petition. In the meantime the landlord had distrained for rent. The first meeting was fixed for a day or two after the sale, but as it was filed he (Mr. Clegg) made an application, and as he found there was not likely to be any surplus, the distraint went on. The assets realised was not sufficient to pay the rent and the expenses, so that the only assets remaining were what could be got from the book debts, which debtor estimated at £54 1s. 6d. The deficiency would be about £350. The matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver.\nLOWE, THOMAS E.—At Burnley County Court before Mr. Registrar Southern, Thomas Edward Lowe, 21, Rookery Road, Burnley, formerly licensed victualler, and now residing and carrying on business at 21, Rookery Road, came up for his public examination. Liabilities, £457 4s. 1d. In answer to Mr. L. J. Sharp (Official Receiver) the debtor stated that up to two years ago he carried on business as a timber merchant's traveller. About that year he commenced business as a timber merchant in partnership with his brother. He introduced £280 capital. In September, 1896, the partnership was dissolved, and he was paid £700 as his interest in the business. In the following April, paid £200 for the goodwill of the Benyon Arms, Hockley. He paid £100 10s. 6d. for the fixtures, stock and book debts. The valuers represented that the profits would be £12 per week, but the proprietor's drawings were more. Debtor, however, never made anything like that amount. He had to borrow for considerably less than he gave for the goodwill. Further questioned, debtor said, after the valuation he got £164 out of the trade, and then he found he could not pay his way. His creditors refused a composition of 7s. 6d. in the £. At the conclusion of the examination, the Registrar stated that he often had to make remarks, but when there were any circumstances favourable to the debtor he was equally ready to make an observation and give the debtor credit for them. He noticed in the statement of affairs that this debtor had given a preference of £120. That was very creditable, and was a fact in his favour. The examination was concluded.\nRAMSDEN, CHAS., joiner, 18, [?] Street, Greetland, Halifax.
