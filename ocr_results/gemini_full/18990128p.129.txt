FURNITURE TRADE DISPUTE—THE RESUMPTION OF WORK
A meeting of the Scottish Furnishing Facturers' Association was held in Glasgow on Friday—Mr. W. A. Wylie in the chair—at which reports as to the settlement of the recent dispute in the furniture trade were submitted from all the districts.
The men were now, it was intimated, freely returning to work, and arrangements were being made whereby the employers would reinstate as many of their old workmen as possible, and as soon as possible.
Attention was drawn to statements which had been made conveying the inference that the workmen had been successful in the dispute, and it was pointed out that instead the employers had gained on four vital points—piece-work, abolition of restriction, the engagement of non-union workmen, and the limitation of overtime.
Besides the demand of the Beith men for an advance on the minimum rate of wages 2s. per week had been departed from, so that the members of the association had every reason to be satisfied with the way in which the dispute had terminated.
With reference to the position in Dundee, there was now no trouble whatever, and the employers were giving work to as many men as they could.
All over, the settlement was being accepted by masters and men.
