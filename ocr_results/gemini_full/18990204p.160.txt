LEITH.
The imports for the week are unimportant, consisting of 17 pieces of walnut, 30 logs poplar, and 10 lds. poplar lumber per s.s. "Menantic," Baltimore. The frost has not lost any strength, and outdoor work is uninterrupted in the meantime.
There was a public sale held on 31st January, by D. W. Beattie, in Edinburgh Dock, but the proceedings were extremely quiet, and buyers operated sparingly, and apparently only for immediate requirements, so that no business was disposed of.
Redwood deals and battens were firmly held and prices even of whitewood were fairly steady, 6 1/2 x 2 1/2 whitewood battens fetching £1 3-16d. to £1 7-16d. per lineal foot, according to quality.

FALKIRK AND DISTRICT MASTER WRIGHTS' ASSOCIATION.
The annual supper of the above took place in M. Borland's Inn, Robert's Wynd. Mr. James Forgie presided over a good attendance, which included representatives of the Associated Carpenters and Joiners of Scotland. Mr. William Marshall acted as croupier. A recherche repast having been partaken of, the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were proposed by the Chairman. "The Town and Trade of Falkirk" was proposed by Mr. Page, Mr. Weston responding. Mr. Robert Nimmo proposed "The Architects," coupled with the name of Mr. Page. "The Associated Carpenters and Joiners of Scotland" found a sponsor in Mr. Marshall. Mr. William Thomson, president of the local branch of that association, responding. "The Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council" were toasted on the proposal of Mr. John Main, who acknowledged the toast of the evening—"The Falkirk and District Master Wrights' Association," which was proposed in felicitous terms by Mr. Mackenzie (of Messrs. Brownlee & Co., Grangemouth). The toasts were pleasantly interspersed with songs and recitations by several of the company.
