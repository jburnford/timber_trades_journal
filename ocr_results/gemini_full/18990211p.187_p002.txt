FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases where names are published in this column without assets, the debtors are published in order to obtain security for their debts, some time or other, to the full amount.]
BROUGH, GEORGE, builder, Derby. An application was made for the discharge of this debtor at the Derby Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday last before his Honour Judge Sir Dhainchaud. It appeared from the Official Receiver's report that a dividend of 8s. 3d. in the £ had been paid on proofs amounting to £917. The debtor had not kept proper books of account, and he had continued in business after he was aware of his insolvent position. He had also contracted debts without having reasonable or probable expectation of being able to pay them. The discharge was suspended for three years.
BROWN, JAMES, late builder, formerly of 34, Bedford Street, Derby, now lodging elsewhere. The first meeting of the creditors interested hereunder took place on Tuesday last at the offices of the Official Receiver in Derby. The debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through loss on contracts entered into by his brother and himself. The proceedings were of a formal nature, and the estate was eventually left in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.
DANIELS, G., builder, &c., Staines Road, Hounslow. A meeting was held on Wednesday afternoon last at Anderton's Hotel, Fleet Street, when a committee of inspection was elected, and a meeting of five gentlemen, to consider whether the deed of composition should be accepted. The meeting was a lengthy one and of a private nature.
DAVIES, GEORGE FRANCE, Builder, Newport. Debtor attended for his public examination at Newport Bankruptcy Court on the 2nd inst., before Mr. Registrar Davis, the deficiency being £416 11s. 9d. The failure was ascribed to losses on building contracts. He had been in business since October, 1896, and in his examination it appeared that he had taken on a number of contracts; he had been unable to tender successfully. Another cause of loss was the late carpenters' strike. The examination was closed.
HACKETT, CHAS. ERNEST, builder and contractor, Kimberley Villa, Addison Road, King's Heath, lately residing at Fernlea, Westfield Road, King's Heath, and carrying on business in partnership with Humphrey Hanley, as builders and contractors, at 40, Bristol Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham. A new issue of the Birmingham Daily Post, from which it appears that the debtor has filed a statement of affairs showing liabilities amounting to £600, and assets of £15, thus leaving a deficiency of £585. It appears from the report of the Official Receiver, that in March, 1897, the debtor was a builder's clerk, but then entered into partnership with Hanley, to enable them to start business they had to borrow the sum of £100.
JARES WILFRID MURRANT RAPLEY, builder, Forton, Gosport, Hants.
