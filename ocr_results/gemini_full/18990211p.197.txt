convenience to trade this season. It was stated in reply that the work was now progressing more satisfactorily, and that the place would be ready by the time it was required.
Regarding the above, Shieldhall wharf is for the accommodation of vessels discharging deals, &c. One steamer berth has been in use since August last, and it was then hoped that by next May, when the wood imports begin, other two berths would be ready; apparently one more at any rate will then be completed.

LEITH.
The imports during the week consist of 2,400 oak staves, 50 wainscot oak logs, and 3,260 deals per s.s. “Skjalm Hvide,” from Libau ; 4,072 deals and battens per s.s. “Penelope,” from Riga ; 10 logs oak per s.s. “Topaze,” from Newport News ; and 12,000 deals and battens per s.s. “Valund,” from Drontheim.
Business has been quiet this week, but a fair amount is being sent away from the Dock and yarded stocks.
It is satisfactory to see some impression being made on same, as they are undoubtedly heavy, more especially in whitewood.

been no public sale, but an auction announced by John Fleming & Co. for Tuesday, 14th inst., is to be held, but with the usual interval between the firm’s sales.
The difference which arose between the Dock Commissioners and the mercantile community of the Port in connection with the Bill being promoted by the former, and which seemed likely to result in a Parliamentary contest over certain clauses, has been arranged by the substitution of an amended clause. While the opponents of the Bill have not got all they sought, they have reason to be pleased with their substantial success, obtained, as it has been, without any money expenditure. In the future, the Dock Commissioners sought power to feu charter or lease for any term of years, according to law and usage in Scotland, any ground belonging to them not within 200 feet of any dock or harbour quay wall, but these to leasing one particular piece of ground at the east end of the Dock, 200 feet from the Quay wall.

OBITUARY.
RICHARD IMRIE.
Last week there passed away, at his residence, Springfield, Castle Douglas, after a brief illness, Richard Imrie, wood merchant, a gentleman well known throughout the Stewartry and many other parts of Scotland. The fourth son of the late George James Imrie, wood merchant, Richard Imrie was born in Dalbeattie in 1837. The deceased was educated at Mauchline, and, after school days, joined his father in his business. His father did an extensive trade in the counties of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Ayr, but more particularly in the Stewartry, although the family for many years resided at Tarbolton, Ayrshire. It was not until 1870 that they removed to Springfield on his father purchasing this estate. The deceased was married in 1873 to an Ardrossan lady, and resided in Castle Douglas, and afterwards at Imrie Bell Villa, until some years after the death of his father, when he went to reside at Springfield. He was perhaps the oldest and best known wood merchant in the Stewartry. At the time the Kirkcudbright Railway was being put through, and about the time the American War broke out, the family had large contracts for the clearance of timber on estates in the Stewartry. Much of the wood being then used for rice barrel staves a large American order was cancelled about this time in consequence of the war. During the storms of 1884-5 the deceased was engaged on many of the estates in the district; but in recent years the business was considerably extended. After the storms of 1894-5 he bought timber on a great many estates in the North, among others being Glamis Castle, Aldbar Castle, Inshewan, and Fasque. It was more particularly in connection with his own business that he was known, and he was so much bound up in this that he had little opportunity for entering into public affairs. He was in fairly good health up till a few days before his death, when he complained of suffering from cold. Acute pneumonia set in, and he died on Tuesday afternoon in last week. He leaves a widow and six of a family to mourn his loss.
For several years the second son, Robert, has been associated with his father, and we understand that he will carry on the business.
On Tuesday of last week, Ex-Bailie Campbell, of Stirling, died at his residence in Snowdon Place, after a brief illness. Deceased, who was 76 years of age, was a well known wood merchant and had an extensive connection at one time, chiefly in Forfarshire, Stirlingshire, and Perthshire. He entered Stirling Town Council in 1868, and retired in 1874. During his tenure of office he was raised to the magisterial bench.

BIG FIRE AT PETERHEAD.
A disastrous fire broke out last week in the yard of Mr. Charles Carnegie, timber merchant, Windmill Street, Peterhead, the scene of similar disastrous fires within recent years. How the present outbreak occurred is a mystery, originating as it did in the centre of a huge, long pile of battens containing upwards of 200 standards. Indications point to the work of an incendiary, as it is practically an impossibility that a lighted match thrown care-

lessly down could have ignited battens of such thickness as they were. When the fire was discovered, it had not obtained a great hold of the pile, but delay was occasioned in getting the fire brigade together, and it was midnight before water was got to play on the burning mass. Adjoining the pile of battens is the saw-mill and engine house, containing valuable machinery, which was much damaged. Mr. Carnegie values his stock and plant at £4,000, but it is only covered to the extent of £3,000. Mr. Carnegie has been unfortunate in respect of fire. On one occasion, about eight years ago, the whole yard was practically destroyed; and three or four years ago the mill was burned to the ground. The damage caused by the fire is estimated to amount to £1,500.

A CESSIO CASE.
An adjourned examination in petition for cessio against G. Robertson, sawmiller, Marlee, Blairgowrie, at Perth, on Friday, Mrs. Robertson deponed that in April, 1897, her husband lifted his money, amounting to £66, from the bank, and after £3 had been paid to an advocate and £10 to a solicitor the rest was spent in doctor’s bills and household expenses. A sum of £156 she inherited from her father’s estate was lent last year to a relative. Her husband had no furniture in a sister’s custody. G. Robertson deponed he could not tell exactly where the £66 had gone nor what he paid the doctor. He owed his brother-in-law £50 for a year’s rent. The statutory oath was administered.
In the action of Bennetts (Ltd.) v. Williamson, the plaintiffs, the well-known timber merchants, Manchester, sued Mr. A. T. Williamson, timber merchant, of 2, York Buildings, Edinburgh, for £1,047 3s. 4d., the balance of an account for timber supplied to defender by pursuers between December 15th, 1897, and September 3rd, 1898. The defender denies that he owes the sum sued for. The record was closed in the Court of Session, Edinburgh, on the 24th ult., and proof allowed.
