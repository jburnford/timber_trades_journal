Champney & Long, Gloucester) represented the plaintiff and Mr. R. H. Amphlett (instructed by Messrs. Trinder, Capron, & Co., London) the defendants.\n—In opening the case, Mr. Cranstoun said the chief issue to be tried was as to price.\nThe plaintiff contended that the charge was to be 2s. per cubic foot, whilst the defendants alleged that the price was 2s. per sleeper.—Mr. Amphlett mentioned that £38 had been paid into court by the defendants without admitting liability.—Mr. Cranstoun having read correspondence bearing on the matter, called the plaintiff, who admitted that he had received an intimation from the defendants that some of the sleepers in the first consignment were defective.\nThese, however, he was willing to take back, at the same price the goods were invoiced to the defendants.—After further evidence had been given, his Lordship postponed the matter for further consideration.\nIt was stated that the defendants would undertake to return the sleepers.\n\nA DEFECTIVE BEAM.\nAT the Coroner's enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of two men through the falling of roof-timbering at Christ Church, Birmingham, which took place on Friday last, at the Victoria Courts, Birmingham, the jury returned a verdict of \"accidental death,\" and added that they thought the city authorities should take cognisance of the demolition of buildings, seeing that it was attended with considerable danger to life and limb.\nThe Coroner promised to convey the representation to the proper quarter.\n\nKIRKWOOD & CO.\nPITWOOD IMPORTERS AND\nGENERAL TIMBER MERCHANT\n68, BATH STREET, GLASGOW.\n\nESTABLISHED 1852.\nTELEPHONE No 662.\nM. & J.
