was done both in Baltic and American goods.
The quantity of waney board pine offered was as large as usual at this firm's sales, and the whole of it was cleared at 2s. 4d. to 2s. 9d. per cubic foot, averaging about 2s 7d.
A parcel of small-sized birch logs was sold at 1s. 5d. to 1s. 6d. ; but for prime large logs the figure was 2s. 2d. to 2s. 6d., being well sold at 2s. 6d.
A very large quantity and large size of yellow pine deals, boards and sidings was disposed of, first quality long deals fetching 3s. 1d., and 12 x 2 broad deals 1s. per cubic foot, whilst the first quality deal ends ranged from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 7d. according to widths; and third quality deal ends 1s. 7d.
There was a good demand for Baltic deals and battens, for which very satisfactory prices were got, and although the redwood battens were not on the whole so good, they were fair market value, and were disposed of, it being principally Norwegian and Riga shipmen s, and these met with a ready sale at 1s 1d per lineal foot for 6½ x 2½, whilst Swedish and Peters-burg, which were in less request, brought 1s 1½d per lineal foot.
The sale concluded with the floorings, linings, and sarkings, of which there were very considerable lines placed at fairly good rates, and the ex-posers seemed quite satisfied with the result of the auction.

A TIMBER MERCHANT'S CLAIM.
AT the Gloucester Assizes, Herbert Lancaster, trading as Lancaster & Co., English timber merchants, Newent, brought an action to recover the sum of £126 11s. from Burt, Boulton, & Hayward, importers of foreign timber, Newport, for a quantity of oak sleepers.—Mr. Cranstoun (instructed by Messrs. Champney & Long, Gloucester) represented the plaintiff and Mr. R. H. Amphlett (instructed by Messrs. Trinder, Capron, & Co., London) the defendants.
—In opening the case, Mr. Cranstoun said the chief issue to be tried was as to price.
The plaintiff contended that the charge was to be 2s. per cubic foot, whilst the defendants alleged that the price was 2s. per sleeper.—Mr. Amphlett mentioned that £38 had been paid into court by the defendants without admitting liability.—Mr. Cranstoun having read correspondence bearing on the matter, called the plaintiff, who admitted that he had received an intimation from the defendants that some of the sleepers in the first consignment were defective.
These, however, he was willing to take back, at the same price the goods were invoiced to the defendants.—After further evidence had been given, his Lordship postponed the matter for further consideration.
It was stated that the defendants would undertake to return the sleepers.

A DEFECTIVE BEAM.
AT the Coroner's enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of two men through the falling of roof-timbering at Christ Church, Birmingham, which took place on Friday last, at the Victoria Courts, Birmingham, the jury returned a verdict of "accidental death," and added that they thought the city authorities should take cognisance of the demolition of buildings, seeing that it was attended with considerable danger to life and limb.
The Coroner promised to convey the representation to the proper quarter.
