he L.C.C. and Local Boards, London will be found, and the important decisions under the New London Building Act, 1894, of the Superior Courts and the Tribunal of Appeal are given in detail. "Heads of Cases" brought before the police courts under the same act are also given.
The work still maintains the historic position it has so long enjoyed among architects, surveyors, builders and contractors, as being the acknowledged standard to which in disputed cases in the various law courts reference is made.

AN INTERESTING COMMEMORATION.
On February 11th Mr. A. A. Atkin, a director of Atkin & Sons, Limited, saw, plane and tool manufacturers, of Birmingham, gave a dinner to upwards of 100 of his employees at the Market Hotel, Station Street, Birmingham, to commemorate the coming of age of his eldest son, Mr. Geo. Wilfred Atkin. The chair was occupied by Mr. A. A. Atkin, there being present Messrs. Thos. Onions (director), E. Atkin, C. Hill, C. Bailey, W H Hadley, C. Parsons, and others. After the loyal toasts were given and duly honoured, Mr. Wm. Barnes proposed the toast of "The Firm," which he done in a very able manner, reviewing the history of the firm for upwards of 50 years. The Chairman responded, asking for the co-operation of all the employees to combine to make the company a still further success. Mr. G. Milner then proposed the health of Mr. Geo. Wilfred Atkin, which was most enthusiastically received and drank with musical honours, and was suitably responded to by Mr. G. W. Atkin. Mr. Milner then made a presentation on behalf of the employees to Mr. G. W. Atkin of a magnificent marble clock as a token of their respect and esteem. Mr. G. W. Atkin, in thanking them most heartily for their valuable present, hoped the good feeling would be maintained between employer and employee. The remainder of the evening was devoted to a concert, some capital songs being ably rendered. Mr. F. Barnes gave three humorous recitations of character, which were highly appreciated and brought encores. Mr. Alfred Owen presided at the pianoforte, and a most enjoyable evening was terminated by the breaking up of the party at 11 p.m.
