The Official Receiver (Mr. T. H. Geake), reported that the receiving order was made on April 5th, 1894. A dividend of 1s. 6 1/4d in the pound was paid on proofs for £259. Debtor undertook contracts without sufficiently ascertaining his position, and was very careless in respect of them. He had omitted to keep books of account, and had continued to trade after knowing himself to be insolvent.—In answer to Mr. Geake, debtor said immediately after the bankruptcy proceedings had been closed he went to Johannesburg, and returned without having made money. He had only just sufficient to bring him back to England. He denied he was a party to the purchase of considerable quantities of land with a Mr. Truscott, or that he had any financial interest in the undertaking. The judge pronounced a warning to those who carried on business without keeping proper books of account. It was not sufficient for a debtor to try to excuse himself on the plea that he was illiterate. If a man had sufficient intelligence to start a business, he was presumed to have sufficient intelligence to keep accounts.—The discharge was granted, on condition that £30 was paid to the Official Receiver.\nDILLON, LINN, Croydon. An adjourned meeting of the creditors in this matter was held on Wednesday 22nd, at the Official Receiver's Office Railway Approach, and the meeting was further adjourned for three weeks.\n\nDINGLE, JOHN HENRY, Lostwithiel. This bankrupt applied to Honour Judge Grainger at the Truro Bankruptcy Court, on Saturday for his order of discharge. Mr. R. Dobell appeared on behalf of the bankrupt, and Mr. G. Appleby Jenkins represented the Board of Trade.—Mr. Dobell said it would be seen from the report that the estate had realised in the hands of the trustee £2 19s. in the £, and the bankrupt had paid to the creditors the remaining 1s. in the £, making 20s. in the £, to the debts in full. The Official Receiver had reported two things against the debtor, that he did not keep proper books of account, and that in 1894 he executed a deed of assignment for the benefit of his creditors. Having regard to all the circumstances he thought the best course was to apply to the Court.—The discharge was granted, subject to the proceedings. Therefore there would be an adjournment for a month in order to give notice to the Official Receiver of the application. It would be seen that the estate was not in a bad condition, as the creditors had been paid after the first meeting 20s. had been met.—His Honour said the bankrupt kept books he need not have kept under the Bankruptcy Court.—The Official Receiver concurred in what Mr. Dobell said. Mr. Dingle had not been a particular creditor he need not have come to the Court at all.—The Judge said in all these cases that come before me, I am always more inclined to help Mr. Dingle than to press him. He deserved the sympathy of everybody.—The case was adjourned for a month.\nHACKETT, CHARLES ERNEST, builder, Addison Road, King's Heath, lately trading in co-partnership with Humphrey Huxley, at 75, 81 and 83 Summer Road, Edgbaston, as builder and contractor.—Public examination. Liabilities £608 1s. 3d., assets £13 19s. 6d. Mr. G. Rigby appeared for a creditor.—In reply to Mr. Sharp (Official Receiver), bankrupt stated that he started in business with Huxley in March 1897. He had no capital, and left a situation as a builder's foreman to start on his own account. One contract at Moseley he estimated they lost £450, chiefly through the rise in the price of materials. The partnership had never been actually dissolved.—In reply to Mr. Rigby, bankrupt stated that he got married three weeks before he found out that he was insolvent.—The Registrar remarked that he could not understand why Huxley was not standing by bankrupt's side. The examination was concluded.\nMORGAN, JOHN, timber merchant, the Ashtead Sawing, Planing and Moulding Mills, Foster Street, Birmingham. At the Birmingham County Court, on Thursday last week before his Honour Judge Whitehorne, an application was made for the rescission of the order of the conditional discharge.—Mr. Pearson appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. J. S. Pritchett (instructed by Messrs. Green and Williams) represented Mr. Morgan.—Mr. Pearson explained that he had previously applied for directions to prosecute for perjury but his Honour did not think a criminal offence had been committed, although he strongly expressed himself concerning Mr. Morgan's conduct, and desired that this application should be made. Morgan became bankrupt in 1887 and obtained his discharge in 1894 on condition that he paid £300 by instalments of half his income over £100 per annum. Counsel then read an affidavit of the Official Receiver which stated that Mr. Morgan had filed yearly accounts and affidavits, showing that his net income was only £100 a year, but he had not paid anything on account of the £300. Mr. Thomas Adams, of the firm of N. Adams and Co., with whom Mr. Morgan was employed as manager, stated, on affidavit, that Mr. Morgan's answers when examined on oath relating to salary, commission, and household rent were incorrect. He had only received £2 a week and 15 per cent. commission, and he was in a position of a servant. The affidavit of Mr. Morgan was untrue, as he had not disclosed the whole of the salary he received from his employers.—Mr. Pearson said that no affidavits had been filed in reply to those. The application was considered by the Official Receiver to be an important one. Conditional orders of discharge were made against bankrupts—orders that were fair and reasonable—and then the Official Receiver was practically in their hands. They filed affidavits, and in the majority of cases the Official Receiver had no means of testing the correctness or truth of those affidavits. In the present case, Mr. Morgan had gone on swearing for years that he was only receiving £2 per week when he was earning a much larger sum. There was no desire on behalf of the Official Receiver or the Board of Trade to press this application unduly, or prejudice the interests of the creditors. At the same time, it was a serious matter. He did press for a recission if his Honour thought the interests of the creditors it was better that the conditional discharge should be allowed to stand.—Mr. Pritchett said he did not contest statements made against Mr. Morgan as a whole. No doubt he had not fairly and candidly disclosed his income. His Honour had already held that he had not made such statements as would justify a prosecution for perjury, and that was about the most that could be said in his favour, except that, in regard to his examination before Registrar Parry, he was in the position that he was threatened with prosecution on the previous affidavit. He was in fact threatened, but circumstances justified him in thinking that prosecution for perjury was imminent, and he was in the position of a man in the French courts, who was catechised and cross-examined to make a case against himself. He pleaded that his Honour would not press him harshly as to what he had said at the examination. He was prepared to make an offer that would be a punishment to his client and beneficial to the creditors. The offer was contained in a letter written by Mr. Morgan's solicitors after the serving of the notice of motion. The terms were that Mr. Morgan would pay within one month all arrears due under the order of discharge upon the footing of the account rendered to the Official Receiver by the secretary of the company; secondly, he would pay within the same period the costs of this motion and previous costs in reference to this matter; and, thirdly, he would undertake to keep accurate accounts of his private business, and have them audited by a professional auditor, the certificate to be annexed to future affidavits. Counsel explained that Mr. Morgan was in a business on his own account as a timber merchant. That offer was made with a full admission of the debtor that he had not fully and candidly disclosed his income, and he believed much might be said in mitigation. Mr. Pritchett submitted that it would be in the interests of creditors not to rescind the order of discharge. Mr. Morgan was sixty years of age, and if left an undischarged bankrupt he would be unable to carry on business, and it would be very difficult for him to obtain employment more than sufficient for a bare livelihood. Mr. Morgan had expressed his regret at what he had done, and threw himself upon the mercy of the Court. Counsel urged that the case should be adjourned for a month in order that the arrears and expenses might be paid up.—Mr. Pearson did not object.\n\nRE[?]\nCable advice from the C[?]\n66,724 L[?]\nMILLAR[?]\n72[?]\nTelegrams[?]",
