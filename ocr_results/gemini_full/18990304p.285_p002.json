The assets were estimated to realise £455 17s. 8d., from which £11 15s. 10d. had to be deducted for preferential creditors payable in full, leaving a deficiency of £945 17s. 10d. Resolutions were eventually passed appointing Mr. J. Adnitt, high bailiff of the Peterborough County Court, as trustee, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection consisting of the following gentlemen:—Mr. Jonathan Bodger, of English Bros., Limited, Mr. A. Ball, and Mr. Hookey, of Hayward, Ruffell & Co. The remuneration of the trustee was left to the committee of inspection.\n\nCRAMP, GEORGE, builder, Gladstone Terrace, Clive Vale, Hastings.—The above-named debtor appeared for his public examination at the Hastings Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday last, before the Registrar. In answer to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he had built a number of houses, and as he could not sell them, he was obliged to mortgage them. He had been greatly troubled by County Court summonses. The examination was formally adjourned until the next Court, when it was stated the debtor would be allowed to pass.\n\nJOHNSON, JAMES, builder, Crewe.—The above-named bankrupt appeared for his public examination at the Crewe Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Speakman, on Friday of last week. The summary of accounts filed by the debtor showed liabilities amounting to £2,861, of which £1,603 were expected to rank for dividend. The deficiency was £616. The debtor attributed his insolvency to losses on a large number of building contracts for buildings, and especially to a large loss on sewering and road-making contracts for the Crewe Corporation. He had not kept proper books. The examination was adjourned.\n\nJONES, JAMES PRICE, builder and contractor, Mount Pleasant, Abercynon.—The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under the failure of James Price Jones, took place at the offices of the Official Receiver, Merthyr, on Thursday last week. It appeared from the statement of affairs filed by the debtor, that there were 39 unsecured creditors, with liabilities amounting to £360 8s. 8d., and two creditors fully secured for £640. The securities in the hands of fully secured creditors were estimated to realise a surplus of £160.\n\nMARCH 4, 1899.\nTHE T[?]\nMILLARS' KARR[I]\nRecord [?]\nCable advice from [?] for the [?]\n66,724\nFor particulars [?]\n72, BISHOPSG[ATE]\nTelegrams—\"JARRAH, LONDON.\"\ndeficiency after deducting the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, was returned at £417 1s. 10d. The debtor alleged his failure to be caused through loss on contracts, no demand for houses in the locality, and want of capital. The estate was eventually left in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration.\n\nLOVETT, CHARLES, 34, Harford Street, Birmingham, timber dealer, came up for his public examination on Wednesday last, at the Birmingham County Court. Debts £371. Assets £62. Mr. Rabnett appeared for the bankrupt. In reply to Mr. L. J. Sharp (official receiver), the bankrupt stated that up to November, 1893, he was assisting his father in his business as a timber merchant at 34, Harford Street. In that year his father died and left him a share of his property. He purchased his father's business for £300. In order to do so he borrowed £253 from his sister and £80 from a friend, which, however, he subsequently repaid. He was hampered in his trading by want of ready money, and in September last he became aware that he was insolvent.—In reply to Mr. Rabnett, he said he had paid for his business £200 or £300 more than it was worth. The examination was concluded.\n\nLUNT, ARTHUR, builder, Tunstall. At Hanley, on Tuesday before Mr. E. Tennant (Registrar), this bankrupt appeared for his public examination upon a statement showing gross liabilities amounting to £1,252 1s. 7d. of which £812 is expected to rank for dividend. The deficiency was estimated at £886 1s. 11d. Mr. H. W. Adams represented the bankrupt, who assigned as the causes of his failure \"sickness of the debtor and losses on building contracts and speculations.\" In answer to questions by Mr. F. P. Lamb (Deputy Official Receiver), the bankrupt stated that he commenced business thirteen years ago in partnership with Mr. Colclough, and that at the end of five years the partnership was dissolved, he paying the outgoing partner £38. It was thought that there was not room for the two, and he (the debtor) was then £70 to the good. Afterwards while trading alone, he estimated that on one contract for £363 he lost £100, because he was prevented by illness from attending to the work, and also because he had under-estimated the cost. He had made a profit on his contracts for two or three years. The examination was closed.\n\nNORMAN, GEORGE, builder, late of 1, School Road, Crookes, now of 15, Park Road, Sheffield. The adjourned public examination of the above named debtor took place at the Sheffield Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week, before Mr. Registrar Binney. A summary of accounts filed by the debtor showed liabilities amounting to £289 4s., and the assets were estimated to produce a [?]\n\nFOSBERY, WHEELER & C[O]\nBOX & PACKING CASE MANUFACTURERS,\nBEULAH SAW MILLS, POWNALL RO[AD]\nDALSTON, N.E.\n\nW.
