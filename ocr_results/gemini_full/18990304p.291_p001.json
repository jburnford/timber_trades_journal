The outlook in our chief wood-consuming industries is very encouraging, the extent of work to be carried through giving a prospect of sustained activity for a considerable time to come.\nIn Clyde ship-building the returns of launches for February are somewhat disappointing, considering the quantity of work on hand, there being over 100,000 tons more work contracted for than this time last year. The amount put into the water during last month was 25,583 tons, against 24,554 tons last February.\nNew work booked during the month is given at 20,000 tons.\nThere are no auction sales to report, but a satisfactory amount of business is being done in pine and spruce deals, at very firm prices.\nTwo sales are fixed, one by McDowall and Neilson on the 9th inst., and the other by Singleton, Dunn & Co., both at Greenock.\nThe imports since last writing have been light, consisting of 380 standards spruce\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nRobert Hamilton & Co.\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n75, ST.
