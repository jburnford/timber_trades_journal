TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
Trade here continues satisfactory, and deliveries are well maintained. The outlook in our chief wood-consuming industries is very encouraging, the extent of work to be carried through giving a prospect of sustained activity for a considerable time to come.
In Clyde ship-building the returns of launches for February are somewhat disappointing, considering the quantity of work on hand, there being over 100,000 tons more work contracted for than this time last year. The amount put into the water during last month was 25,583 tons, against 24,554 tons last February.
New work booked during the month is given at 20,000 tons.
There are no auction sales to report, but a satisfactory amount of business is being done in pine and spruce deals, at very firm prices.
Two sales are fixed, one by McDowall and Neilson on the 9th inst., and the other by Singleton, Dunn & Co., both at Greenock.
The imports since last writing have been light, consisting of 380 standards spruce

deals landed at Yorkhill Wharf, ex “Concordia,” from St. John, N.B., consigned to Singleton, Dunn & Co., and 180 birch logs for Calder, Henderson, & Livingston; and ex “Orthia,” from Baltimore, discharging at Princes’ Dock, a variety of oak in log and plank, whitewood, etc., for various consignees.
Deliveries from recent arrivals of wainscot-oak, teak, and other hardwoods have been made to a large extent ex ship.
The demand for hardwoods since the close of the furniture trade strike has greatly improved, and an active business is doing in most staples.
Walnut logs are in good demand, especially when of good quality and size, there is at present a very small stock, and the import for some time has been restricted.
Birch logs coming to hand from St. John, N.B., are finding purchasers ex quay, and some fair deliveries are being made from the only lower port cargo at present in stock.

LEITH.
There are practically no arrivals to report this week, the only item being 383 bdls. poplar lumber, per s.s. “Prodano,” from Baltimore.

this month the importation of wood for the far behind the corresponding quarter of last year, and this will help to reduce the old stocks proportionately quicker.
There was a public sale held by D. W. Beattie, on Tuesday, February 28th, at the Edinburgh Dock, at which there was an average attendance.
The demand ran chiefly on the cheaper descriptions of deals and battens, of which buyers bought freely, but for the best qualities the prices offered were below poser’s ideas, and consequently little business resulted in these.
There was a good clearance made of the cheaper goods, and prices of same were fairly satisfactory.
