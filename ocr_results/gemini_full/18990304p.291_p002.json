CALDER.\nThis action came on for hearing, before Lord Shand, Lord Watson, and Lords Davey, James, and Morris, in the House of Lords, on Thursday, and was an appeal from the First Division of the Court of Session. It was originally presented by the late Mr. Adam Teacher, wine and spirit merchant, Glasgow, and now insisted by his trustees, against Mr. James Calder, timber merchant, in Glasgow, trading under the firm of Calder & Co. The action was raised for the purpose of obtaining an account of the profits in connection with the Calder & Co.'s timber business, in order to ascertain the share which should fall to Mr. Teacher, and it concluded for certain payments as the alleged balance due on the accounts in 1889. According to the statements in the appeal, the respondent replied to Mr. Teacher for an advance of capital to extend his timber business. Mr. Teacher, who was an intimate friend, agreed to make an advance of £15,000 under an agreement, and to become security for a cash credit of £20,000, also for the purpose of extending the respondent's timber business. By the agreement Mr. Teacher was to get five per cent. on the £15,000, and 37½ per cent. of the profits of the timber business.\n\nMANUFACTURERS OF\n[Illustration of a factory with text \"Albion Emery Mills, NEW MILLS, near STOCKPORT.\" and \"HOME & FOREIGN GLUES\"]\nJ. & E. DALTON & CO., Limited\nEmery Manufacturers\n\nThe respondent was to make up his capital in the business to £15,000, and not to withdraw any portion until the loan was repaid, and Mr. Teacher's liability for the bank credit discharged. Provision was made for the books of the timber business being annually balanced and audited, and if in any year the capital should be found to have fallen below £15,000 the respondent was to make it up to that amount; and by the same agreement the certificate issued by the auditors was declared to be binding on both parties as finally fixing the profits of each year, and the interest or percentage payable to Mr. Teacher. The agreement was to continue for five years, with a break at an earlier period, which, however, was not taken advantage of. It appears that certain payments had been made to Mr. Teacher by the respondent, but the greater part of Mr. Teacher's interest was allowed to remain in the business, and in that way to increase the amount of his capital from £15,000 to £20,000. At the end of the five years the £15,000 was repaid with interest, and the obligation to the bank was discharged. It also appeared that the accounts were kept for many years by a firm of accountants in Glasgow. At the end of the five years, and before the final audit of the accounts had been made for the last year, it was alleged that certain facts came to the knowledge of Mr. Teacher, which aroused his suspicions as to the accuracy of the sums found to belong to him, and, further, that some of the money advanced for the purpose of the timber business had been employed by the respondent for the purpose of another business, thereby, it was alleged, reducing the profit to which Mr. Teacher was entitled. On these alleged facts becoming known to Mr. Teacher, he brought an action for the purpose of obtaining a full and true account of the profits of the timber business during the period of the agreement, and to recover damages for breach of contract by the respondent in withdrawing his capital. The respondent met these allegations with the answer that the profits of the firm payable to the late Mr. Teacher had been finally fixed and ascertained in terms of the agreement by the auditor's certificates, and on the question of damages he further pleaded that the agreement had not been broken, and that Mr. Teacher had suffered no loss in consequence of the respondent's alleged breach of its terms. The case came before Lord Low, who dismissed the action. Mr. Teacher presented a reclaiming note to the First Division, which recalled the Lord Ordinary's judgment, and gave decree against the respondent for £250 in name of damages, and gave the respondent two-thirds of his taxed costs. The result was that the accounting was refused, and Mr. Teacher, though nominally successful to the extent of £250, practically lost the case. On the question of the audit, Lord Adam dissented from the view of the Lord President and Lord M'Laren. Lord Adam was of opinion that the books of Calder & Co. had never been audited under Article 5 of the agreement, and that, therefore, Mr. Gairdner's certificates were not final. It was contended, on behalf of the appellants, that the Court of Session ought to have ordered the case to be re-heard on the question of the account of the profits of the business. The Dean of Faculty opened the case for the appellants, arguing that an accounting ought to be allowed so as to ascertain the profits, as the audit had not been conducted on ordinary commercial lines, and not to ascertain what profit ought to be divided between Mr. Teacher and the respondent. He also argued that the respondent had made a deduction for a bad debt which ought to have been written off the year before Mr. Teacher made his advance, and that too large sums were written off for depreciation of plant and stock. The case was then adjourned.\n\nJOHN CAMPBELL,\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\nINVERNESS.\nAlways on hand, a Large and Varied Stock of MINING and COLLIERY TIMBER in Larch and Scots Fir.
