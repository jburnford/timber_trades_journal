The debtor was allowed to pass his public examination.\n\nDEE, HENRY, builder, 17, Bromsgrove Street, Birmingham.—At the Kingston Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday last week, Mr. Maton, the Official Receiver, said that the accounts furnished by the debtor since the last adjournment were found to be very incomplete. The debtor was summoned to him, but had since disappeared. The case had been several times adjourned. The debtor's plea that he was too ill to attend was therefore unable to supply the deficiency. He had asked for but a doctor who had been sent at the request of the Official Receiver said that he was perfectly able to attend. It was for the purpose of giving information to the creditors. Mr. Dee said that he had had great difficulty in furnishing particulars of certain invoices having been lost. He denied that at the time of the sale of his business he was aware of his position. He had no bearing of his wife's means, and his wife had been in the habit of keeping the accounts which he filed he considered to be correct. He had made mistakes, but these had been corrected, and should have reached the Official Receiver that morning. The Deputy Official Receiver said the debtor he could not explain the deficiency. He would give through in time. The Registrar said he should again adjourn the case for a month, and within 21 days the debtor must supply the Official Receiver required.\n\nGOYNE, RICHARD F., timber merchant, lately carrying on business at 104 Anderton Road, Sparkbrook.—At the Birmingham Court of Bankruptcy, Mr. Richard Francis Goyne, trading as Goyne and Co., lately carrying on business at 17, Bromsgrove Street, Birmingham, as a timber merchant, under the style or firm of W. H. Harris, was adjudicated a bankrupt by Mr. Registrar Parry.\n\nCable advice from\n66,724\nMILLARS\n72, BI\nTelegrams: \"Jarrah,",
