TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
Trade here continues brisk and deliveries
from the yards since the year began show a
large percentage more than during the same
period last year.
The activity in shipbuilding and house
building continues unabated and a fairly
satisfactory amount of sales are being made
at firm prices, although there is little of
importance to note this week. The import
task from hardwoods, amongst which is the
"Orthis" (s) from Baltimore, which has on board 92 logs
whitewood, and a large
consists of oak planks for several con-
signees. Deliveries from hardwoods re-
cently landed are going on actively ex quay,
and very little lately has had to be yarded.
The market is bare of whitewood, walnut

and mahogany, and any lots coming to hand
are almost always sold on arrival.
The enquiry for mahogany is good and a
cargo directed to this market would meet a
good demand.

LEITH.
The arrivals this week consist of 28,867
deals and battens and 1,742 bdls. boards per
"Valund" (s) from Drontheim; 4 car loads
white pine boards and 109 bdls lumber per
"Croma" (s) from New York; 50 wainscot
oak logs and 46,329 oak staves per "Peters-
burg" (s) from Libau.
Business is going along fairly well; the
dispute between the National Association of
Master Builders and the Operative Plasterers'
Association does not affect the trade in Scot-
land, the plasterers in Scotland not being
members of the National Association, and
the relations between employers and em-
ployed being at present perfectly friendly.
There was a public sale held on Tuesday,
7th inst., by W. M. Low & Co., Ltd., at the
Burgh Saw Mills. Favoured with fine
weather and a good attendance of buyers,
there was a considerable business done. The
sale partook however, of the character of a
clearing sale, and prices were somewhat
