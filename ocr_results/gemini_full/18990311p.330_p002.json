A. S.\nLovendal's new French - English Technical\nDictionary, including, in both languages, the\nnames of tools, utensils, etc., employed in\ntrades and industries. This is not only a very\nuseful, but indispensable work to all those who\nhave business relations with French firms. It\nis divided into 46 sections, such as Saws,\nwoodworkers' tools, chisels, ripping chisels,\nplane irons, grooving and moulding irons,\nwheelers', carpenters', shipbuilders', joiners',\nminers', and metalworkers' tools, etc., etc. It\nis a very comprehensive work well got up, and\nis a credit to the editors, Boyveau and\nChevillet, of 22, rue de la Banque, Paris.\n“Sell's Commercial Intelligence” appeared\nlast week in the fresh garb of an attractive\ngreen cover. Its object is to review the world's\ntrade for the benefit of British traders, and\nkeep them posted not only as to the needs of\nforeign markets, but as to the encroachments\nof foreign competition in the home market.\nThere is something to interest every merchant\nand manufacturer in this remarkable produc-\ntion—we might add something to interest every\nintelligent and patriotic citizen, whether en-\ngaged in trade or not.\nThe half-yearly number of “Specification”\nhas been forwarded to us. The work, we are\nsure, will be found very useful and interesting\nto architects, surveyors, and engineers when\nspecifying, and for those others who are con-\nnected with the building trade. The book,\nwhich comprises some 628 pages, neatly printed\nand on good paper, is divided into three\ndivisions, viz., Professional Practice, Build-\nings in Progress, and Construction. In\nDivision I. we must direct attention to the\nArchitect and Engineering Section, which\nforms very interesting and instructive reading.\nAn article also that should be widely read (and\nespecially so by the members of local boards\nand vestries) is that on the “Leyton Pressed\nSludge and Dust Destructor,” by William\nDawson. Such a half-yearly book as this is\ncannot fail to be of great benefit to the build-\ning and kindred trades, and we recommend it\naccordingly.\n\nMR. WM. CAMERON, a prominent lumberman\nand manufacturer of the South-west of the\nUnited States, died at Morgan City, Louisiana,\nof apoplexy, on February 6th, aged 65. Mr.\nCameron was born in Perthshire, and at the\nage of 14 was apprenticed to an attorney in\nEdinburgh. At the age of 18 he emigrated to\nNew York. His connections in the lumber\ntrade throughout Texas were very extensive.\n\nPURE v. MIXED FORESTS.—On Friday even-\ning last, Sir Dietrich Brandis, K.C.S.I., LL.D.,\nex-Inspector of Forests in India, delivered an\naddress on this subject at 5, St. Andrew\nSquare, Edinburgh, under the auspices of the\nRoyal Scottish Arboricultural Society. The\nEarl of Mansfield, President of the Society,\npresided, and there was a large attendance of\nforesters, nurserymen, and others interested.\nAfter the lecture questions were invited, a\ncircumstance which was taken full advantage\nof by the audience.\n\nESTABLISHED 1852.
