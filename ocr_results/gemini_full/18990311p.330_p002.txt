J. YOUNG & SONS, LTD.
This company has been formed, with a
capital of £100,000 (divided into 5,000 five
per cent. cumulative preference and 5,000
ordinary shares of £10 each) for the pur-
pose of acquiring, carrying on, and extend-
ing the business of J. Young & Sons,
Railway and Public Works Contractors, Edin-
burgh. The subscription list opens on Monday

BUILDING ACCIDENT.
Decision has been given by Sheriff Spens in
an action for damages at the instance of Annie
Isaae or Hart, wife of Edward Hart, labourer,
166, Blackburn Street, Plantation, Glasgow,
against William Orr, builder, 11, Bothwell
Street, Glasgow. The action was raised in
respect of injuries sustained by the pursuer on
the 19th September last through the collapse
of a building occupied by Cooper
and Co. at the corner of Napier Street and
Govan Road, of which it was averred, the
defender was the owner and builder. Liability
was disputed on record, but the defender after-
wards lodged a minute admitting liability.
Proof was led on the question of damages.
His Lordship awarded the pursuer £35, and
finds her entitled to expenses.

MILFORD DOCKS BILL.—An official notice
has been given by the Milford Docks Company
of their intention not to proceed further during
the present Session of Parliament with the
Bill by which they proposed to seek
powers to increase the amount of special charge
debenture stock which they are authorised to
issue from £70,000 to £100,000, and to place
the whole of this stock before the debenture
stock “A.” It was further proposed to create
£250,000 pre-preference stock for the purpose
of funding the arrears of interest on debenture
stocks “A” and “B,” and to make all future
interest on these stocks payable only out of
profits.

REVIEWS.
We have received a copy of U. A. S.
Lovendal's new French - English Technical
Dictionary, including, in both languages, the
names of tools, utensils, etc., employed in
trades and industries. This is not only a very
useful, but indispensable work to all those who
have business relations with French firms. It
is divided into 46 sections, such as Saws,
woodworkers' tools, chisels, ripping chisels,
plane irons, grooving and moulding irons,
wheelers', carpenters', shipbuilders', joiners',
miners', and metalworkers' tools, etc., etc. It
is a very comprehensive work well got up, and
is a credit to the editors, Boyveau and
Chevillet, of 22, rue de la Banque, Paris.
“Sell's Commercial Intelligence” appeared
last week in the fresh garb of an attractive
green cover. Its object is to review the world's
trade for the benefit of British traders, and
keep them posted not only as to the needs of
foreign markets, but as to the encroachments
of foreign competition in the home market.
There is something to interest every merchant
and manufacturer in this remarkable produc-
tion—we might add something to interest every
intelligent and patriotic citizen, whether en-
gaged in trade or not.
The half-yearly number of “Specification”
has been forwarded to us. The work, we are
sure, will be found very useful and interesting
to architects, surveyors, and engineers when
specifying, and for those others who are con-
nected with the building trade. The book,
which comprises some 628 pages, neatly printed
and on good paper, is divided into three
divisions, viz., Professional Practice, Build-
ings in Progress, and Construction. In
Division I. we must direct attention to the
Architect and Engineering Section, which
forms very interesting and instructive reading.
An article also that should be widely read (and
especially so by the members of local boards
and vestries) is that on the “Leyton Pressed
Sludge and Dust Destructor,” by William
Dawson. Such a half-yearly book as this is
cannot fail to be of great benefit to the build-
ing and kindred trades, and we recommend it
accordingly.

MR. WM. CAMERON, a prominent lumberman
and manufacturer of the South-west of the
United States, died at Morgan City, Louisiana,
of apoplexy, on February 6th, aged 65. Mr.
Cameron was born in Perthshire, and at the
age of 14 was apprenticed to an attorney in
Edinburgh. At the age of 18 he emigrated to
New York. His connections in the lumber
trade throughout Texas were very extensive.

PURE v. MIXED FORESTS.—On Friday even-
ing last, Sir Dietrich Brandis, K.C.S.I., LL.D.,
ex-Inspector of Forests in India, delivered an
address on this subject at 5, St. Andrew
Square, Edinburgh, under the auspices of the
Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society. The
Earl of Mansfield, President of the Society,
presided, and there was a large attendance of
foresters, nurserymen, and others interested.
After the lecture questions were invited, a
circumstance which was taken full advantage
of by the audience.
