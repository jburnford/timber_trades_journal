BOSTOCK, WILLIAM, builder, Northwich.—This debtor attended the Crewe Bankruptcy Court on Friday last for his public examination. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £3,655 10s. 4d., of which £863 was expected to rank against the estate for dividend. The assets were estimated at £78 16s. 5d. Replying to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that for some years he was a builder's manager for his father-in-law, but in December, 1897, he commenced business on his own account, with a capital of £100. He had built 17 houses in Oxford Street, 16 in Flower Street, and 2 in Winnington Lane. Mr. Ludwig Mond had advanced him three-fourths of the money to build certain properties on the Hartford Hill estate. He valued the properties on the Hartford Hill Estate at £2,890, and there was a mortgage on them of £2,341. Originally he thought there would be a margin on these properties of several hundred pounds, but he was now afraid that there was no market for these properties. Things were very bad in the district. Two-thirds of the properties were without tenants. Owing to slackness of trade many people had gone to Runcorn. He had lost £100 through voids and rents on empty houses. Unless trade revived, the houses would not be saleable, and there would be no margin over the mortgage. Eventually the examination was ordered to be formally adjourned until the next Court.

BOYD, CHARLES, builder, Ormean Road, Belfast.—At the Belfast Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar M'Cormick, on Monday last, this matter came up on the adjourned examination of witnesses. The bankrupt examined, deposed he had no money in his possession belonging to the estate. He had made no payments to any person since the date of his adjudication. He had received payments since that date for stuff which had been sold. The amount was shown in the cash book, and it might be £200. He had not returned it all to the official assignee. He had none of the money now; he paid it away to those who worked with him. Subsequently, witness said he had made a mistake, as he had sold nothing since his adjudication, nor had he received any money since then. His brokers were the Belfast Banking Company, and they closed his account in August 1898. At the time he took protection he had two contracts on hands. The first was for building two shops on the Springfield Road for Mr. Toner, the amount being £1,060. In the second the contract was for £560, and was for Sir Daniel Dixon. Neither of these contracts were completed. During the year 1898 business was very shaky with him, and a few days before taking protection he had seven writs served on him. In 1898 he borrowed sums of money, the amount of his personal loans

many times been served with writs. His continuing statement of affairs was filed for that afternoon, and the meeting was adjourned until Wednesday.

BRITTAIN, JOHN, builder, 55, Compton Street, Walkley.—This debtor came up for examination before the Official Receiver. His gross liabilities amounted to £449 19s. 3d., and his assets valued at £247 7s. 4d., a surplus on the estate. He began business 16 months ago with John Henry Randall, as joiners and builders. Neither of them had any capital, and the partnership was dissolved in a fortnight. Since that time debtor had been building, working with advances made for the erection of property. He built some houses in Northfield Road and two of them subsided, and that was the beginning of his troubles. The examination was closed.

BROWN, JOHN, builder, Waverley, Long Eaton.—On Tuesday, at Derby, the first meeting was held of the creditors of this debtor. The statement of affairs showed liabilities to be £5,751 5s. 1d., and his deficiency £3,649 2s. 10d. Mr. Hooley's bankruptcy. Mr. T. Leman, of St. Peter's Church Walk, Nottingham, was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection.

COLVILLE, JAMES, builder, Bangor.—At the Belfast Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar M'Cormick, on Monday, this matter came up on the second sitting to consider an offer of composition of 5s. in the £1 payable in three instalments at four, eight, and twelve months respectively. Mr. Samuel Bass appeared for the bankrupt. The offer was passed for the audit.

SAMUEL HANNAM, mason and builder, Old Bilton, near Harrogate.—The accounts filed in this failure show liabilities amounting to £501 7s. 9d., and assets estimated at £276 1s. 3d., thus showing a deficiency of £224 11s. 6d. The debtor states that his insolvency is due to losses on contracts and to accidents to buildings. Since the debtor filed his petition on the 13th ult., he has been examined in relation to his affairs and dealings and the causes of his failure. The debtor, who is a mason and contractor, commenced business at Harrogate about 15 years ago with between £200 and £300 free capital. Owing to a violent wind in 1898, which blew down certain property which was in course of construction, the debtor suffered a considerable loss. A private meeting of creditors was held at Harrogate about 9 months ago, at which a composition of 6s. 8d. in the pound payable in three instalments of 3, 9 and 15 months was accepted. The first payment became due on the 11th ult., and as the debtor was unable to meet it his only alternative was to file a petition in bankruptcy.

NETTLETON, EDWARD, timber contractor, &c., Willingham.—The public examination of the named debtor is fixed on the 10th April at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar M'Cormick. The debtor filed his own petition, and a receiving order was made against him on the 16th March.

SMITH, ERNEST, was a joiner by trade, and in April, 1898, he became a partner with capital. Mr. Hughes at that time had been a draper's assistant, and was out of employment. They met, and it was understood that Mr. Hughes either at the time or was likely to have his deceased mother's will went to the office of a Mr. Thorburn, building land to sell, and an arrangement come to under which the parties entered into and terms agreed on. Mr. Thorburn would sell the land to them and advance them to within 75 per cent. of the value of work done and materials provided. The houses were built in Kingswood Park, Filton, and twenty-six houses were in course of construction in Park Avenue, Fazakerley, when Mr. Thorburn stopped financing them, alleging that he had advanced beyond the terms of the agreement.
