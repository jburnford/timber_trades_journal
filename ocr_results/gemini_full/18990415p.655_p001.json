Howe.\n\nin Whitworth Street, Manchester, when he fell from the fourth floor to the ground, a distance of 50 feet.\nHis fall was broken through his body being caught by the wooden beams.\nHe sustained internal injuries, and his left knee was severely bruised.\nHe had always enjoyed good health, and was most robust prior to the accident.\nMedical evidence was given to the effect that the plaintiff suffered from hemorrhage of the kidneys, and was liable to further complications if he had any illness.\nIt was left to the arbitrator to assess the damages in a lump sum, and he awarded the claimant £120 and costs.\n\nWOOD DECK CARGOES.\nAt West Hartlepool Police Court, on Monday, before the Mayor (Ald. Pyman), F. Evenson, master of the Norwegian barque \"Deodata,\" was charged with an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act.—Mr. Burton, who appeared on behalf of the Board of Trade, stated that the \"Deodata\" left Porsgrund on the 8th March last and arrived at West Hartlepool on the 21st.\nThe offence was the carrying on deck of a number of pieces of timber each exceeding 24 inches in girth.\nPorsgrund was, Mr. Burton added, a port from which there sailed numerous vessels, the masters of which had been convicted in that court, and he submitted that something more than a nominal penalty should therefore be imposed in this case.—Mr. Thompson, Board of Trade surveyor, stated that he inspected the \"Deodata\" on the 23rd March in the Victoria Dock.\nShe had a deck cargo of mining timber, of which he measured altogether 92 pieces, which were each 24 inches and upwards in girth.\nTheir total cubical contents was 515.3 cubic feet.\nOne piece, Mr. Thompson added, was 35 feet long by 25 inches in girth, and another 30 feet long by 26 1/2 inches in girth.\nThe master of the vessel told him that he had been in this trade before during the winter, and he did not know anything at all about the regulation.—Defendant, through an interpreter (Mr. Carl Larsen), now stated that he thought that so long as the deck cargo did not exceed three feet in height it was all right.—The Bench imposed a fine of £10 and costs, 8s. 6d.\n\nA MISDIRECTED CHEQUE.\nAt the Clerkenwell Sessions, on Saturday, before Mr. M'Connell, Q.C., Chairman, Charles Simons, 32, cabinet-maker, was charged with appropriating a banker's cheque, value £9 1s. 6d., the property of Charles Simons.\nThe case was reported in our last issue.\nIt appears that the prosecutor lived in the same street and traded under the same name as the accused and that the cheque was sent to the accused by mistake.\nThe jury came to the conclusion that the accused was not guilty, and he was released.\n\nDOVER.\nApril 10 Frinin-Brunswick-1,013 lds. pitch pine-Crundall & Co.\n\nFLEETWOOD.\nApril 10 Romana-Fredrikstad-988 lds. sawn fir-H. & G.
