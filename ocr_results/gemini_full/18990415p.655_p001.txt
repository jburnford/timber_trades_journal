in Whitworth Street, Manchester, when he fell from the fourth floor to the ground, a distance of 50 feet.
His fall was broken through his body being caught by the wooden beams.
He sustained internal injuries, and his left knee was severely bruised.
He had always enjoyed good health, and was most robust prior to the accident.
Medical evidence was given to the effect that the plaintiff suffered from hemorrhage of the kidneys, and was liable to further complications if he had any illness.
It was left to the arbitrator to assess the damages in a lump sum, and he awarded the claimant £120 and costs.

WOOD DECK CARGOES.
At West Hartlepool Police Court, on Monday, before the Mayor (Ald. Pyman), F. Evenson, master of the Norwegian barque "Deodata," was charged with an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act.—Mr. Burton, who appeared on behalf of the Board of Trade, stated that the "Deodata" left Porsgrund on the 8th March last and arrived at West Hartlepool on the 21st.
The offence was the carrying on deck of a number of pieces of timber each exceeding 24 inches in girth.
Porsgrund was, Mr. Burton added, a port from which there sailed numerous vessels, the masters of which had been convicted in that court, and he submitted that something more than a nominal penalty should therefore be imposed in this case.—Mr. Thompson, Board of Trade surveyor, stated that he inspected the "Deodata" on the 23rd March in the Victoria Dock.
She had a deck cargo of mining timber, of which he measured altogether 92 pieces, which were each 24 inches and upwards in girth.
Their total cubical contents was 515.3 cubic feet.
One piece, Mr. Thompson added, was 35 feet long by 25 inches in girth, and another 30 feet long by 26 1/2 inches in girth.
The master of the vessel told him that he had been in this trade before during the winter, and he did not know anything at all about the regulation.—Defendant, through an interpreter (Mr. Carl Larsen), now stated that he thought that so long as the deck cargo did not exceed three feet in height it was all right.—The Bench imposed a fine of £10 and costs, 8s. 6d.

A MISDIRECTED CHEQUE.
At the Clerkenwell Sessions, on Saturday, before Mr. M'Connell, Q.C., Chairman, Charles Simons, 32, cabinet-maker, was charged with appropriating a banker's cheque, value £9 1s. 6d., the property of Charles Simons.
The case was reported in our last issue.
It appears that the prosecutor lived in the same street and traded under the same name as the accused and that the cheque was sent to the accused by mistake.
The jury came to the conclusion that the accused was not guilty, and he was released.
