The \"Concordia,\" from St. John N.B., has discharged at York-hill Wharf 250 standards spruce deals, considerable deliveries of which are being made ex ship. Per \"Sarmatian,\" from Portland, Me., are 345 logs birch, which, being under contract, are being delivered to consumers. There are also per same liner 50 maple logs. Several small logs of teak are to hand per \"Mandalay,\" from Rangoon, consisting in all of 140 loads, details of which are given in list appended.\nThe \"Kastalia,\" from Baltimore, has landed 70 logs hickory and several consignments of contract oak planks for waggon building purposes, which are being delivered from ship's side.\nThe import this week amounts to about 1,500 loads, and the quantity of hardwoods coming to hand (with the exception of oak planks) has for some time back been of a limited quantity.

The opening of the Quebec season is foreshadowed by the sailing this week from the Clyde of two of the regular liners for Quebec and Montreal.\nA destructive fire occurred on the 8th inst. at the works of the Springfield Chair Co., Millerfield Road, Glasgow. In addition to the loss of the building, a large quantity of wood in process of manufacture was destroyed. The loss is estimated at £4,000.\n\nLEITH.\nThe week's arrivals are limited to 24,900 oak staves, and 78 wainscot logs per s.s \"Ravenna,\" from Libau, and 32 fathoms firewood per \"Rosa & Polly,\" from Tvedestrand.\nThere is no new feature to report in the trade this week; the demand continues steady, and the prospects of a busy year are fairly good. The only cloud in the immediate future is a demand for increased wages on the part of the joiners in the Edinburgh and Leith district under threat of a strike.\n\nAPRIL 15, 1899.\nMackellar & [?]\n\nJAMES KENNEDY & CO.,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchants,\n69, BUCHANAN STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"LIGNUM, GLASGOW.\"\n\nLOVE & STEWART, LIMITED.\nPitwood Importers & Coal Exporters,\n140, HOPE STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"LOVART.\" Telephone No. 1601.\n\nBUCHANAN & FRENCH,\nHome & Foreign Timber Merchants and Saw-millers,\nAlbert Saw Mills, RENFREW.\nAnd 52, St. Enoch Square, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address: \"WAINSCOT, GLASGOW & RENFREW.\"\n\nM.

It is sincerely to be hoped that such a misfortune to the trade will be avoided.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN\nApril 4 Cremona-Riga-80 lds. deals &c.—J.
