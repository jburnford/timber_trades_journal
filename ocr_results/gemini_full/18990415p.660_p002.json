The funeral took place in the churchyard, Ballater, on Wednesday last.\n\nNEW IRON BUILDING FOR LOCAL SHIPYARD.\nMessrs. Scott & Co., shipbuilders, Greenock, have placed an order with the Clyde Structural Iron Company (Limited), Scotstoun, for a large new building to take the place of the buildings recently destroyed by fire in their east yard.\n\nTelephone No. 687.\nTEAK CIRCULAR.\nMessrs. Denny, Mott, and Dickson, report that the landings in the London Docks during March consisted of 1,933 loads of logs and 326 loads of planks, aggregating 2,259 loads, against 1,515 loads of logs and 395 loads of planks and small scantling delivered from the docks into consumption.\nThe landings during the first quarter of the year total 3,551 loads, as against a total delivery into consumption of 5,681 loads, and the dock stocks on 31st March analyse as follows:—\n1899 | 1898\nLogs | 7,410 lds. of logs, as against | 12,517 lds.\nPlanks | 3,477 „ plks. | 3,383 „\nBlks. | 26 „ blks. | 14 „\n--- | --- | ---\n| 10,913 lds. | | 15,914 lds.\n\nThe above consumption for the three months falls some 54 per cent. below that for the corresponding period of last year, but the striking fact remains that it is nevertheless 60 per cent. in excess of the imports, as shown by the above figures. The present landed stocks, however, may be considered quite sufficient to supply all likely wants during the next quarter of the year, during which time a fair share of the present modest floating supplies will doubtless find its way to this market. In the meantime, all holders of landed stocks and floating supplies are well placed, although it would be unwise to over-estimate the strength of a position which is based upon a continuance of the increased rate of consumption during the last few years, which expansion is largely, although not entirely, owing to the demand from all quarters for warships, and this demand may be appreciably diminished by the increasing disposition on the part of foreign governments to minimize the use of inflammable material in such ships, and also by the checking of unduly swelling armaments by some understanding between England and the other great naval powers, as recently adumbrated by the First Lord of the Admiralty.\nIn order to develop the healthily growing disposition to use teak for general purposes other than ship and rolling-stock construction, artificial values are to be deprecated, and it is for the merchant and dealer, as well as the consumer, to do all possible to discourage the ever-growing disposition of both the Burmese and Bangkok foresters to force up prices. The present level is still reasonable, but if further raised it will inevitably tend to decrease the consumption for domestic and general purposes.\n\nTHE COAL-MINING INDUSTRY IN FIFE.\nThe Fife coal-mines, from which are raised annually about five million tons of coal, consume a yearly average of approximately the following amount of pit-wood, viz.:—\n| Equivalent in solid cubic feet measurement.\nImported wood, almost entirely spruce and Scots fir coming chiefly from Baltic ports | 23,750,000\nHome-grown wood, chiefly Scots fir and spruce, from the north of Scotland | 1,250,000\n--- | ---\nTotals | 25,000,000\n\nThe description of wood preferred for the mines consists of:—\nRound fir \"props,\" which run from 2 feet to 6 feet in length; the most suitable size being 3 inches at the smaller end.\nRound fir \"bars,\" which vary in length from 6 feet to 9 feet; they should have a diameter of from 4 inches to 6 inches at the smaller end.\nSleepers, which measure from 2 feet 6 inches to 2 feet 9 inches in length, with a cross section of 5 inches by 2½ inches, and are sawn from butt-ends which are too thick for props or bars. By far the larger quantity of timber used is in the form of \"props.\"\nThe wood delivered to the mines from the Raith Estate is, for the most part, beech, elm, and other hardwoods of rough quality, sawn out of tops and branches into pieces from 2½ feet to 4 feet in length, and 3 inches by 3 inches in cross-section. The miners do not much like this class of wood, as it is comparatively heavy, and is difficult to handle on account of splinters. They prefer the imported wood, because, being better seasoned, it is lighter, it has a smoother surface and a more uniform thickness, it is free from knots, and it is also stronger, on account of the narrowness of its annual rings. They prefer spruce, because that species excels Scots fir in most of the above qualities. For imported round spruce and Scots fir props and bars delivered at the mines, the average rate now paid amounts to 4s. 1½d. per hundred linear feet, which is equal to 8d. per (quarter-girth) cubic foot. Wood of the same species, brought for the most part from the north of Scotland by sea, in the form of pit-lengths or long round poles, and partially squared with the axe, to reduce bulk and weight during transport, is paid for at an average rate of 3s. 3s. per hundred linear feet, delivered at the mines; this rate amounts to about 6d. per (quarter-girth) cubic foot, which would represent a price of 5l. in the Raith woods. This timber is not so well seasoned as that which is imported from abroad, and it is therefore heavier; it is also of a much rougher quality. For the rough sawn wood from the Raith Estate, the price now paid at the pit's mouth amounts to about 2s. 7d. per hundred linear feet, or 5d. per (quarter-girth) cubic foot, which represents from 3d. to 3½d. in the forest. A few years ago, the prices paid were higher than this.\n[Hugh Macdonald, Raith Estate, Kirkcaldy. From The Transactions of the Royal Scottish Agricultural Society.]\n\nESTABLISHED 1852.
