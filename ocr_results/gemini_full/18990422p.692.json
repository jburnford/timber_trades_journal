Denny & Bros., shipbuilders, Dumbarton, speaking at a meeting of the Dumbarton Social Union on Tuesday evening alluded to the unsteadiness and thriftlessness of workmen. In Dumbarton, he said, the sanitary conditions, so far as regarded new houses (the subject under discussion), must have been greatly improved, but there was one point filling the minds of many of them with dismay—the present unsteadiness prevailing among some sections of workmen during the present time of prosperity. For instance, instead of resuming work the day after Dumbarton spring holiday, a great proportion of the ironmen in the firm with which he was connected had not returned to work, and the chances were that the following day would still find them in the streets, mis-spending both their time and money. Housing might help to some extent to solve the problem before them, but in Dumbarton it was not the houses so much as what they should do to bring about a steadier type of workman in some of the departments. In slack times the men were both steadier and more reasonable, but at the present moment, when busy times brought a large amount of unsteadiness and thriftlessness, it made a good many of them who had the town's interest at heart feel sore and dispirited. Dumbarton was perhaps unique in Scotland in having a district of the town in which probably three-fourths of the whole of the houses were owned by the men who lived in them, and also in that particular ward there was not a licensed public-house. But the fact remained that at the present moment, among a good many of the men there was more unsteadiness than there had been in his experience of 27 years. He had had special reasons for looking into this, because they had been trying to work against promised deliveries. He had taken in the last 12 months a close and keen oversight at the attendance of their men. That (Tuesday) morning all the heads of squads turned out, but the work was not gone on with through want of men. It meant a loss of about £400 worth of wages that would have been earned that day in the iron department, and the deliveries to that extent were thrown back.\n\nSCOTCH LABOUR TROUBLES.\nTHE JOINERS' DISPUTE.—At a general meeting of Edinburgh and Leith joiners, held in the Oddfellows' Hall last Friday night, to consider the decision of the Master Builders' Association adhering to their resolution not to rise the wages ½d. per hour, a motion in favour of a general strike was carried almost unanimously.\n\nCAMERON BROTHERS\nTIMBER IMPORTERS AND SAW-MILLERS,\nPERTH SAW-MILLS, PERTH.\nBRANCH YARD AT NEWBURGH.\nTELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS—\"BROTHERS, PERTH.\"\n\n******************************************************\nELLIMAN'S ROYAL EMBROCATION\nAN EXCELLENT THING\nECONOMY IN THE STABLE.\nUSING ELLIMAN'S EASIER HAULAGE\nHorses, Dogs, Birds, Cattle\nACCIDENTS & AILMENTS\nTHE ELLIMAN FIRST AID BOOK\nBOTTLES 2/- 2/6, 3/6\nJARS 10/6, 20/-\nNO HORSES KEPT WITHOUT BIRDS' SECTION\nPrepared only by ELLIMAN, SONS & Co., SLOUGH, ENGLAND.\nCopy &c., post free, of the label of a 6d. bottle, may be had.\nPublished by Elliman, Sons & Co., Slough.\n******************************************************\n\nAPRIL 22, 1899.\n\nDUMFRIES.\nTIMBER INTERDICT.—Interim Sheriff Pringle on Saturday issued an interlocutor in an action against the judgment of the Sheriff-Substitute in the action at the instance of Robert Clark of Speddoch against Messrs. A. & R. [?] & Sons, timber merchants, Maxwelltown, in which he sued for £97 12s. in name of damages for removing 224 standing larch trees under a contract for the purchase of these trees. The Sheriff-Substitute decided that defenders were not to remove any timber they had not already removed, and assoilzied them; but on the appeal the principal recalls that decision, and finds that the defenders were only entitled to the timber, and gives decree for the sum sued for, with expenses.\n\nF.
