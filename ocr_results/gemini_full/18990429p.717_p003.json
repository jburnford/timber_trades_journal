At the statutory meeting of creditors it was stated that the debtor had not surrendered under the proceedings as required by the Act, and that consequently no statement of affairs had been lodged. Eventually it was decided to appoint Mr. Joseph Henry Scott, accountant of Liverpool, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection.\n\nPAYNE, JAMES, builder, 31, Bury Road, Hemel Hempstead.—The Official Receiver for the St. Alban's district has issued particulars under this failure from which it appears that the debtor has filed a statement of affairs showing gross liabilities amounts to £3,031 18s. 10d., of which £994 6s. 7d. is due to unsecured creditors. To fully secured creditors £2,649, the value of the securities being returned at £2,679, thus leaving a balance of £30 which is carried to contra as an asset. The total liabilities expected to rank for dividend are returned at £994 6s. 7d. The assets are returned at £312 5s. 0d. from which £8 12s. 3d. has to be deducted for the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaving nett assets at £203 12s. 9d., and disclosing a deficiency of £790 13s. 10d. The only cause of insolvency given by the debtor is the loss of an action brought by him, in which he was unsuccessful and costs thereby incurred. The Official Receiver is obtaining further particulars in reference to this matter, having regard to the large deficiency shewn by the statement of affairs.\n\nPETERS & SON, builders, East Street, Horsham.—The adjourned public examination of the above named debtor came on for hearing at the Brighton Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week. Mr. Mackintosh appeared for the trustee, and Mr. A. Carrington for a creditor (Mr. Belcher). The Registrar said he understood the Official Receiver practically finished his examination at the last hearing. Debtor was now questioned by Mr. Mackintosh. He said he did not own any furniture, having settled it on his wife by deed of gift when he married in August, 1897. Its value was put at £500, but it was not anything like so much. Mr. Mackintosh said it appeared from the books that within the last twelve months debtor has drawn £40,000 for wages, and had only paid away £28,000, a discrepancy according to the trustee of £12,000. Debtor said that could not possibly be. Did you ever draw sums under the heading of wages and use the money for some other purposes? Debtor: No; the wages and time sheet ought to tally with that amount. It may be that the sum included wages paid for the brickyard which I sold in September last. Questioned as to his private expenses debtor said he drew a good deal more last year than ever before, on account of the ill-health of his wife. Perhaps it was £1,000. Pressed by Mr. Mackintosh to give an account of his private expenses for the past two years, debtor said he could not do so. Mr. Mackintosh: I shall ask the Registrar to direct you to do it. He applied for an adjournment in order that a cash and goods account for the past two years should be filed by the debtor. The Registrar further adjourned the examination to May 17th, leaving the preparation of the account to the Official Receiver.\n\nROBINSON, JOSEPH, builder, 126, Upper Hanover Street, Sheffield. The public examination of this debtor was fixed for Thursday last, at the Sheffield Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Binney, but upon the application of the Official Receiver the examination was adjourned until the next Court.\n\nGOYNE, RICHARD FRANCIS, timber merchant, Bromsgrove Street, Birmingham.—Liabilities £2,148, assets nil. The bankrupt, in answer to the Official Receiver, at the Birmingham Bankruptcy Court on Friday last, said he had no assets except what might be derived from a frost-proof patent pipe, a pipe which the frost expanded and did not burst. He had paid £100 for Non-Collapsible Tyre shares, which were now worthless. He had lost money on other share transactions. He owed £472 to the North European Cycle Company, and £1,000 to the City Bank.—The examination was concluded.\n\nSMITH, ERNEST EDWARD, timber merchant, &c., Chatham.—The public examination of this debtor took place on Monday at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Smith and the Official Receiver (Mr. Richard T. Tatham). Debtor was represented by Mr. John L. Allen, solicitor (of the firm of Messrs. Winch, Son & Allen, Chatham). Debtor's gross liabilities as scheduled amount to £2,548 14s. 2d., of which £864 4s. 3d. represents unsecured creditors, including Messrs. Bessent & Son, timber and slate merchants, High Street, Chatham, £29 17s.; Mr. Wm. C. Snow (of New Brompton), trading at Chatham as the Chatham Timber Company, £194;",
