CENTRAL SAW-MILLS, GALLOWGATE, Glasgow. Floorings, Linings, Mouldings, Architraves\n\nLEITH.\nThe arrivals this week consist merely of 9,225 battens per \"Johanne,\" from Kragero ; 10,746 deals and battens per \"Adjutor,\" from Arendal ; 22,526 deals and battens per \"Moidart,\" from Riga ; 32,061 oak staves and 150 deals per \"Buda,\" from Danzig.\nOwing to the joiners' strike the delivery of wood this week have been restricted, and if this interruption of work in Edinburgh and Leith district is continued the slackness in deliveries will become more pronounced.\nA strike has been avoided in Glasgow by the employers giving in to the joiners, but so far as can be ascertained there is no appearance in this district of such a concession, and the men seem to be equally determined.\nUnder such circumstances, it is feared that no settlement can be looked for for some time.\nWm. Fergus & Co. held a public sale on Tuesday, 25th inst., to inaugurate new premises which they have acquired recently owing to being dispossessed by railway operations.\nThere was a good attendance and a fair quantity of ent wood and cartwrights' material was disposed of, the influence of the joiners' strike not being much felt in those departments.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nApril 22 Nickoline-Carlshamn-8 lds. firewood-J. & A.

The damage is estimated at several hundred pounds, and this is partly covered by insurance.\n\nSHIPYARD EXTENSION AT DUMBARTON.\nDenny & Bros. presented a petition stating that were proprietors of the piece of ground known as the Barge Park, and were desirous of erecting thereon a fitters' shed in connection with their yard.\n\nSALE OF SAW-MILL STOCKS AND PLANT.\nThe trustees of the late Mr. Martin, wood merchant, of Carluke, Lanarkshire, has given instructions to sell by auction, on Monday next, the stock-in-trade of the saw-mills at Carluke, and plant, comprising wood working machinery and other material for saw-mill work.
