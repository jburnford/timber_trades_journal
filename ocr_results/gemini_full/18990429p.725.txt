LEITH.
The arrivals this week consist merely of 9,225 battens per "Johanne," from Kragero ; 10,746 deals and battens per "Adjutor," from Arendal ; 22,526 deals and battens per "Moidart," from Riga ; 32,061 oak staves and 150 deals per "Buda," from Danzig.
Owing to the joiners' strike the delivery of wood this week have been restricted, and if this interruption of work in Edinburgh and Leith district is continued the slackness in deliveries will become more pronounced.
A strike has been avoided in Glasgow by the employers giving in to the joiners, but so far as can be ascertained there is no appearance in this district of such a concession, and the men seem to be equally determined.
Under such circumstances, it is feared that no settlement can be looked for for some time.
Wm. Fergus & Co. held a public sale on Tuesday, 25th inst., to inaugurate new premises which they have acquired recently owing to being dispossessed by railway operations.
There was a good attendance and a fair quantity of ent wood and cartwrights' material was disposed of, the influence of the joiners' strike not being much felt in those departments.

OBITUARY.
ROBERT BEATTIE.
The death occurred on Thursday last week of Mr. Robert Beattie, builder, at his residence, Burnside-road, Westburn. The deceased was 59 years of age.

ALEXANDER LOW.
Many of our readers will learn with regret of the death of Mr. Low. He was long resident in the port of Glasgow, and although taking no active part in public affairs he became widely known, his position as manager to Thomas Lamb & Son, saw-millers, bringing him into close contact with many in the community. He was of a retiring disposition and highly respected. The body was interred in Greenock cemetery on Tuesday last.

FIRE AT DUNDEE.
A two-storey building situated in Bell Street, Dundee, and occupied by D. Ogilvie & Son, joiners and cartwrights, caught fire on Monday afternoon. The fire was discovered by a lad, who heard a cracking noise inside, and immediately summoned the fire brigade, who extinguished the outbreak in about 20 minutes. The interior of the building was almost totally destroyed, while the roof was much charred. The damage is estimated at several hundred pounds, and this is partly covered by insurance.

SHIPYARD EXTENSION AT DUMBARTON.
Denny & Bros. presented a petition stating that were proprietors of the piece of ground known as the Barge Park, and were desirous of erecting thereon a fitters' shed in connection with their yard.
