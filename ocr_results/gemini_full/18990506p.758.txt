LEITH.
There is a longer list of arrivals this week,
consisting of 1,435 pieces oak, 494 pieces
poplar, 262 bundles poplar lumber, 11,000
deals and battens per “Anna,” from Riga;
deals, &c., per “Vesta,” from Namsos;
oak staves and 2,053 logs per “Urania,”
from Libau, 98 1/2 fathoms firewood per “Insula”
from Kragero, 403 bundles poplar
and 262 bundles poplar lumber per “Saint Enoch” from New-
port News; 13,195 deals and 97,740 pcs. sleepers per
“Express,” from Memel;
The dispute in the building trade at
Edinburgh and Leith joiners still con-
tinues, and there is no immediate prospect
of any settlement of work. The ill-
effect of the stoppage of work in the district
is being more strongly felt in the tim-
ber trade each succeeding week. At the
public sale held by D. W. Beattie on the
2nd inst., at the Edinburgh and Leith Saw
Mills, the consequence of this interruption was
very apparent in the limited attendance and
the slackness of demand, although, on the whole,

prices of Baltic deals and battens were fairly
well sustained.
