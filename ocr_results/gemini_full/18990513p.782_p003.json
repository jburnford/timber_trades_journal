H., timber merchants, 57, Gracechurch Street, E.C. The debtors filed their own petition, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday, before Mr. E. L. Hough, Official Receiver. Mr. E. H. Barton, senr., stated that he commenced business as a timber merchant about 1889, but had no office until 1892, when he took one at 57, Gracechurch Street, E.C. About 1895 or 1896 he took his son, E. H. Barton, junr., into partnership. When he started in 1889 he had a capital of £300 or £400, and it was increased to £1,800 when he took his son into partnership. The debtor further stated that he had previously failed in about 1873, when trading under the firm of Edward Barton and Sons, packing case makers, and received his discharge in 1874. The present failure was attributed to the inability of the debtors to meet their acceptances falling due in the present month, amounting to £3,000 or £4,000, without sacrificing their stock-in-trade; to loss sustained in 1897 by fall in the prices of timber (about £2,000); and to bad debts since 1897, amounting to £2,000. The proofs of debt having been dealt with, the Official Receiver reported that a statement of affairs had been lodged, but it was not yet examined, and it showed ranking liabilities £13,118, but this would probably be increased to the extent of £4,000 or £5,000 by claims on timber, firewood, and other contracts which were now pending. The assets were estimated at £11,939. It appeared to him to be desirable that a trustee should be appointed without delay, so that the estate might be properly represented. A number of contracts were open, and he had impressed upon the debtors that if they intended to make a proposal there should be no delaying the matter. Mr. McKay, representing the debtors, said he quite appreciated the chairman's opinion that there should be no unnecessary delay; but he might state that negotiations had recently taken place, with every prospect of success, with a view to putting an end to the forward contracts. If they could be cancelled it would certainly be for the benefit of the creditors, and he was informed that this would be consented to, provided that some scheme could be carried without the estate going into bankruptcy. He suggested therefore that there should be an adjournment of at least a fortnight. The chairman pointed out that in the meantime the estate would not be represented, and there would be no one in a position to deal with the parties, whom, he understood, were willing to cancel the contracts. Mr. McKay submitted that there was no practical difficulty in the matter, and that it would be most undesirable for the creditors to resolve upon bankruptcy if some arrangement could be come to, so as to get rid of the heavy liabilities on pending contracts. The chairman, however, adhered to his opinion that it would be unwise for the creditors to adjourn the meeting. He thought it would be better to appoint a trustee, and for the debtors then to come forward, and buy back the estate if they were able to do so by means of a scheme under section 23 of the Act. The appointment of a trustee who would be in a position to deal with the estate as quickly as possible was very desirable, as his powers as Official Receiver were very limited. What he understood was that the contracts on hand were not of a profitable nature, and that whatever arrangement might be made, some claim was sure to be made against the estate. In reply to questions, Mr. Barton, senr., said that the firm had been in the habit of making up yearly balance sheets. The last one prepared was at the end of 1898, and it showed about £800 to the good. It was only a week or two ago when they first became aware that they were insolvent, and they had not bought goods since. Some discussion ensued, and Mr. Overton moved an adjournment. Mr. Schrader (Churchill & Sim) moved that the estate be administered in bankruptcy. This latter motion was carried, and Mr. E. W. Bayne, of Leadenhall Street, E.C., was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Wm. Goff (Messrs. Dobell & Co.), Mr. Steer (Cheeswright & Co.), Mr. I. H. Crow & Son), Mr. R. J. Benn, and Mr. R. J. Pitwood Co.

W., builder, Lepton[?].—This case was noticed in our last issue. At the adjourned meeting of creditors, held on Tuesday, before Mr. A. C. Bourner, of Bush Lane House, E.C., was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection.\nBRADLEY, GEORGE WILLIAM, builder, Mansfield.—This debtor came up for his public examination on Friday, before the Registrar Speed, at the Nottingham Bankruptcy Court. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed liabilities amounting to £1,204 4s. 8d., and assets estimated at £1,125 1s. 11d. He commenced business in Mansfield about May, 1892, in partnership with Mr. Rowe. He had about £25 or £30. The partnership was dissolved about May, 1895, the debtor taking the assets and assuming the liabilities. There were very little assets, and the firm, the liabilities exceeding them by £600. The examination was closed.\n\nMAY 13, 1899.\nM. C. DAVIDSON & CO.\n3, GRACECHURCH STREET, E.C.\nCABLES AND TELEGRAMS: \"JARRAH, LONDON.\"\nFor Sanitary Slabs, Railway Sleepers, Building Timber, &c.\nBULLOCK, JOHN TITUS, builder and contractor, East Ardsley. This debtor appeared for his public examination at the Wakefield Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Mason, on Thursday, last week, upon a statement of affairs showing a deficiency of £116. Debtor stated that his failure had been caused through unprofitable contracts, and illness of himself and family. The examination was closed.\nBURR, JOHN THOMAS, builder, Hertford Road, Lower Edmonton, lately carrying on business at St. Mary's Road, Maddin Estate, Lower Edmonton. The Official Receiver for the Edmonton District has now issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the debtor has filed a statement of affairs showing gross liabilities amounting to £3332 9s. 8d., of which £3332 9s. 8d. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend. The assets are returned as nil, and the deficiency at £3332 9s. 8d. The debtor attributes his position to want of capital, to loss sustained in the building of the houses on the Maddin Estate and to his inability to obtain equipment since August last. He accounts for his deficiency of £3332 9s. 8d. by debts contracted in connection with house building at Edmonton, and states \"the whole amount of the liabilities has been incurred at St. Mary's Road property and sunk in the buildings.\"\nFORSE, A., trading as Forse Bros., builder, Leigh-on-Sea. This debtor appeared for his public examination at the Chelmsford Bankruptcy Court, last week. Liabilities £498, and assets £11. He commenced business at Margate in 1894 as a house decorator with a capital of £40. The greater portion of the liabilities were contracted at Leigh. He never kept any books of account. He was aware that a Mr. Woodridge had disputed his account, and he was not surprised. The case was adjourned until June 7th.\nHOLLAND, FRANK HENRY, builder, Chichester Cottages, Ashey Road, Ryde, Isle of Wight. The statement of affairs files shows liabilities £929 9s. 10d., gross liabilities £587 1s. 8d. is expected to rank for dividend, and assets estimated to produce £209 10s. 3d., less preferential creditors £24 13s. 10d., net assets £184 16s. 5d., deficiency £402 5s. 3d. The bankrupt attributes his failure to losses on contracts.\nSHERWOOD, GEORGE EDWARD, joiner and builder, trading at Tuft's Lane, Cleckheaton, under the style of Isherwood & Co. The first meeting of the creditors concerned in this failure took place at the offices of the Official Receiver, Bradford, on Tuesday. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed liabilities amounting to £471, and assets estimated to produce £152, thus leaving a deficiency of £319. Eventually, the matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration in the bankruptcy.\nTOMKINS, FRED'K., haulier and building material dealer, The Farm, Montpelier, Bristol. The statement of affairs shows liabilities £3,505, of which £3,505 are secured; the unsecured liabilities amounted to £535 10s. 7d., and the assets are £136 0s. 7d. The Official Receiver stated at the meeting that he had been appointed trustee to the estate.\nLUCAS, ARTHUR ERNEST, timber merchant, trading as Lucas & Co., 98, Uxbridge Road, West Ealing.
