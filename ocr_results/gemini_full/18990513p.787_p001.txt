TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
There is very little to report this week in the way of arrivals. This is generally the case when the liners are being transferred from other routes to Montreal and Quebec, the first arrivals per the "Allan" and "Donaldson" lines from these ports being due here early next week, and are expected to bring a large number of consignments of deals. The only import of note is per "Ava," from Rangoon, with a large quantity of teak for various consignees, amounting to over 1,200 loads logs and 400 loads planks, scantling, etc. A considerable portion of these have been discharged at Greenock, which, having adjacent to the storage ponds, saves sending the logs down the river again in rafts, as has to be done when they are discharged here. The planks have been discharged at Glasgow, and a considerable portion is having been sold to arrive, deliveries are already going on ex quay. The demand for planks is good. Macgregor & Co., Rangoon, are reported to have secured the greater part of the con-

tract for teak for the supply to Her Majesty's Government.
Deliveries from hardwoods recently landed per "Salacia," from Baltimore, and "Indrani," from Newport News, have been made to a very satisfactory extent from ship's side, and a considerable demand continues for furniture woods. A parcel of fair round mahogany from Boston, which has come to hand via Liverpool, has been sold to merchants ex quay. There is an almost unprecedented scarcity of mahogany in this market, and the enquiry is good.

LEITH.
The arrivals this week consist of 27,031 pieces lathwood per "Calabria," from Riga, 125 fathoms firewood per "Griqua," from Risoer, 17,585 deals and battens and 5,370 pieces lathwood per "Ennismore," from Riga, 5,655 deals and battens per "Phoenix," from Skien, 62 fathoms firewood per "Anthon," from Drammen, 594 fathoms firewood per "Oscar," from Drammen, 2,351 pieces white pine lumber per "Laura," from New York, and 221 deals per "Tronda," Drontheim.
There is no change to report in the state of trade this week, the joiners' strike is still with us, and its effect is being increasingly felt in the town. There was a public sale of American and Baltic wood held by Garland & Roger, Ltd., at their Bath Road yard on Tuesday, 9th inst., and the small representation of the town buyers was generally remarked, although there was a fair attendance of country buyers. The bidding was not very brisk, and although fair prices were got for what was sold of odd sizes, the quantity disposed of was disappointing. A number of balances and odd lots were cleared out "without reserve," and in consequence of bad weather the sale concluded early.
