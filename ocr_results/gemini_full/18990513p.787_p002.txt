OBITUARY.
HUGH MACPHERSON.
On Monday evening, Ex-Provost MacPherson died suddenly at Crieff Hydropathic, where he had been residing about ten days. Deceased, was about 66 years of age, was a native of Polmont, and was the principal partner of the firm of Messrs. MacPherson and McLaren, timber merchants and saw-millers, Grangemouth. Mr. MacPherson was a man of shrewd business ability, and this is borne out by his successful career. Entering the office of the late Mr. Robert Melville, timber merchant, Falkirk, he acquired an excellent knowledge of business, and in 1863 he along with Mr. D. A. McLaren, Avondhu, established the firm of Messrs. MacPherson & McLaren, Grangemouth. Subsequently to this, Mr. John Fairley, of Avonhall, was assumed as a partner. The venture was a most successful one, the success being largely attributed to the keen business ability of the deceased. The firm, a few years ago, was formed into a private limited liability company.
Deceased was a gentleman who took a deep interest in all schemes for the local government of the people. For sixteen years he was a member of the Grangemouth Police Commissioners, and for five successive terms he held the honoured position of chief magistrate of the burgh. He was a member of the Grangemouth School Board for fifteen years, and during a couple of terms held the position of chairman. He was a Justice of the Peace for Stirlingshire, a member of the County Council, and for over forty years was one of the managers of the Falkirk Savings Bank.
In 1891, Mr. MacPherson removed to Falkirk, and at that time the inhabitants, in recognition of the valuable services he had rendered to the burgh of Grangemouth, publicly presented him with a life-size portrait of himself, painted by Mr. Jas. Guthrie, R.S.A., Glasgow. Deceased was also a member of the Falkirk Burgh School Board, and in 1854 he was one of the band of young men who formed the Falkirk Young Men's Christian Association. In 1868, he formed the Grangemouth Y.M.C.A. He was interested in almost every religious institution in the district, and was a good friend to the town Mission, of which he was a director.
Deceased was twice married and is survived by his widow and family of one son and two daughters.
GEORGE LOVE.
At Falkenberg, Sweden, whither he had gone to attend to the firm's business, Mr. George Love, son of Mr. Robert Love, of Love, Stewart & Co., timber merchants, Glasgow and Boness, died last week. He was seized with a severe attack of inflammation of the lungs, and after a few days' illness he died very unexpectedly. Deceased, who was 25 years of age, was a young man of much promise, and he will be much missed by the firm and all connected with it. The funeral took place at Falkenberg last Thursday.
