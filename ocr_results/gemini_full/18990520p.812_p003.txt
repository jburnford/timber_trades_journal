BAKER, FRANCIS J., builder, Hill [?]

BENNETT, JOSEPH, builder and contractor, 2, John Street, Edgware Road, W., and the Steam Joinery Works, Dyne Road, Kilburn.—The debtor lately carried on business as above, and the receiving order was made against him upon the petition of Lindsay, Neale & Co., Ld., of Paddington. The first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday, before Mr. E. L. Hough, Official Receiver. Proofs amounting to £5,565 were lodged, the creditors including the following:—

The Official Receiver reported that the debtor had not surrendered, and that no accounts had been lodged. The act of bankruptcy was the departure of the debtor with the intent to defeat or delay creditors, and his present address was not known. He had been adjudicated a bankrupt, and the creditors would now proceed to appoint a trustee and committee of inspection. Mr. Perks and Mr. Hobson attended on behalf of creditors. Resolutions were passed for the appointment of Mr. R. G. West, accountant, Clement's Inn, as trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection consisting of Mr. B. E. Holland (Lindsay, Neale & Co., Ltd.), Mr. C. Gillingham, Mr. F. Parker, Mr. W. Browne (New Peterborough Brick Company), and Mr. Fowler. No definite information was yet forthcoming with regard to the value of the assets, but the bond to be given by the trustee was fixed at £600.
