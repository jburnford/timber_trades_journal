Ferguson & Co., Eglinton Saw Mills, Glasgow, a meeting of the above firm's principal creditors was recently held, when states of affairs were submitted, as given below, and a committee of five creditors appointed to act with them meantime in regard to the conduct of affairs. Mr. Stewart, sole partner of the insolvent firm, was allowed a fortnight to make an offer of composition, and they will immediately, on the expiry of that date, convene the committee, and intimate to every creditor the result. Meantime, a trust deed has been taken in favour of Mr. Hodge, so as to preserve the general interests of the creditors. The statement of affairs is as follows :-\nLIABILITIES.\n£ s. d\nCreditors as per List ... ... 16,865 9 9\nRoyal Bank ... ... ... 9 13 2\nLiability for bills discounted ... 1,000 0 0\n---\n17,875 2 11\nASSETS.\nStock as per inventory ... ... 4,637 2 0\nBook debts ... £4,479 7 11\nLess discount ... 379 7 11\n---\n4,100 0 0\nCash in hand ... ... ... 477 12 7\nBills receivable ... ... ... 63 8 10\nReversion from properties, £775\nLien held over this by Kyle and Hurry ...\nLife policy, £1,000 held by M'Dowall and Nielson ...\nDeficit ... ... ... 9,278 3 5\n... ... ... 8,596 19 6\n---\n17,875 2 11\nOr 10/3 1/4 per £ as a going business.\n\nLast Friday, A. D. Cowie, partner of the firm of Stevenson & Cowie, timber merchants and coal exporters, Bo'ness, was examined in bankruptcy at Linlithgow. After Mr. Cowie had submitted a statement of his affairs, and explained his position, the examination was formally adjourned till 2nd July next.\n\nOBITUARY.\n—\nMALCOLM DUNN.\nWe very much regret to have to record the sudden death, on the 9th inst., of Mr Malcolm Dunn, of Dalkeith, one of the foremost and most enthusiastic arboriculturists in Scotland. In 1872 he was appointed Vice-President of the Royal Scottish Aboricultural Society, and did much useful work to bring that useful institution to its present high position. The success of the Forestry Exhibition at Edinburgh in 1874 was mainly due to Mr. Malcolm Dunn's untiring energy and boundless enthusiasm. He had been for many years a constant contributor to the agricultural and horticultural press, and was for some years the editor of the now defunct \"Journal of Forestry.\" In 1870 Mr. Dunn undertook the superintendence of the Palace Gardens, Dalkeith, and he remained in the service of the Duke of Buccleugh up to the time of his decease.\n\nGARLAND AND ROGER, LTD.\nAt the first annual meeting of the shareholders of Garland & Roger, Ltd., timber merchants, Leith, held at the offices of the company, Bath Road, Leith, under the presidency of Mr. James Roger, managing director, the chairman, in moving the adoption of the report and accounts, stated that since the formation of the company in October last a nett profit had been made of £2,448, after deducting the managing director's salary and charges for interest and expenses. It was proposed to apply this profit to the payment of a dividend of 5 per cent. on the preference shares, and 8 per cent. on the ordinary shares, and of £1,022 to be carried forward to next year. The Chairman spoke hopefully of the profits of the company during the coming year, and said the valuation of the stock was several thousand sands less in the balance-sheet than in the books of the company, and an ample sum had been written off for depreciation. Mr. Arnot seconded, and the report was adopted unanimously.\n\nTHE LATE PROVOST STEWART.\nAll the subscriptions towards the public testimonial to Provost Stewart, in recognition of his services to the town have now been received and amount to about £100. The committee will meet shortly to decide what form the presentation shall take. As is well known, Provost Stewart is one of the partners of the firm of Love & Stewart, timber merchants, Bo'ness and Glasgow.\n\nTHE OPENING OF THE NEW POST OFFICE AT GREENOCK.\nThe removal of the Post Office fittings, etc., from Wallace Square to the new building in Cathcart Street, which was to have taken place between Saturday and Monday, has been postponed for a week. It has been arranged that the new office will be opened for public business on Monday, the 22nd. The connecting of the various wires will be completed on the Sunday previous, so as to minimise the inconvenience to the public.\n\nF. A.
