W., builder, Leytonstone.—This case has been already reported, and the sitting for public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The bankrupt, who attributed his failure to loss on contracts through the increase in the price of building materials and wages, returned unsecured debts at £1,091 9s. 9d., and debts fully secured £1,269 12s. 7d., with assets which are valued £260 12s. 5d., including an estimated surplus of £213 7s. 5d. from securities held by creditors. The examination was closed.\nBUCKLE, J. C., builder, North Kensington and Shepherd's Bush.—The debtor filed his petition for liquidation in August, 1880, and he applied on Wednesday to Mr. Registrar Giffard for an order of discharge. The accounts showed unsecured debts £4,756 7s. 11d., and debts fully secured £6,825, against assets £1,765 17s. 3d. It was resolved that the estate should be liquidated by arrangement, and two trustees and a committee of inspection were appointed. The present application was made under the provisions of the Bankruptcy (Discharge and Closure) Act, and no opposition being offered by creditors, the discharge was granted.\nCUMMINS, M. J., builder, 5, Oakhurst Grove, Peckham Rye.—A receiving order having been made against this debtor, the first meeting of creditors was held on Thursday last week, before Mr. E. L. Hough, Official Receiver. No statement of affairs was filed, but the liabilities were estimated at about £600. It appeared that the debtor commenced business as a builder in 1886 with £2,100 borrowed from his wife and her sister. In 1890 he began to erect five houses in Friern Road, East Dulwich, but owing to want of capital he could not continue. He was therefore financed by a Mr. Hayward, the petitioning creditor.\nDAKSHAR, M. J., builder, Oakhurst Grove, Peckham Rye.—The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Thursday last week before Mr. E. L. Hough, Official Receiver. No statement of affairs was filed, but the liabilities were estimated at about £600. It appeared that the debtor commenced business as a builder in 1886 with £2,100 borrowed from his wife and her sister.
