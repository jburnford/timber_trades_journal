W., builder, Leytonstone.—This case has been already reported, and the sitting for public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard, when the bankrupt attributed his failure to loss on contracts through the increase in price of building materials and wages. He returned his liabilities at £1,091 9s. 9d., and debts due to him £269 12s. 7d., with assets which realised £60 12s. 5d., including an estimated surplus of £213 7s. 5d. from fully secured creditors. The examination was closed.\nBUCKLE, J. C., builder, North Kensing ton and Shepherd's Bush.—The debtor filed a petition for liquidation in August, 1880, and he applied on Wednesday to Mr. Registrar Giffard for an order of discharge. The accounts showed unsecured debts £4,756 7s. 11d., and debts fully secured £6,825, against assets £1,765 17s. 3d. The estate should be liquidated by arrangement, and two trustees were appointed. The present application was made under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, 1869 (Discharge and Closure) Act, and no opposition being offered by creditors, the discharge was granted.\nCUMMINS, M. J., builder, 5, Oakhurst Grove, Peckham Rye.—A receiving order having been made against this debtor, the first meeting of creditors was held on Thursday last week, before Mr. E. L. Hough, Official Receiver. No statement of affairs was filed, but the liabilities were estimated at about £950. It appeared that the debtor commenced business as a builder in 1886 with £2,100, borrowed from his wife and her sister. In 1890 he began to build at East Dulwich, but owing to want of capital he could not continue. He was thereupon financed by a Mr. Hayward, the petition-\n\n877\nREGISTERED\n[Image of a swan in a circle with M.K]\nTRADE MARK.\nAND FOR\nSleepers\nBridges\nPiles\nStair Treads\nPlatforms\nChair Keys\nGate Heels\nPosts\nTelegraph Arms\nPoles\nand\nGeneral\nEngineering\nPurposes.\ning creditor. The debtor further stated that he had done no business during the last four years, and attributed his failure to loss incurred in building speculations prior to 1895. It was suggested that the meeting should be adjourned with a view to the appointment of a trustee. The Official Receiver refused the adjournment, he being of the opinion that no good would result from it. The matter would therefore remain in his hands for administration in bankruptcy. The public examination was appointed for June 14th.\nJONES, THOMAS PRICE, builder and contractor, Mount Pleasant, Abercynon.— The Official Receiver has issued a statement in this case under date 26th May, according to which the stock-in-trade estimated by debtor to produce £29 10s., fetched £27 5s. After paying costs of execution, and other costs and charges, the net realisations amount to £20 17s. 3d. The two heaviest unsecured creditors are timber trade creditors.\nNEWMAN, CHARLES, Monthermer Road Cardiff, and JAMES, JOHN WM., Colum Road Cardiff, trading as builders and contractors, Gwynnyth Street, Cathays.—A meeting of creditors was held at the Official Receiver's office, Cardiff, on Tuesday. The gross liabilities amounted to £7,710 12s. 5d., of which £987 13s. 7d., was expected to rank for dividend. The assets were estimated to produce £967 1s. 4d., leaving a deficiency of £20 12s. 3d. The debtors expressed the opinion that they were solvent if they could realise their properties. The receiving order was made upon the petition of the debtors, in consequence of their failure to carry out a private arrangement with their creditors. Newman was a plasterer by trade, and James for some years was in a solicitor's office. They commenced business as speculative builders four years ago without capital, and had built numerous houses upon speculation in the Whitchurch, Crwys, and Colum Roads, being financed as the work proceeded. Mrs. James and Mrs. Newman claimed to have an interest in four houses each, and they also claimed the household furniture.—Mr. Lewis Morgan appeared for the debtors.—No resolution was passed, and the Official Receiver remains trustee.\nPELL, W. J., builder, Queen's Road, Upper Norwood.—The debtor filed his own petition, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday, before Mr. C. A. Pope, Assistant Receiver. The unsecured debts were returned in the statement of affairs at £635 19s. 5d., and debts fully secured £1,117 18s. 11d., against assets £94 11s. 1d. Creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBaggs, C.

When he started he was in debt to the extent of £200. He had only completed four houses when the time for completion expired, and the freeholders took possession. He had since been in their employment at £2 10s. per week. All his debts were contracted in the erection of the five houses in Friern Dulwich, but owing to want of capital he could not continue. He was therefore financed by a Mr. Hayward, the petition-\nREGISTERED\n[Image of a swan in a circle with M.J]\nTRADE MARK\nRECORD OUTPUT OF TIMBER.\nCable advice from the Company's Mills gives the Output of Karri and Jarrah for the Twelve Months ended Dec. 31st, 1898, as\n66,724 LOADS, or 40,340,400 FEET SUPER.\nFull Particulars and Prices on Application to\nMILLARS' KARRI & JARRAH FORESTS, LIMITED,\n72, BISHOPSGATE STREET, LONDON, E.C.\nTelegrams: \"Jarrah, London.\"\nTelephone: 290 London Wall.",
