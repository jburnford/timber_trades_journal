The most important\nof these arrivals is the cargo per s.s.\n\"Moscow,\" being the first of this season's\nshipments from St. Petersburg. It is\ndivided among several receivers, and con-\ntains a good representation of Gromoff's\nwell known production in red and white-\nwood.\nA quiet tone still prevails, and no one\nseems to know when a settlement of the\njoiners' strike is likely to be arrived at;\na considerable number of the men have left\nthe district, and are said to be accepting\nemployment at lower wages elsewhere, but\non the other hand, a number of the local\nemployers have given in to the men's\ndemands. The remaining disputants seem\nequally determined not to come to terms.\n\n481\nIMPORTS.\nALLOA.\nMay 23 Waagen—Moss—226 lds. pitprops—Kirk-\nwood & Co.\nSirius—Gothenburg—264 lds. pitprops—Maden\n& Borch.\nJacob & Catharina—Riga—522 lds. pitprops—M.\nS.

A statement of income\nand expenditure is now laid before you, and\nas the information therein will doubtless be\nconsidered satisfactory, I think it will be un-\nnecessary for me to go more fully into the\ndetails of the year's working. The business\nduring the past year has again been very good,\nand the directors feel pleased that the result\nhave proved so satisfactory. The prospects\nfor the current year are also encouraging. I\nnow beg to move the adoption of the report\nas laid before you, and I will ask Mr. Reid\nto second it. The resolution is as follows:—\n\"That the statement of income and expendi-\nture and balance sheet, and the report of the\ndirectors and auditors thereon, for the year\nended 31st March, 1899, be, and the same are\nhereby received, approved, and adopted;\nthat the interim dividend at rate of 5 per cent.\nless income tax paid on preference shares to\nthe 30th September, 1898, be, and the same\nis hereby confirmed, and that a final dividend\nat same rate, less income tax for the six\nmonths ending 31st March, 1899, on said\nshares be now sanctioned and declared;\nfurther, that a dividend of thirty shillings per\nshare, equal to 15 per cent. free of income\ntax, be now sanctioned and declared on the\nordinary shares from the profits of that year.\"\nMr. Reid seconded this resolution, which\nwas unanimously carried. Mr. Reid then\nmoved that James Forrest and John Forrest\nbe re-elected directors of the company, which\nmotion was seconded by Mr. Kiep and\nunanimously carried.\nThe auditors, Moores, Carson and Watson,\nC. A. Glasgow, were re-appointed auditors\nfor the company for the current year.\nMr. Kiep then moved a vote of thanks to\nthe Chairman, and the proceedings then\nterminated.",
