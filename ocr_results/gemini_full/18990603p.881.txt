Trade prospects still continue bright, any-
thing but dull. Chamber Brothers, yacht builders, &c.,
have at present orders for fifty of their
patent collapsible lifeboats, all of which will
be built of teakwood diagonal.
Orders for a complete installation of
malting machinery and six sets of high
speed engines have been placed with J. &
R. Houston, engineers.
The Master Wrights' Association have
received notice from the Amalgamated
Society of Carpenters and Joiners of the
withdrawal of their demand for an advance
of one penny per hour. On the other hand
the masters have conceded weekly pay,
beginning Saturday, 3rd prox. Thus has a
threatened strike been averted, and a
friendly feeling been established for another
year at least.
The demand for house accommodation in
Port Glasgow appears to be as great as
ever, and local proprietors and builders are
pushing on with large blocks of tenements
in order to cope with the demand.
Appended are reproduced sale note of
auction conducted by McDowall & Neilson
at the Esplanade on Thursday, 1st inst.
The company was largely represented.

There is a long list of arrivals this week,
consisting of 26,132 deals and battens per
s.s. "Moscow," from St. Petersburg; 82
fathoms of firewood per "Albatross," from
Risoer; 55,200 oak staves per s.s. "Scotia,"
from Memel; 32 fathoms firewood per
"Gertrude," from Tvedestrand; 10 wain-
scot oak logs per s.s. "Orient," from
Libau; 5,814 deals per s.s. "Tronda,"
from Drontheim; 104 fathoms firewood per
"Alkor," from Arendal; 397 bundles and
277 pieces poplar lumber, 608 pieces oak
lumber, 32 logs hickory, and 192 deals
per s.s. "Prodano," from Baltimore; 25,-
192 deals and battens per s.s. "Annis-
more," from Riga. The most important
of these arrivals is the cargo per s.s.
"Moscow," being the first of this season's
shipments from St. Petersburg. It is
divided among several receivers, and con-
tains a good representation of Gromoff's
well known production in red and white-
wood.
A quiet tone still prevails, and no one
seems to know when a settlement of the
joiners' strike is likely to be arrived at;
a considerable number of the men have left
the district, and are said to be accepting
employment at lower wages elsewhere, but
on the other hand, a number of the local
employers have given in to the men's
demands. The remaining disputants seem
equally determined not to come to terms.

BROWNLEE & CO., LIMITED.
The third annual ordinary general meeting
of the shareholders of Brownlee and Company,
Limited, was held on Thursday last, 1st June.
The managing director, Mr. William Forrest,
chairman of the company, presiding.
The Secretary having read the notice calling
the meeting, the Chairman afterwards said:
As copies of the directors' report and
balance sheet have been sent to all the
shareholders, I presume you will hold same
as having been read. A statement of income
and expenditure is now laid before you, and
as the information therein will doubtless be
considered satisfactory, I think it will be un-
necessary for me to go more fully into the
details of the year's working. The business
during the past year has again been very good,
and the directors feel pleased that the result
have proved so satisfactory. The prospects
for the current year are also encouraging. I
now beg to move the adoption of the report
as laid before you, and I will ask Mr. Reid
to second it. The resolution is as follows:—
"That the statement of income and expendi-
ture and balance sheet, and the report of the
directors and auditors thereon, for the year
ended 31st March, 1899, be, and the same are
hereby received, approved, and adopted;
that the interim dividend at rate of 5 per cent.
less income tax paid on preference shares to
the 30th September, 1898, be, and the same
is hereby confirmed, and that a final dividend
at same rate, less income tax for the six
months ending 31st March, 1899, on said
shares be now sanctioned and declared;
further, that a dividend of thirty shillings per
share, equal to 15 per cent. free of income
tax, be now sanctioned and declared on the
ordinary shares from the profits of that year."
Mr. Reid seconded this resolution, which
was unanimously carried. Mr. Reid then
moved that James Forrest and John Forrest
be re-elected directors of the company, which
motion was seconded by Mr. Kiep and
unanimously carried.
The auditors, Moores, Carson and Watson,
C. A. Glasgow, were re-appointed auditors
for the company for the current year.
Mr. Kiep then moved a vote of thanks to
the Chairman, and the proceedings then
terminated.
