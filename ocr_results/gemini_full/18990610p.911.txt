Mr. J. C. Ireland was the trustee; Mr. Alexander

M’Culloch and William M’Kinley appeared for
creditors.—Bankrupt stated that he started
business in 1891, and carried it on successfully
for a few years. He thought his son John was
his partner, but there was no deed of co-partnery
signed by them. He began business with a
capital of between £70 and £80 which were his
own earnings. He had no liabilities at that
time. Bankrupt had not prepared nor lodged a
statement of his affairs, and the examination
was accordingly adjourned.
