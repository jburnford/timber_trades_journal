The gross liabilities were returned at £2,765 14s 8d., of which £1,721 is expected to rank for dividend. The assets are estimated to produce £1,215 15s. 10½d., after deducting £45 15s. 10½d. for preferential claims, thus leaving a deficiency of £505 4s. 1½d.—Mr E. Bicker, Trustee, was present, and Mr Tattersall solicitor, Bournemouth, appeared for the debtor.—Debtor stated that he commenced business in 1893 with a capital of £100, with which he paid £110 for a piece of land. It was to the Technical Institute contract that he attributed his failure. The contract was for £1,178, and the extras £1,757 10s., making a total of £2,935 10s. The original contract was afterwards increased to £1,900, on account of additions to the building. He estimated he would have lost £1,000 if he had completed the contract. The examination was adjourned until July 12th for debtor to prepare and file a deficiency account.\n\nMINDLE, ROBERT EDWARD, builder, of Ilford.—This debtor came up for his public examination on Wednesday last at the Chelmsford Bankruptcy Court. He had filed a statement of affairs which disclosed liabilities amounting to £729 9s. 3d., and no assets. He began business at Ilford about two years ago without capital, and he had built several houses, on which he says he lost money. He had taken about £2 10s. a week for living expenses. He had preferred certain creditors, but the only reason was because they were pressing him for their money. He had no idea he was doing wrong. He had also obtained building materials, although he knew he was insolvent. The furniture was claimed by his wife, and his house was mortgaged to the full value, and his wife had paid the rent on one occasion to prevent the furniture being seized. The examination was adjourned.\n\nHUGGINS, WM, timber merchant, of 4, Dunloe Street and 4, Oakfield Road, Hackney.—The receiving order in this case was made on the 2nd inst., upon the petition of Mr. Wm. Pharaoh, timber merchant, of 18, Bishopsgate Street Within, and the first meeting of creditors was held last Tuesday at the London Bankruptcy Court, before Mr H. L. Howell, Assistant Official Receiver. The debtor states that he commenced business as a timber merchant about 10 years ago, with practically no capital, at Hows Street, Kingsland Road. He remained at that address for twelve months, when he removed to premises opposite, where he traded for two years. After removing to 31, Dunloe Street, he about two years ago he commenced a fresh section of his business, putting down saw-mill plant, and he has since continued to trade in that way. A meeting of his creditors was held on May 1st last, when he offered to assign his estate to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors, provided that he was allowed to repay them at 5s in the £. The offer was not accepted, and a resolution was passed that he should file his petition, but before he could do so the petition on which the receiving order was made was presented. He attributed his insolvency to the result of departing from his original business to take up the saw-mill business, on timber purchased, and to bad debts. He has filed accounts showing unsecured liabilities £2,226 4s 11d., of which £2,191 1s. 11d. are unsecured, and assets £528 1s. 4d., leaving a deficiency of £1,698 3s. 7d.—The Official Receiver said it appeared from the deficiency account, which began with a surplus of liabilities over assets of £500 twelve months ago, that the chief losses were as follows:—Loss on trading, £300; household and personal expenses, £156; and estimated loss on the forced sale of machinery, &c., £600. An adjudication was submitted, and the debtor had consented to it. A resolution was passed appointing Mr. Wm. Izard, 52, Gracechurch Street, E.C., trustee of the estate, with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Pharaoh, Max Hahn, and Mr. W. M. Thompson. The trustee's bond was fixed at £250, and the public examination of the debtor was appointed for July 13th, at 11 o'clock.\nThe following are the principal creditors:—\nBlaauw, W., Bond Street, Vauxhall ... £135\nBrowning & Co., Abehurch Yard ... 187\nCollett & Sons, Seawfell Street ... 24\nDrummond & Co., Triangle, Hackney ... 15\nGimson & Co., Gt.
