There was not much complain of as regards prices ; fairly good being got for what was sold, but the demand was restricted, and the quantity of goods disposed of somewhat disappointing. The check to trade, caused by the unfortunate dispute between the master joiners and their men, is being more keenly felt the longer it is continued, and threatens to spoil what might have been a prosperous season.\n\nGREENOCK.\nThere have been no arrivals of wood cargoes this week.\nMcDowall & Neilsen will hold an auction sale here on Thursday, 29th inst.\nThe steamers \"Janeta\" and \"Osmansli\" are both on their way to Quebec to load timber cargoes for Greenock. The steamer \"Ulviken,\" on the other hand, will load 3,000 tons coal at Greenock for Cronstadt.\nThe wages paid labourers discharging timber-laden vessels at James Watt Dock is 8d. per hour, with 1s. per hour overtime, and difficulty is experienced in getting men.\nThe carters in town have made a demand for an increase of 1s. per week. Increased cartage rates will doubtless result.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nJune 13 Newharles-Rafso-1,782 deals, and boards-J. Fleming & Co, Ltd.\nJaederen-Skien-16 lds. hewn fir-J.
