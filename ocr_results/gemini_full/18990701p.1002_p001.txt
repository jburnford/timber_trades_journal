GREENOCK.
There are but two arrivals to note this week, viz. :—
The “Gunhilde” (1,183), from Chatham, N.B., is discharging at James Watt Dock 43,229 pieces spruce deals in good order; the “Mira” (s), 2086, from Pensacola, with 3,852 pieces sawn pitch pine timber, 9,232 pieces deals, and 220 loads boards, for McDowall & Neilson, and 220 tons of teak consigned to them. The steamer “Cameo” has been berthed in Albert Harbour to load 250 tons of teak logs for the Naval Constructional Implements Company, Barrow.
McDowall & Neilson's public sale took place to-day (Thursday) at the Esplanade, under fair weather conditions, and in the presence of a large company. The catalogue submitted contained the usual variety of timber and deals, including several items of the season's fresh importations. A fair amount of business was done, as will be seen from sale note appended.
The holiday season is now upon us here, and most public works will stop for eight or ten days, beginning 5th July.
