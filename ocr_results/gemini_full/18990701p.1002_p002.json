FULLARTON,\nWOOD MEASURERS AND FORWARDING AGENTS,\nYORKHILL WHARF, GLASGOW.\n\n1003\nAN ARBITRATION ORDERED.\nLord Stormonth Darling on Thursday last\nheard proof in an action by John H.\nDouglas & Co., timber merchants, 39, Mild-\nmay Chambers, Bishopsgate Street, London,\nagainst James Stiven, timber merchant, 7,\nRoyal Exchange Lane, Dundee. The pur-\nsuers sue for £85 19s 7d and for £250. They\nstated that in November, 1896, they sold\ntimber and squares to the defender, to be\nshipped at Tayport on board the s.s.\n“Caerloch” on 30th July, 1897 ; that the goods\nwere not in the possession of the pursuer, who\nused the goods charged, as well as a quantity of poles\nnot in the contract ; and that the pursuer took\npossession of the whole, and had cut up and\nused a greater part in his business. The price\nof the wood sold under the contract was £590\n19s. 2d., to account of which the defender has\npaid £420, leaving the first sum sued for due.\nThe second sum sued for is the\nprice of the poles, which were not under the\ncontract. The defender claims to be entitled\nto set off, as against the £73 7s. 5d. which he\nadmits to be due, sums due to him by the\npursuers in respect (1) of late shipment of the\ntimber ; and (2) the inferior quality of it, which\nsums would be not less, but more, than the\nsum sued for. He also claims to be entitled\nto deduct from the second sum sued for £190\n0s. 5d. as the freight due in respect of the\npoles. He further maintained that, in terms\nof a clause in a contract, the dispute should\nbe referred to Mr. John H. Douglas to deter-\nmine “in trade.”\nLord Stormonth Darling, having\nheard evidence as to the custom of the timber\ntrade, said he proposed to sist the action until\nthe matters in dispute should be determined\nby arbitration. It appeared to him that the\naverment of the defender was conclusively\nproved. That averment was that by the cus-\ntom of the timber trade, disputes, which are\nreferred to arbitration, are settled by two\narbiters—one chosen by each party and by an\noverman appointed by the creditors. The\ncase was accordingly sisted.\n\nFOR ALLEGED SERVICES RENDERED.\nAt the Edinburgh Court of Sessions on Wed-\nnesday, William Young, timber merchant, late\nof George Square, Glasgow, and now at Spring\nTalbot Road, Manchester, sued Hard-\nwood (Limited), timber merchants, 18, Ex-\nchange Street, Manchester, for payment of\n£1,100. The defending company was incor-\nporated on 27th May, 1898, and the pursuer\nwas, by the articles of association, appointed\none of the first directors of the company.\nShortly after the incorporation of the com-\npany, he says he was also appointed chairman\nand managing director, and the amount\nclaimed is his remuneration for services rendered\nbetween his appointment and 26th April, 1899,\nwhen he was told that his services were not\nrequired. The pursuer’s averments are denied\nby the defenders, who say that no demand\nwas ever made upon them for remuneration\nuntil this action was served. The record was\nclosed to-day, and the case sent to the Pro-\ncedure Roll. Counsel for the Pursuer—Mr.\nWatt and Mr. Williamson. Agents—Clark &\nMacdonald, S.S.C. Counsel for the Defenders\n—Mr. Graham Stewart. Agents—Davidson\n& Syme, W.S.\n\nJAMES JONES,\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\nLARBERT.\nEvery description of round and cut-up Home\nTimber supplied for Collieries, Cartwrights,\nCoachbuilders, Boatbuilders, Shipbuilders, &c.\n\nGREENHEART,\nMACLEAN, TODD, & CO.\nGREENOCK.\nTelegraphic Address,—“GREENHEART.”",
