AN ARBITRATION ORDERED.
Lord Stormonth Darling on Thursday last
heard proof in an action by John H.
Douglas & Co., timber merchants, 39, Mild-
may Chambers, Bishopsgate Street, London,
against James Stiven, timber merchant, 7,
Royal Exchange Lane, Dundee. The pur-
suers sue for £85 19s 7d and for £250. They
stated that in November, 1896, they sold
timber and squares to the defender, to be
shipped at Tayport on board the s.s.
“Caerloch” on 30th July, 1897 ; that the goods
were not in the possession of the pursuer, who
used the goods charged, as well as a quantity of poles
not in the contract ; and that the pursuer took
possession of the whole, and had cut up and
used a greater part in his business. The price
of the wood sold under the contract was £590
19s. 2d., to account of which the defender has
paid £420, leaving the first sum sued for due.
The second sum sued for is the
price of the poles, which were not under the
contract. The defender claims to be entitled
to set off, as against the £73 7s. 5d. which he
admits to be due, sums due to him by the
pursuers in respect (1) of late shipment of the
timber ; and (2) the inferior quality of it, which
sums would be not less, but more, than the
sum sued for. He also claims to be entitled
to deduct from the second sum sued for £190
0s. 5d. as the freight due in respect of the
poles. He further maintained that, in terms
of a clause in a contract, the dispute should
be referred to Mr. John H. Douglas to deter-
mine “in trade.”
Lord Stormonth Darling, having
heard evidence as to the custom of the timber
trade, said he proposed to sist the action until
the matters in dispute should be determined
by arbitration. It appeared to him that the
averment of the defender was conclusively
proved. That averment was that by the cus-
tom of the timber trade, disputes, which are
referred to arbitration, are settled by two
arbiters—one chosen by each party and by an
overman appointed by the creditors. The
case was accordingly sisted.

FOR ALLEGED SERVICES RENDERED.
At the Edinburgh Court of Sessions on Wed-
nesday, William Young, timber merchant, late
of George Square, Glasgow, and now at Spring
Talbot Road, Manchester, sued Hard-
wood (Limited), timber merchants, 18, Ex-
change Street, Manchester, for payment of
£1,100. The defending company was incor-
porated on 27th May, 1898, and the pursuer
was, by the articles of association, appointed
one of the first directors of the company.
Shortly after the incorporation of the com-
pany, he says he was also appointed chairman
and managing director, and the amount
claimed is his remuneration for services rendered
between his appointment and 26th April, 1899,
when he was told that his services were not
required. The pursuer’s averments are denied
by the defenders, who say that no demand
was ever made upon them for remuneration
until this action was served. The record was
closed to-day, and the case sent to the Pro-
cedure Roll. Counsel for the Pursuer—Mr.
Watt and Mr. Williamson. Agents—Clark &
Macdonald, S.S.C. Counsel for the Defenders
—Mr. Graham Stewart. Agents—Davidson
& Syme, W.S.
