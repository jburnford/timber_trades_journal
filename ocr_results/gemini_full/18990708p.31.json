W. Beattie on Tuesday, 4th inst., at the Edinburgh salerooms, there was only a moderate attendance of buyers, and although a fair business was done for the numbers present, no large quantities of any particular description were disposed of.\nThe catalogue included, besides balances of last season's shipments from Wyburg, cargoes of deals and battens from Sundswall and Riga, well manufactured goods, and better qualities prices were well maintained, and even a turn dearer.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nMackellar & Macphee, Timber Merchants and Saw-millers,\nTelegrams—\"Mackellar, Gallowgate, Glasgow.\" Telephone No. 987.\nCENTRAL SAW-MILLS, GALLOWGATE, Glasgow.\nMahogany, Birch, Walnut, Ash, &c.

McCrae, Glasgow.\nThe shipbuilding and kindred trades in Greenock and Port Glasgow continue active, and the same remark applies to housebuilding in both centres.\nThe feature of the week in the timber trade is unquestionably the stock sheet for the quarter ending June 30th, and we now reproduce same, which obviates the necessity for percentages or comment.\n\nStatement of stock of sawn and hewn timber at Greenock and Port Glasgow for quarter ending June 30th, 1899.\nIn importers' hands.

The jury expressed the opinion that the deceased met his death through improper timbering. A juryman remarked that there was culpable negligence.—The Coroner: Then I must commit somebody for trial.—Mr. Matthews, Her Majesty's inspector of mines, said he knew of collieries where systematic timbering had been adopted with success, and the sooner the Legislature made it compulsory the better.—The Coroner said, with his fifteen years' experience of colliery inquiries he had come to the conclusion. They ought not to allow the responsibility of timbering to remain with the collier; and if the colliery proprietors would not voluntarily do what they ought to do to protect life, then the Legislature must step in and make them.—The jury ultimately agreed that death was accidental, and recommended systematic timbering.\n\nA new firm, to be styled Campbell & Downes, Limited, has been formed to take over the old-established saw-mill business of P. & A. Campbell, Windsor Saw-mills, Govan, and the timber and import business of Peter B. Downes & Co., Pollokshaws.\n\nCOMPANY PROMOTION IN SCOTLAND.—In the last quarter of 1897 the number of registrations of public companies in Scotland reached the record figure of 112. During the quarter just ended, the total has reached 116, the highest mark of registration north of the Tweed. Amongst these were included three timber and saw-milling companies with a capital of £166,000, J.
