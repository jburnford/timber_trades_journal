LEITH.
As regards arrivals this week we are not so numerous, there being no parcels of pine and poplar wood by the steamer from Baltimore, but a cargo of deals and battens by steamer from St. Petersburg, a cargo of fir-deals from Fredrikstad, and two smaller cargoes of deals and battens, one from Nystad and the other from Wyburg.
There is an improved feeling in the trade, and but for the resumption of work through the settlement of the joiners strike, but little actual business done has been somewhat interfered with by the holiday character of the week in connection with the Prince of Wales's visit to Edinburgh and the Highland Agricultural Show.
The public sale held by D. W. Beattie on Tuesday, 4th inst., at the Edinburgh salerooms, there was only a moderate attendance of buyers, and although a fair business was done for the numbers present, no large quantities of any particular description were disposed of.
The catalogue included, besides balances of last season's shipments from Wyburg, cargoes of deals and battens from Sundswall and Riga, well manufactured goods, and better qualities prices were well maintained, and even a turn dearer.

GREENOCK.
The Fair holidays in Greenock and Port Glasgow commenced on Wednesday last, and in most cases will extend to the end of next week; so that comparatively little business of importance will be transacted until the public works are again re-open.
There is one arrival for the week, namely, the "Acmes" (1,888), with 3,154 pieces sawn pitch pine timber and 1,895 pieces deals, from Ship Island, for John W. McCrae, Glasgow.
The shipbuilding and kindred trades in Greenock and Port Glasgow continue active, and the same remark applies to housebuilding in both centres.
The feature of the week in the timber trade is unquestionably the stock sheet for the quarter ending June 30th, and we now reproduce same, which obviates the necessity for percentages or comment.

THE TIMBERING OF MINES.
Mr. Brighouse, county coroner, held an inquiry at Ince, Wigan, relative to the death of Joseph Almond, twenty-three years of age, a drawer, of Ince, who had been fatally injured in the Moss Colliery, belonging to Pearson & Knowles. The jury expressed the opinion that the deceased met his death through improper timbering. A juryman remarked that there was culpable negligence.—The Coroner: Then I must commit somebody for trial.—Mr. Matthews, Her Majesty's inspector of mines, said he knew of collieries where systematic timbering had been adopted with success, and the sooner the Legislature made it compulsory the better.—The Coroner said, with his fifteen years' experience of colliery inquiries he had come to the conclusion. They ought not to allow the responsibility of timbering to remain with the collier; and if the colliery proprietors would not voluntarily do what they ought to do to protect life, then the Legislature must step in and make them.—The jury ultimately agreed that death was accidental, and recommended systematic timbering.

A new firm, to be styled Campbell & Downes, Limited, has been formed to take over the old-established saw-mill business of P. & A. Campbell, Windsor Saw-mills, Govan, and the timber and import business of Peter B. Downes & Co., Pollokshaws.
