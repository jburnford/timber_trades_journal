Erik Jakob Osterberg of By, Esbjorn Gerdin, of Hernosand, and Berthel Sandstrom, of Ornskoldsvik are directors.\n\nSawing began on 4th inst. with 10 frames at Korsnäs new mill.\n\nOn 30th June, Kopparberg-Hofors Sågverks Aktiebolag held an ordinary meeting at Falun.\nLieut.-Colonel P. G. W. Hanngren was elected managing director in place of the deceased Ernst Nisser and Messrs. Martin Nisser, senr., and S. Månsson were elected directors.\nThe substitutes are Messrs. B. Bellander & Martin Nisser, jun.\n\nMr. O. Jonsson, of Hof, member of the committee for the care of the forests, at the recent forest meeting at Ljusdal, stated that the committee might be ready with their recommendations in 4 or 5 weeks.\nThey will contain legal provisions touching resowing, felling, &c., and plans aiming at protection against forest devastation.\nMeanwhile Mr. Jonsson for his part expected more from private initiative than from legislation, although this was not to be despised for calling to life a more rational forest domestic economy.\n\nAt a company meeting in Stockholm, Ornskoldsviks Angsågs Aktiebolag re-elected the directors and revisers.\n\nThe directors of Stromnäs Aktiebolag were re-elected at a meeting held on 3rd inst.\n\nA Norrland paper's market report says that for autumn shipment to Germany 7in. white battens fetch 125 marks, and 6 inch 120 marks.\nFrench buyers are also in the market with offers for the autumn.\nThe quotations show an increase of 5 to 10 fcs. over the spring prices.\nFor 3x9 red 5ths, 165 fcs. is offered, and for white deals 180 fcs. 1x4 & 4 1/2in. red p'anchettes fetch 155 and 145 fcs., while in same sizes 120 and 115 fcs., an increase for white of over 10 fcs. on the earlier obtained prices.\nAs the stock of planchettes is by no means so great as one imagined, a further rise in price for this article may be expected.\nThe prices for white floorings to Holland have been, for 9 inch 94 to 96 florins, 8 inch 88 florins, 7 inch 84 florins, and 6 inch 81 florins for known marks.\nFrom Spain also enquiries arrive for goods for later shipment.\n\nThe new Ekman Joinery Co., of Stockholm, have recently shipped to Liverpool some very elaborate woodwork for use in the erection of stables and a lodge to be erected near Southport, from the plans of an eminent English architect.\nWe understand that the whole of this important contract was executed in one week, and within 24 hours of the stipulated limit of time.\n\nFINLAND.\nThe flood in the Kymmene valley (Finland) has been increased in consequence of the rain during the midsummer holidays.\nHirvikoski, in the same parish is almost entirely cut off from the outside world.\n\nOn 7th inst., it was reported from St. Michel that the water in Saimen, which had hitherto risen uninterruptedly, had fallen 2 inches during 24 hours previously.\nLikewise the water in Puulavesi has fallen.\n\nA large forest fire broke out on 3rd inst. in the vicinity of Lojo (Finland), when some tunnland of forest were calculated to have been destroyed.\n\nKNOTT & BARKER, GRIMSBY\n\nJULY 15, 1899\nSCOTCH SECTION.\nSINGLETON, DUNN & CO.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n27, UNION STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\n\"SINGLETONS, GLASGOW.\"\n\nEDMISTON & MITCHELLS,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n33, RENFIELD STREET, GLASGOW.\n\nTHOMSON & GRAY,\nTEAK IMPORTERS,\n44, WEST GEORGE STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"TEAK, GLASGOW.\"\n\nA. & G.
