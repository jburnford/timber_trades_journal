SWEDEN.
Sprängsvikens Aktiebolag, at an ordinary meeting, recently re-elected the directors and revisers.

Svano Angsågs Aktiebolag and Bergholms Angsågs Aktiebolag have just recently held their ordinary meetings.

On 9th November, the prospectus was adopted of Strängo Trävaru Aktiebolag, which after purchasing Strängo saw mill was to carry on timber business.
The directorate is at Ornskoldsvik, and the share capital amounts to 256,000 kr.
Messrs. Erik Jakob Osterberg of By, Esbjorn Gerdin, of Hernosand, and Berthel Sandstrom, of Ornskoldsvik are directors.

Sawing began on 4th inst. with 10 frames at Korsnäs new mill.

On 30th June, Kopparberg-Hofors Sågverks Aktiebolag held an ordinary meeting at Falun.
Lieut.-Colonel P. G. W. Hanngren was elected managing director in place of the deceased Ernst Nisser and Messrs. Martin Nisser, senr., and S. Månsson were elected directors.
The substitutes are Messrs. B. Bellander & Martin Nisser, jun.

Mr. O. Jonsson, of Hof, member of the committee for the care of the forests, at the recent forest meeting at Ljusdal, stated that the committee might be ready with their recommendations in 4 or 5 weeks.
They will contain legal provisions touching resowing, felling, &c., and plans aiming at protection against forest devastation.
Meanwhile Mr. Jonsson for his part expected more from private initiative than from legislation, although this was not to be despised for calling to life a more rational forest domestic economy.

At a company meeting in Stockholm, Ornskoldsviks Angsågs Aktiebolag re-elected the directors and revisers.

The directors of Stromnäs Aktiebolag were re-elected at a meeting held on 3rd inst.

A Norrland paper's market report says that for autumn shipment to Germany 7in. white battens fetch 125 marks, and 6 inch 120 marks.
French buyers are also in the market with offers for the autumn.
The quotations show an increase of 5 to 10 fcs. over the spring prices.
For 3x9 red 5ths, 165 fcs. is offered, and for white deals 180 fcs. 1x4 & 4 1/2in. red p'anchettes fetch 155 and 145 fcs., while in same sizes 120 and 115 fcs., an increase for white of over 10 fcs. on the earlier obtained prices.
As the stock of planchettes is by no means so great as one imagined, a further rise in price for this article may be expected.
The prices for white floorings to Holland have been, for 9 inch 94 to 96 florins, 8 inch 88 florins, 7 inch 84 florins, and 6 inch 81 florins for known marks.
From Spain also enquiries arrive for goods for later shipment.

The new Ekman Joinery Co., of Stockholm, have recently shipped to Liverpool some very elaborate woodwork for use in the erection of stables and a lodge to be erected near Southport, from the plans of an eminent English architect.
We understand that the whole of this important contract was executed in one week, and within 24 hours of the stipulated limit of time.

FINLAND.
The flood in the Kymmene valley (Finland) has been increased in consequence of the rain during the midsummer holidays.
Hirvikoski, in the same parish is almost entirely cut off from the outside world.

On 7th inst., it was reported from St. Michel that the water in Saimen, which had hitherto risen uninterruptedly, had fallen 2 inches during 24 hours previously.
Likewise the water in Puulavesi has fallen.

A large forest fire broke out on 3rd inst. in the vicinity of Lojo (Finland), when some tunnland of forest were calculated to have been destroyed.

TRADE REPORTS.

GLASGOW.
The annual Fair holidays commence this week, and work in the shipbuilding yards, saw-mills, and public works will be suspended in Glasgow and neighbourhood for about ten days.

During the holidays little or no business can be transacted, and there is nothing of interest to note excepting the import.
The arrivals this week consist of a full cargo of deals per "Tiverton" (ss), from Quebec, which are in course of delivery from ship's side to Brownlee & Co., Ltd., and a cargo of deals is to hand at Bowling per "Salacia" from Tadousac, for the Singer Manufacturing Company.
By the regular liners from Quebec and Montreal, 200 standards of deals are landed at Princes Dock per "Salacia" (ss), consigned to Calder, Henderson & Livingston, and the "Buenos Ayrean" has discharged at Yarkhill Wharf the same quantity for Brownlee & Co., Edmiston & Mitchells.

From Newport News the "Keemun" has just arrived with a considerable variety of hardwoods, including walnut, ash, hickory, chestnut, and whitewood logs, and various parcels of lumber, details of which will be given when next writing.

Deliveries have been well maintained till the holidays began, but will be restricted till well on in next week.
The import continues fair, and this week amounts to 8,600 loads from Glasgow, 3,100 loads from Greenock, and 8,000 from Grangemouth.

GREENOCK.
A cargo of 37,668 pieces deals and ends for Blackwood & Co., Port Glasgow, has just arrived to-day (Thursday) per the Norwegian barque "Macduff" (1,212), from M'ramichi.
The vessel will discharge at the James Watt Dock.

Holidays finish here on Saturday.
Business will resume on Monday, 17th inst.

LEITH.
The arrivals continue on a moderate scale, comprising merely one steamer cargo of deals and battens, and one sailer cargo of similar goods from Rafso; a cargo of boards from Hudikswall, and a cargo of battens from Hernosand, along with some parcels of lathwood, rickers and deals by steamer from Riga.

The influence of the resumption of work by the joiners is now making itself felt in the demand for wood, and this, coupled with the advancing tendency of prices at the shipping ports should enable merchants here to establish some improvement in current rates.
There is certainly no occasion for the extreme cutting of rates which has prevailed for some time, and there are not wanting signs that this is being realised, which is the first step in the right direction.
