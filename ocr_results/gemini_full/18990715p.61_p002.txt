OBITUARY.
DEATH OF A GREENOCK BUILDER.
MR. JOHN KIRK, of the firm of J. and A. Kirk, builders and contractors, Greenock, died at his residence, 47, Brisbane Street, on Wednesday evening, 12th inst., shortly after 7 o'clock. Seven weeks ago, Mr. Kirk, while walking along a street in Glasgow, apparently in his usual good health, was suddenly stricken down by a paralytic shock and removed to the Royal Infirmary. After lying there for some weeks, he recovered sufficiently to admit of being removed to his home in Greenock.
The slight improvement which followed gave rise to the hope that he might pull through, but despite the best medical skill and care, it was evident for some days past that the end was near and he passed quietly away at the time stated.
Deceased was a native of Greenock—a member of the old Parochial Board, a singer of no mean repute, and a director of the Mechanics' Institute for many years. He was also a member of the Ardgowan Bowling Club and president of the Greenock Curling Club. In his death St. John Masonic Lodge and Greenock Burn's Club have lost an esteemed member. He was one of the oldest members of Nelson Street E. U. Church. Mr. Kirk was of a kindly disposition and much esteemed. Deceased, who was in the fifty-second year of his age, leaves a widow and two of a family to mourn his loss.

FIRES.—A fire occurred last week on the premises of Mr. McDonald, cabinet maker, Melrose. Much valuable furniture in the course of construction and repair was destroyed.

SALE BY AUCTION.—As announced in our advertising columns, Mr. Dowell will sell by auction the timber, fittings, &c., of the Highland and Agricultural Society's show at Edinburgh on Wednesday and Thursday next. The sale will commence at 11 a.m. on each day.

The business of Jas Kennedy & Co., timber merchants, 69, Buchanan Street, Glasgow, which has lately been a limited company, will be conducted as a private concern, with Mr. Kennedy as governing director, Messrs. Benson, Donald & Ferris as directors, and Mr. M'Innes as secretary. Mr. Donald, Mr. Ferris and Mr. M'Innes in Glasgow, Mr. Menzies in Liverpool, and Mr. Benson and Mr. O'rock in America will continue in charge of their respective departments.

TIMBER CARGO CONSIGNEES SUED FOR DEMURRAGE.
This was an action in which demurrage was claimed for alleged delay in the discharge of the ship "Familjen," at Greenock. Mr. Delmar, the owner of the vessel, was pursuer, and the defenders were M. Dowall and Neilson, Glasgow. Sheriff-Substitute Guthrie, before whom the action was heard in Glasgow, found that it had not been proved that the vessel was detained beyond the customary time for discharging through any fault of the defenders, who were consignees of the greater part of the cargo, and that last discharge. He therefore held that the defenders were not liable in demurrage and assoilzied them, and found them entitled to expenses. His lordship remarked that the evidence left no doubt that much of the delay was due to the rigid and unaccommodating spirit of the pursuer or his stevedores, and or their failure to see that it was their reasonable duty if they desired a quick despatch. Pursuer appealed against the decision, and Sheriff-Principal Berry has now issued an interlocutor in which he upholds the deliverance of the Sheriff-Substitute, and finds the appellant liable in the expenses of the appeal. In the course of a note he says: The clause in the charter on which this case depended was that in regard to discharge the cargo was "to be received from ship at port of discharge with customary despatch at such place, wharf, or dock as the charterers or their agents may direct on or after arrival." If, through any fault of the merchant or charterers, the vessel is longer detained, demurrage to be paid at 3d. per register ton per like (i.e., working) day. The vessel was a sailing ship of 1,510 tons. She carried 607 standards of deals. The discharge began on Saturday, 4th December, 1897, and was not finished till Tuesday, 11th January, 1898. That seemed to imply a slow rate of discharge, but still the liability for demurrage depended on fault on the part of the merchants in receiving delivery, and on careful consideration of the proof, he did not think that fault on their part had been established. According to the evidence, Mr. Hunter, measurer, who acted for the defenders (Messrs. Ross & Marshall) to put on two winches, i.e., at the after-hatch, which was the only one used. Mr. Hunter told them that it was impossible to use the reply he got was that it was impossible. The ship was water-logged, and the pumping operations which were going on during the discharge prevented the use of that hatch. That if more hatches had been used there would have been less delay could hardly be doubted, but the use of them was not given.
