The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £800 3s. 11d., and a debt fully secured £146, against assets £139 4s. 11d. The bankrupt states that in June, 1898, with £50 capital, he began business as a builder and contractor at the above address. He continued trading down to the date of the receiving order, and attributed his failure to losses on contracts and in general trading, in consequence of the increased price of material and labour, and also to insufficient capital. The debtor filed a deficiency account, but the Official Receiver reported that the figures were merely estimates and incapable of verification. Mr. E. S. Grey attended as Assistant Receiver. Mr. Colyer on behalf of the petitioning creditor. The examination was ordered to be concluded.\n\nCUMMINS, M. J., builder, 5, Oakhurst Grove, Peckham Rye.—An adjourned sitting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Linklater. The debtor stated that he carried on business as a speculative builder at East Dulwich from 1886 until Christmas, 1895, since which time he has been without regular occupation and chiefly dependent on his wife's earnings. He attributes his insolvency to losses incurred in his building operations and to law costs. The examination was closed, the statement of affairs, as amended, showing total liabilities £2,565 17s. 6d., of which £2,098 17s. 6d. are unsecured and assets, consisting of an estimated surplus of £200 from property held as security.\n\nDAWSON, SAMUEL, 240, Claremont Road, Middleton Street, Moss Side, near Manchester, late Wharf Saw Mill, Granby Row, Manchester, late timber merchant, &c. —According to the accounts herein the gross liabilities amount to £3,314 13s. 1d., of which £1,803 10s. 7d. is unsecured, and assets are expected to produce £53 17s. 5d., thus showing a deficiency of £1,111 17s. 2d.\n\nEDWARDS BROTHERS, builders, 22, Bond, Liverpool.—Herein the liabilities amount to £567 5s. 6d., thus showing a deficiency of £562 5s. 6d., and assets nil. The following are creditors:—Evans J. & Sons, Liverpool, £25; Kettle, Thos. and Co., Liverpool, £42; Roberts, David and Co., Liverpool, [?]\n\nHEDGES, JOHN (trading as John Hedges & Co.), timber merchant, Wilmer Gardens, Kingsland, N.E.—A sitting for public examination was held in this case on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Hope.

Creditors: Ben Tillett, Manchester, £127; Budgett Bros., Bristol, £207; Travers & Co., London, £100; Pharaoh, Gane & Co., £207. It appeared that in from 1872 he commenced business as a band sawyer (hiring the machinery and motive power), and in 1888 he took the same under the style of John Hedges & Co.\n\nROBINSON'S PATENTS, LTD.\nThis company has been registered with a capital of £5,000 in £1 shares, to acquire and carry on the business of a box and wood food cake maker, timber merchant, manufacturer, steam sawyer, joiner, merchant, &c., carried on at Clitheroe by J.
