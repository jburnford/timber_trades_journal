Good goods by steamers from Baltimore, Ontheim, Archangel, Riga, and Libau.
John Mitchell & Co. held their usual summer sale on Tuesday, 18th inst. at their Leith Walk Saw Mills.
The catalogue included a very large and varied assortment of both American and Baltic wood goods of the new season’s shipments.
There was, as usual with this firm’s sales, a large representative company, but unfavourable weather conditions somewhat interfered with the proceedings.
The tone of the sale was good, however, and a large quantity of waney board pine logs, and yellow pine deals, ards, and strips were disposed of at excellent prices.
Owing to the interruption of bad weather already referred to, there was not sufficient time to overtake all the Baltic goods, but fair lines of deals and battens, also of floorings and linings, were placed favourably with the rates, which compare favourably with those obtained at recent auctions.
Waney board pine fetched 2s. 9d to 3s 3d per cubic foot for large sized logs, whilst some of the smaller logs were sold at 2s 6d to 2s. 8d.
A parcel of fresh birch logs were disposed of at 1s. 8d. to 1s 11d per cubic foot.
First yellow pine deals, broad and long, brought 3s. 3½d, whilst 10 and 11ft brought 3s.
Broad deals and 14 to 16ft., 11 by 3, of similar quality, were sold at 2s. 10d. and similar ends of broad dimensions at 2s 7d.
Boards, 2in., 1¾in., 1½in.; and 1¼in., brought 1s. 5d. to 2s. 6d., whilst 4 to 6 by 3 strips fetched 2s. 5d. for 12 to 16ft. lengths.
