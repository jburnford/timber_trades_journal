FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
It should be understood that in cases where names are published, we do not hold ourselves responsible for their debts.

ASTLEY, JAMES, builder, of 1, Longford-street, Warrington, lately carrying on business at Longford, Warrington.
A meeting of the creditors concerned in this failure was held on the 20th inst., at the office of the Official Receiver, Manchester.
A statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed liabilities amounting to £402 19s. 10d., and there was an estimated surplus of assets over liabilities of £36. The debtor alleged his failure to be due to loss through building property not being let when complete. Eventually it was resolved that Mr. Edwin Bradshaw, chartered accountant, of Warrington, as trustee of the estate, in conjunction with a committee of inspection, should be appointed.

DUNN, ALEC. CHARLES, timber merchant, of Bramfield, Suffolk.
At the Shirehall, Ipswich, on the 21st inst., the public examination of this debtor was held.
The statement of affairs had already been published in volunteer unit[?].
The debtor said he served an apprenticeship at Yarmouth from 1886 to 1888, in London, and afterwards served. He had no means when he started. He had borrowed £200 on a reversion.
He bought a public-house, and subsequently exchanged it for a London business with a furnishing firm.
He went to Yarmouth as an insurance agent, and as there was a dispute about the business he went to America.
He returned to England and started business at Ipswich, and afterwards bought some willow trees on commission.
All his wife's expectancy had been lost, and he put it, not the money, into the business.
For three and a half years he had been insolvent, and he finally comme[nced].
