B., builder, Filliside, Osborne Road, Portwood, Hants.—The sitting for the public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Southampton Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Daw, and Mr. J. H. F. Wharton, deputy Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, and Mr. Ellaby.\nThe bankrupt stated that he commenced business at Middle Street, Bevois Town, about 1890, and removed to Cambridge Road, Bevois Hill, in 1894.\nHis capital at starting was £93 cash, and he had some property the equity of which he considered was worth £150.\nHe attributed his failure to losses on contracts, and property not letting.\nHe had lost on several contracts, but none of these had occurred during the last 18 months.\nHad made no investment of any money, and he had fully disclosed the whole of his estate.\nHe was still prepared to maintain that the stock and business at Cambridge Road belonged to his son to the extent of £100.\nMr. Wharton said he should then apply for an adjournment either to the judge or an examination of the son.\nThe Registrar said it was one of the grossest cases he had had before him.\nBankrupt further examined said he guaranteed some of the debts of his son, and that was really part of the cause of his insolvency.\nThe Registrar said he noticed that a considerable portion of the bankrupt's liabilities, which amounted to £1,271, was contracted during 1898 and 1899.\nHe noticed most of it was for timber, where was that delivered?\nBankrupt says at his buildings.\nThe Registrar said the case required considerable investigation at the hand of the Official Receiver, and the public examination would be adjourned until August 23rd.\n\nMORRIS, WILLIAM, 14, Greenfield Terrace, Penygraig, Glam., builder and contractor.—This debtor attended for his public examination at the July sittings of the Pontypridd Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Spickett.\nThe gross liabilities were returned at £2,139 19s. 9d., and debtor estimated a surplus of assets over liabilities of £284 3s. 9d.\nIn the course of a long examination, conducted by the Official Receiver (Mr. W. L. Daniel), debtor said he had carried on business without keeping proper books of account.\nHe had kept time books, but had neither kept a cash book, ledger with creditors, or ledger with debtors to the estate.\nThe Official Receiver: Well, now, tell the Court how was it possible for you to carry on a business of this kind, above all, for ten years without keeping any kind of book.—Debtor said he had been trying to make his accounts square as often as he could.—The Official Receiver: But, Mr. Morris, this is not your first trouble.—Debtor admitted he had three years ago effected a composition of 10s. in the £.\nHe was then in the same position as now as far as books were concerned.\nHe had given a",
