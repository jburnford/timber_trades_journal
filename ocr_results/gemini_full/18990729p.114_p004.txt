FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
It must be overlooked that in many cases the names are published in these columns for their debts, sometimes of a trifling amount.

JAMES, JAMES, builder, of 123, Orford Lane, Warrington, lately carrying on business at Longford, Warrington.
The first meeting of creditors concerned under this failure was held on the 20th inst., at the offices of the Official Receiver, Manchester.
The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £402 19s. 10d., and there was no surplus of assets over liabilities.
The debtor alleged his failure to have had enough building property on an improving estate.
Eventually it was decided to appoint Mr. Edwin Bradshaw, chartered accountant, Warrington, as trustee of the estate, to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection of three appointed creditors.

CHARLE, CHARLES, timber commission agent, of Bramfield, Suffolk, came up for his public examination at the Yarmouth Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday.
The statement of affairs had been filed showing gross liabilities £1,055 1s. 2d., of which £226 10s. 4d. is expected to rank for dividend, and assets £103 5s. 1d.
The bankrupt has not kept a cash account, and attributes his deficiency to losses on contracts and bad debts.
At the date of the receiving order several creditors had obtained judgment, and the bankrupt alleges that he was not aware of his insolvency until about six weeks before the receiving order.
He has not yet filed an account in explanation of his deficiency.
The following are creditors:—

MEREFIELD, FREDK. A. B., builder, Filliside, Osborne Road, Portwood, Hants.—The sitting for the public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Southampton Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Daw, and Mr. J. H. F. Wharton, deputy Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, and Mr. Ellaby.
The bankrupt stated that he commenced business at Middle Street, Bevois Town, about 1890, and removed to Cambridge Road, Bevois Hill, in 1894.
His capital at starting was £93 cash, and he had some property the equity of which he considered was worth £150.
He attributed his failure to losses on contracts, and property not letting.
He had lost on several contracts, but none of these had occurred during the last 18 months.
Had made no investment of any money, and he had fully disclosed the whole of his estate.
He was still prepared to maintain that the stock and business at Cambridge Road belonged to his son to the extent of £100.
Mr. Wharton said he should then apply for an adjournment either to the judge or an examination of the son.
The Registrar said it was one of the grossest cases he had had before him.
Bankrupt further examined said he guaranteed some of the debts of his son, and that was really part of the cause of his insolvency.
The Registrar said he noticed that a considerable portion of the bankrupt's liabilities, which amounted to £1,271, was contracted during 1898 and 1899.
He noticed most of it was for timber, where was that delivered?
Bankrupt says at his buildings.
The Registrar said the case required considerable investigation at the hand of the Official Receiver, and the public examination would be adjourned until August 23rd.

MORRIS, WILLIAM, 14, Greenfield Terrace, Penygraig, Glam., builder and contractor.—This debtor attended for his public examination at the July sittings of the Pontypridd Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Spickett.
The gross liabilities were returned at £2,139 19s. 9d., and debtor estimated a surplus of assets over liabilities of £284 3s. 9d.
In the course of a long examination, conducted by the Official Receiver (Mr. W. L. Daniel), debtor said he had carried on business without keeping proper books of account.
He had kept time books, but had neither kept a cash book, ledger with creditors, or ledger with debtors to the estate.
The Official Receiver: Well, now, tell the Court how was it possible for you to carry on a business of this kind, above all, for ten years without keeping any kind of book.—Debtor said he had been trying to make his accounts square as often as he could.—The Official Receiver: But, Mr. Morris, this is not your first trouble.—Debtor admitted he had three years ago effected a composition of 10s. in the £.
He was then in the same position as now as far as books were concerned.
He had given a
