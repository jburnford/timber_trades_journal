RECORD BAND-SAW.—It is always satisfactory to record any triumph of English-made goods gained at the expense of their foreign rivals. The latest success of this sort has been made by the "band-saws" of Messrs Eadon & Sons, of Sheffield and London. The "band-saw," which is a sort of combination of the circular saw and fret saw, is a French invention, and, until the above-mentioned English firm took it up, was the monopoly of a Paris firm called Perin. Recently Eadon & Sons hit upon a new process in the manufacture of this somewhat delicate article, and have consequently been receiving large orders from all parts of the world. A few days ago one of their wood-cutting saws was engaged in getting through a piece of timber from the keel of a vessel. When the operation was completed every one present was astonished to find that the saw had also gone clean through an iron bolt as thick as a man's wrist. Contact with a bolt won't be enough to shiver an ordinary band-saw."—"Evening News."

TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
The holidays here are now at an end, and business is gradually getting into its usual channels. There is, however, little to report in the way of sales of deals coming to hand in Glasgow, but several parcels were disposed of to buyers in the country during the holiday season. The import is still in fulfilment of contract. This week the s.s. "Matthara" is on the quay." This week the s.s. "Orcadian" from Quebec, has arrived with a full cargo of spruce, fully half of which is on contract. The consignees are Messrs. McDowall & Co., Stewart & Marshall, Robin & Co., and Buchanan & French. An important arrival of hardwoods is to hand per "Indrani," from Baltimore, and is discharging at Princes Dock, several lots of whitewood logs, oak planks and

boards, and varied parcels of whitewood boards, etc.
Deliveries from the "Orthia," which arrived during the holidays, are now going on briskly, and little of the wood landed seems likely to be stored. There is a good demand for all furniture woods, prime walnut and whitewood is in request, and mahogany has been completely out of stock for several months. A cargo directed here would meet a particularly favourable market.
The import to Glasgow this week amounts to 10,300 loads—to Greenock, 10,600 loads, and Grangemouth, 10,027 loads.
With the comparatively small quantity of deals coming to hand on consignment since the Quebec season commenced, and the quantities which have been disposed of by private sales, there has been little inducement till now to hold public sales. A public auction of deals, is now intimated to be held at Glasgow, on the 2nd August, by Calder, Henderson & Livingston.

GREENOCK.
The Norwegian ship "Bellevue" (1,420) arrived here this Thursday afternoon, and has been berthed at James Watt Dock to discharge cargo of sawn pitch timber, comprising 2,218 logs and 519 stowage deals, for Robinson, Dunn & Co., Glasgow.
The steamers "Janetta" and "Osmali," from Quebec, with cargoes of Canadian timber and deals, are now due, and are expected to arrive within a day or two. There are also at present some four or five cargoes on the way from pitch pine ports.
The building trade in town and suburbs continues busy.

LEITH.
The arrivals since last report include a cargo of timber and deals from Libau, two sailer cargoes of battens from Hernosand and Laurvig, a steamer cargo of deals and battens from Helsingfors, a cargo of oak staves by sailing vessel from Memel, and a shipment of deals, battens, and spars by steamer from Riga, also some car loads of pine and poplar lumber by regular steamer from New York.
Up to the middle of the week a good business has been done, but the latter portion of the week has been overshadowed by the local trade holidays, which will run well into next week. There is a distinctly improved tone in the market here, and it is expected that after the holidays this will become more pronounced, and that importers will hold out for prices more in accordance with the increased cost of importation.
