HULL DOCK EXTENSION.
The formal opening of the Alexandra Dock extension took place on Tuesday last, when Miss May Poston, the daughter of Mr. Charles Poston, of Highfield, Stepney, a director of the Hull and Barnsley Railway Company, severed the white ribbon, and admitted the first ship. The event was of a semi-private nature, only the directors and their personal friends being present to witness the ceremony. Amongst those present were:—Mr. John Fisher, J.P. (the chairman of the Hull and Barnsley), who was accompanied by Mrs. Fisher, Mr. William Trotter (deputy chairman), Mr. Charles Poston, Mr. Walter Bailey, Mr. W. S. Wright, Mr. Alderman W. Massey, Mr. Lucas, Mr. Villiers, Mr. F. B. Grotrian, Mr. J. Blake Walker (directors), Mr. Vincent Hill (general manager), Mr. A. Nivin (solicitor), Mr. Panley (engineer), Mr. Bland (hydraulic engineer), Mr. W. H. Wood (goods manager), Mr. C. W. B. Anderson (superintendent of the dock), Mr. Captain Jones (dock master). There were also present Mr. J. W. Stuart, J.P., Mr. C. C. Fisher, Mr. Whittaker (contractors), Captain Malet and several ladies. In honour of the occasion the vessels in the Alexandra Dock gaily displayed their bunting, and under the b'azing sun the sight was indeed a pretty and effective one. The new dock extension is intended for coal shipment purposes.

AN INTERESTING WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION CASE.
At Greenock Sheriff Court Friday, 21st inst., Sheriff Begg heard parties' agents in connection with an action that was recently raised at the instance of Matthew Johnston, fitters' helper, residing in Burns' Home, against Carmichael, Maclean & Co., shipbuilders. On 9th February last pursuer, while engaged in the employment of defenders, received injuries whereby he lost the lower joint of his thumb, and was unable to carry on his work. Pursuer raised an action shortly afterwards, and compensation was allowed him at the rate of 12s. 6d. a week until further orders of the Court. Recently pursuer examined by a doctor, who certified that pursuer was now able to do some light work. Defenders made an application to have the Court for a further light order, and offered the pursuer light work at 16s. per week. Sheriff Begg, after hearing the agents, ordered that the pursuer be paid 16s. per week on his entering the employment of the defenders again, and should he be able to take up his usual occupation. Agents: For pursuer, Mr. J. Strathearn, Glasgow; for defenders, Mr. A. Niven.
