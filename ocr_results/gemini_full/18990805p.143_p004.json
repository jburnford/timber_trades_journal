The case was adjourned.\n\nBURCHELL, J. S., builders' merchant, 37, Walbrook, E.C.—A sitting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Linklater.\nIt appeared that the debtor for some years past traded as a builders' merchant, and since August, 1898, also as a builder, under the style of \"Waters & Co.,\" his place of business since the latter date having been at 37, Walbrook.\nHe had no capital when he commenced as a builder, but has from time to time received advances (amounting together to about £445) from a relative.\nThe debtor further stated that about August, 1898, he entered into a building agreement for the erection of 18 houses at Chingford Road, Walthamstow; that eight of the houses were nearly roofed in, but that owing to want of means he was unable to complete the work.\nHe denied that he was insolvent, and attributed his failure to pressure by creditors.\nThe unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £222 19s 3d., and debts fully secured £2,116 2s. 7d., with an estimated surplus, subject to realization, of £967 9s. 3d.\nIn the opinion of the Official Receiver the value of the assets was very much over-stated.\nMr E. S. Grey attended as Assistant Receiver, and the examination was concluded.\n\nCOCKRELL, WILLIAM JAMES, builder, and contractor, carrying on business at 1, Gravel Road, Donnithorne Estate, Twickenham, and residing at 4, Home Road, Twickenham.—The Official Receiver for the Twickenham district has now issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the debtor has filed a statement of affairs, showing\n\nJERE KAYE & CO.
