FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

ADAM, GEORGE, builder, North Shields.—Debtor appeared at the Newcastle Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week.
In the course of examination, that he contracted to build a villa at Rothbury for Mr. Wilson, which was not to cost more than £1,000, but it cost double that amount.
Nearly the whole of the assets were locked up, and had they been easily realisable he had no doubt he should have been able to avoid bankruptcy.
The bank were his unsecured creditors to the extent of £500, and it was their stoppage of his credit about a month ago which led to his insolvency. The case was adjourned.

BURCHELL, J. S., builders' merchant, 37, Walbrook, E.C.—A sitting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Linklater.
It appeared that the debtor for some years past traded as a builders' merchant, and since August, 1898, also as a builder, under the style of "Waters & Co.," his place of business since the latter date having been at 37, Walbrook.
He had no capital when he commenced as a builder, but has from time to time received advances (amounting together to about £445) from a relative.
The debtor further stated that about August, 1898, he entered into a building agreement for the erection of 18 houses at Chingford Road, Walthamstow; that eight of the houses were nearly roofed in, but that owing to want of means he was unable to complete the work.
He denied that he was insolvent, and attributed his failure to pressure by creditors.
The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £222 19s 3d., and debts fully secured £2,116 2s. 7d., with an estimated surplus, subject to realization, of £967 9s. 3d.
In the opinion of the Official Receiver the value of the assets was very much over-stated.
Mr E. S. Grey attended as Assistant Receiver, and the examination was concluded.

COCKRELL, WILLIAM JAMES, builder, and contractor, carrying on business at 1, Gravel Road, Donnithorne Estate, Twickenham, and residing at 4, Home Road, Twickenham.—The Official Receiver for the Twickenham district has now issued particulars under this failure, from which it appears that the debtor has filed a statement of affairs, showing

gross liabilities amounting to £1,154 16s. 3d., and assets nil.
At the first meeting of creditors held on Thursday afternoon at the offices of the Official Receiver, Temple Avenue, E.C., it was formally resolved to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration in the usual manner.

EKE, R., builder, Cambridge Villas, Hither Green, Lewisham.—The first meeting of the creditors interested under this failure, took place on Monday last at the Greenwich offices of the Official Receiver for the London Bridge, S.E., Railway Approach, under the presidency of Mr. Acheson, assistant receiver.
The statement of affairs filed disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £2,111 17s. 1d., of which £411 17s. 1d. was due to unsecured creditors, and £1,700 to fully secured creditors, the value of the securities being estimated at £1,800.
The assets consisted of this surplus of £100.
Mr. Eke alleged his failure to have been caused as follows:—"Loss of materials, tools, machinery, &c., by fire at Rhyme Road, Lewisham, about a year ago (about £100), and increase in price of materials and wages and cost of living, while I had no profit or income."
After some discussion it was formally resolved to leave the estate in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration in the usual manner.

GLASS, J., builder, Tolworth.—At the Kingston Bankruptcy Court on Friday, this bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy.
It was stated this debtor commenced business as a builder with a capital of only £38, which he had saved at his previous employment as a carpenter.
He had taken up several contracts at a price which made it impossible for him to carry the work out at a profit.
After he failed he had gone back to his original employment, in which he was now engaged.
It was understood that only a dividend of 4½d. in the pound had been paid.
His Honour sternly censured the debtor, and suspended his discharge for four years.

GREGORY JOHN, and GREGORY JAMES, builders, Anthony, Horsell.—The statement of affairs filed show gross liabilities amounting to £2,616 1s. 11d., of which were expected to rank, £1,136 1s. 11d., leaving a deficiency of £353 9s. 9d.
At the examination at the Kingston Bankruptcy Court, it was stated that debtors commenced business together in 1895 with a capital of £50.
They owed their insolvency to loss on contracts and sale of houses, depreciation of stock, and the death of two of their horses.
Debtors' wives claim part of the household furniture.
Examination adjourned.

GUERNEY, URBAN, joiner and builder, Tower Street, Leicester.—The adjourned public examination of the above-named debtor took place at the Leicester Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Ingram, on Friday last.
The Official Receiver said the examination had been adjourned for two reasons: (1) The debtor was required to file an account showing what timber and other goods had been delivered to him since March 3rd, when debtor had a fire on the premises, and what he had done with those goods; and (2) he was required to give the address of someone to whom £100 had been recently paid, which address, he said, he was unable to give on the last occasion.
The account asked for was now produced, and the Official Receiver complained that it was completed the previous day only.
The Official Receiver said this account had been made out too late; there had not been time to verify the list.
He asked debtor if he could now tell them the address required.
Debtor replied that he had made inquiries, but could not find the address; he had done his best, he could not find the man.
After some questions, the Official Receiver asked the Registrar to make an order for the address required, Bennett being the name of the man.
There was no doubt, he said, that debtor could find the address if he took the trouble.
The Registrar ordered the debtor to supply the address required, on or before August 4th.
The examination was adjourned, and debtor was ordered to supply an account of work done.

LILLIE, A. E., LTD., timber merchants, Portsmouth.—A petition has been presented to the High Court under the Companies' Act for winding up of the above company, and the same is to be heard on the 9th inst.

NEWMAN & JAMES, contractors, Cardiff.—On Friday, at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court, debtors attended for their adjourned public examination before Mr. Registrar Cousins.
Mr Lewis Morgan appeared for debtors, and Mr. James, one of the debtors, now explained the transactions the firm had had in the matter of the houses they had built.
Mrs. Newman had advanced several sums of money—without receipts or acknowledgment of any kind for them.
Mrs. James had also advanced money to the firm, and both ladies had held houses built by the firm.
Debtors had inherited some money from their father since they started business, and part of the money they received by them from the ladies.
Neither Mrs. Newman nor Mrs. James had got any acknowledgment of any kind for the advances, and neither the one nor the other had benefited in any way by the loans they had given.
They had, in fact, lost all.—The examination was formally adjourned.

ROBERTS, GRIFFITH, builder and contractor, Benar View, Blaenau, Festiniog.—At the adjourned public examination of this debtor at the July sitting of the Festiniog Bankruptcy Court, debtor said he considered his failure to be partly due to his having supplied a better class of work in several contracts than was required by the specification.
He admitted that before taking the last contract he was engaged upon he could not pay 20s. in the £.
His wife had private means.
The examination was eventually closed.
