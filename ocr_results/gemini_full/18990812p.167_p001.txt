Liverpool method of business in the tim-trade.
Spruce still continues very firm, influenced this so largely by the strong attitude of the freight market.
Of the position of the latter we cannot put the matter in a stronger light than to refer our readers to the quota-tions and actual transactions set forth in the special columns of this paper.
The brokers appear to be in a most indifferent mood for entering into transactions for the future if they are based upon conditions which in-clude freight.
Not that they cannot obtain steamers at a price, for this will always bring its age, but the price asked for medium sized ships is such that few are willing to touch the same as we have said before in the case with pitch pine timber, both sawn and hewn.
On this subject we may just say that few arrivals have come to hand, and the stocks in store are beginning to wear a reduced appearance.
Two or three cargoes of red deals from the Baltic have arrived this week, and should come to a good market, as the stocks have been greatly lowered of late of favourite dimensions of good qualities.
United States woods, such as oak wagon sidings, hickory, ash, &c., in the log have arrived very freely by the steamers from Baltimore, Newport News, &c., and at pre-sent the market seems to be overdone with these woods.
Mahogany and Hardwoods.
Until the forthcoming sales of mahogany, which are held the week after next, we do not expect to see anything of particular in-terest in this branch of our trade.

In the meantime, as the yards are cleared of old stocks, and for some they will not be sorry, the spaces will give them room for the new arrivals.
These are now coming into the hands of Alfred Dobell & Co., who are now busy receiving a cargo of logs of Honduras mahogany, and various parcels from the West Coast and other steamers.
A large portion of the arrivals are being carted to Edward Chaloner & Co.'s premises, whose sale will be confined to this class of wood, nothing from other quarters intervening between now and the date of their sale.
We may here remind our readers that the dates fixed for the forthcoming sales are the Thursday, the 24th, for that of Alfred Dobell & Co., and the following day, Friday, the 25th, for Edward Chaloner & Co.'s collection of wood.
Next week we shall give in our usual report upon the various woods to be offered.

MUNICIPAL CARPENTRY AND JOINERY AT CARDIFF.
At Cardiff, this week, the Corporation Health Committee have received a deputation from the Associated Carpenters and Joiners Society, asking that all carpentry and joinery work done by the Corporation workmen should be en-trusted to properly trained craftsmen.
In the course of the proceedings it was argued that of the 200 to 300 local members of the Society, 500 at least were ratepayers.
It was unfair to them that carpentry should be done by wheel-wrights, and moreover, under the conditions desired the work would be more efficiently and economically done.
The committee authorised the chairman to ascertain from the official engaging employees, whether it was enough for the Corporation work to keep a joiner or joiners regularly employed.
