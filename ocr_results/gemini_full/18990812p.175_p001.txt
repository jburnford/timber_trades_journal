SPECIFICATIONS.
We have received from Mr. Louis Bamberger a copy of his Pocket Buildings, the usual useful information of the firm's stock of timber, being given. The principal items in the very extensive list of dry season goods are American hardwoods, walnut, American whitewood, but we notice Mr. Bamberger is well supplied in White Sea goods, both firsts and seconds from Onega and Archangel ports. The list of July's. Breakey's, and other Canadian goods. All qualities of pine in deals are specified, including 1st broads and 2nds and 3rds of 3x11, Hawkesbury & Co.'s pine slating. Ordinary stock is represented by 3x9 yellow deals, 2x9, 8 and 7 inch, and 2x7 and 1x7 yellow and white. We have mentioned the prominent lines—but, of course, the list contains other descriptions of both sawn and planed stuffs—and the advantages are amply filled. The firm are always carrying a well-assorted stock of dry stuff in woods suitable for the carriage trade, which forms a large branch of their business.
At 79½, Gracechurch-street, have a well-covered priced specification in which they appear to hold a fairly big stock of White Sea 3rds being prominent. There is also an attractive feature in the list that there are fair lines of 2x3 up to 2x11 red Finnish. We notice a line of 2x4 red for building purposes among other sizes which are moderately priced, and which are also as plentiful in the stock as usual. There is also a big assortment of pine deals from 4in. downwards. Pine sidings are given as usual form a substantial item in the stock. This, together with flooring...

BRISTOL CHANNEL TIMBER IMPORTERS' ASSOCIATION.
This Association held a meeting, this last week, at the Angel Hotel, Cardiff, Councillor Robinson (Robin & Co., Limited, Cardiff) presiding. The chief business had reference to the payment of accounts. At present the terms are 2½ per cent. discount for a month, but it was stated that buyers often did not take complete delivery of their goods for months after the order was given, although they paid within a month of the delivery of the last load, expected to save the discount. This was held to be unfair, and it was unanimously resolved that all goods sold under contract and not taken by the buyers within the month in which they were sold, should be invoiced to them and payment date from that time. Another important subject which was discussed was with regard to a clause which some shipping agents were inserting in their charter forms, and which was to the effect that in the event of war in which any of the Great Powers or the United States are engaged, the owners shall have the option of cancelling the contract. This clause, in the opinion of the meeting, was held to be very unfair to importers, as the attendance was very large, it was deemed advisable to postpone the matter until the next meeting.
