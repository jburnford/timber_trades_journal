He was conveyed to the Cottage Hospital, semi-unconscious, and in a critical condition.\n\nRECENT PATENT.\nMITREING.\nThis patent relates to a machine for planing the mitres of picture frames and the like. In the plan shown in Fig. 2, the mouldings to be planed are fixed on the slides B, the outer ends of the mouldings being placed against stops L to fix the length. The opposite ends of the mouldings are planed by plane-irons C in a slide M reciprocated by a crank E and connecting rod F. The slides B are fed forward by levers F which are actuated by a treadle H connected to the levers by cords G. The plane-irons C are of considerable depth, and the table on which the mouldings are supported can be raised or lowered by a screw and hand-wheel M1, so as to use successively the whole of the edge. The travel of the guides B is regulated by a pin and slot. Campbell & Sons and R. Wilkinson, Silvergrove Works, Silvergrove Street, Glasgow, are the patentees.\n\nGAZETTE.\nThe examination of Johnston Hamilton M'Genn, builder, of Blairhill, Coatbridge, trading as J. & H. M'Genn, was held in the Sheriff's Chambers, County Buildings, Airdrie, yesterday.\n\nThe creditors of Wm. M'Ewan, joiner, of Motherwell, are to meet in the Royal Hotel, Hamilton, on Friday next.\n\nA. & J. Cunningham, cabinet-makers, Kilmarnock, and Alexander Cunningham and James Cunningham, both cabinet-makers there, the sole partners of the company, as such partners, and as individuals are to be examined in the Sheriff Court House, Kilmarnock, on Wednesday next, at eleven o'clock.\n\nThe following is a copy of a circular which was issued on Friday to the creditors of James Young & Sons, contractors, Bryson Road, Edinburgh:—\"33 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, 4th August, 1899. Gentlemen,—We beg to inform you that at the request of the committee of creditors appointed at the meeting held on 4th ult., James Young & Sons, contractors, Bryson Road, Edinburgh, and Robert Young, contractor, Edinburgh, the sole surviving partner of the firm, have to-day signed a trust deed in favour of our Mr. J. Stuart Gowans, C.A., for behoof of the creditors. We are preparing a state of affairs with the view of submitting it to a meeting of creditors to be held on an early day. In order that the state may be as accurate as possible, we have to request the favour of your sending us a statement of your claim in course of post. The firm have granted a mandate to apply for sequestration, but it appears to us to be in the interests of the creditors that the estate should, if possible, be wound up under the trust deed instead of under sequestration. Several of the creditors have used arrestments, and these must be withdrawn, otherwise sequestration will be taken out. We shall, of course, do everything in our power to prevent any preferences being obtained.—We are, your obedient servants, A. & J. ROBERTSON, C.A.\"\n\nFIRE AT LEITH.—A great fire broke out on Thursday at Wills' Asphalte Stores, Leith, and spread to the extensive works of Hawthorns, Ltd., shipbuilders. Messrs. Wilds' premises were gutted, and much damage was done at Hawthorns'.\n\nROYAL ARBORICULTURAL SOCIETY EXCURSION.\nThe Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society brought their three days' excursion in the North of Scotland to a close on Friday last. The excursion has been one of a most successful nature. The weather has been all that could be desired, and the visit to a portion of the country which many of the party has never before visited has been, in the opinion of all, not only a pleasurable but a profitable character. The members were on the road by rising had again to be practised, for the men had breakfast and were on the road by eight o'clock. The drive was by Golspie Station, near to which is a saw mill and creosote work, both of which were visited. The latter is largely used in preparing wood for fences on the extensive Dunrobin estates, and sleepers for the Highland Railway Company. It is one of the small industries which are encouraged by the ducal family. The drive was continued over the Mound, a work by Telfor, which crosses the shallow end of Loch Fleet, and connects the two shores of that arm of the sea. Once over this great embankment the party proceeded through a beautiful birch wood, inspected the ruins of Skelbo Castle, and walked up Skelbo Glen, where the young plantings included a large number of Douglas fir, Picea nobilis, and Thuja lobbis. Skelbo and Balvraid Woods were next inspected. In one side of the wood the trees had been clean cut out. It was explained that at first only a partial thinning had been made in the hope that natural regeneration would take place. It was found, however, that although plenty of seed fell, the carpet of moss and vegetation was too thick for it to root in, and the whole area, accordingly, is to be artificially replanted. A fine clump of Douglas fir, growing thickly together in rather an exposed situation, was much admired in a corner of this wood. Through a splendidly wooded country the party proceeded to Dornoch, where, under the leadership of Mr M'Hardy, Chief Constable of Inverness, formerly Chief Constable of Sutherlandshire, they walked over a part of the grand golf links, which are certainly second to none in the country. It may be rated to mention that it was Mr. M'Hardy who in 1872 started golf in Dornoch, to which the old and pleasantly-situated burgh now owes so much of its prosperity.\nThe party were entertained to luncheon in the Sutherland Arms by Mr. Andrew Carnegie of Skibo, who had invited the members of the society to visit him at his new estate in the afternoon. Lord Mansfield proposed Mr. Carnegie's health, and, as this was the last time the company would be all together, Mr. D. Laird (who has efficiently acted as convener of the Arrangements Committee) thanked, on behalf of the Society, Lord Mansfield and Mr. Munro Ferguson of Novar for their attendance at the excursion. He assured them that it had been a great pleasure to success to have had them with them. Lord Mansfield said it had been a great pleasure to him to be with the Society on its annual excursion, and Mr. Munro Ferguson remarked that he thought they would be able to look back on their closing excursion of the century with a great deal of pleasure, as one of the most profitable the society had had. Taking carriages again, the company drove to Skibo Castle, where they were cordially welcomed by Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie. Skibo Castle stands on a beautiful natural situation on the shores of the Dornoch Firth, surrounded on all sides by the fine woodlands which add greatly to the attractiveness of the landscape. Over the Castle was floating a flag which combined the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes, and though owing to the extensive additions to the mansion at present in progress, which are to cost something like £40,000, the home policies were not seen to advantage, the other parts of the estate visited had many points of interest. The Skibo estate as recently extended by Mr. Carnegie is a country over 30 miles in length by 17 miles in width, and on this territory, which includes fertile farms and moor, there are five thousands acres of wood, chiefly of Scots fir and larch, from 50 to 100 years old. Mr. Carnegie, in welcoming the society to Skibo, commented on the objects which he said were worthy of their study. Referring to the combination flag over the Castle, he remarked that he was in favour of the union of the Presbyterian Churches of Scotland and of the Anglo-Saxon race, the latter sentiment eliciting a hope from him and he further expressed a hope when they got things in order at Skibo the Society would pay him another visit. A pleasing incident occurred at this stage of the proceedings, which the members witnessed with much interest. One of the older men of the party, Mr. Philip, wood merchant, Inverurie, was introduced to Mr. Carnegie, who was reminded that gentleman that they had been at school together. Mr. Carnegie recalled their juvenile relationship, and invited Mr. Philip to the Castle to have a quiet chat over old times. Later in the afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie entertained the company on the lawn, a piper, wearing the noble Carnegie tartan, meanwhile discoursing music in front of the Castle. Among the Skibo party present in addition to Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie, were Mr. and Mrs. A. King and the Misses King, New York; Mr. and Mrs. Veats-Thomson, London; and Mr. Lloyd, Birmingham. The estate officials present were Mr. James Bertram, secretary; Mr. Macdonald, forester; and Mr. Hamilton, gardener. A photograph of the whole party was taken at the door of the Castle, and before leaving Mr. Laird called for three cheers for the laird of Skibo, Mrs. Carnegie, and family. This was followed in response to this sentiment, which Mr. Carnegie in a word cordially acknowledged.\nThe bulk of the party thereafter drove through the Skibo estate along the well wooded shores of the Dornoch Firth to Bonar Bridge Station, and caught the evening train for Inverness. After dinner in the Station Hotel there, Mr. Michie, her Majesty's forester, Balmoral, took occasion to refer to the death of Mr. Dunn, Dalkeith, who had for so many years been the leader of their excursions, and to say how much they had missed him. Votes of thanks were proposed by Mr. Cook, factor, Arniston, to Mr. David Laird, and to the secretary of the society, Mr. Robert Galloway, whose admirable arrangements for the comfort of the party had contributed so much to the success of the excursion.\n\nF.
