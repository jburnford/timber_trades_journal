The gross liabilities were £834 3s. 6d., due to 54 unsecured creditors, who were expected to rank, and £24 7s. 6d. due to preferential creditors. The net assets were estimated at £58 4s., leaving a deficiency of £775 19s. 6d. The timber trade creditors are:—\n£ s. d.\nRobinson, David & Co., Cardiff 10 18 4\nRobbins & Co., Bristol 12 16 5\nW Wibby & Co., Gloucester 54 7 0\nHopton & Sons, London 21 14 6\nMr. T. J. Hughes appeared for debtor, and Mr. D. W. Jones, Merthyr, for the purchaser of defendant's business. Failure was attributed to loss of trade owing to the great Welsh coal strike, domestic responsibilities, and personal illness. Debtor, according to his replies to the Official Receiver, had gone into the wheelwright affair about nine years ago. He had also been otherwise engaged during the last five years. He had no capital of his own when he started, but he borrowed £100 from his father which had not been repaid, and for which he had returned him an unsecured creditor. Over £300 of his debts were now due for money lent. He kept no banking account nor any books, with the exception of a ledger shewing the debts due to the estate. The Official Receiver examined debtor very rigorously on what he considered the extraordinary amount of interest on money borrowed, and debtor admitted that he had not realised what extravagant figures these sums totalled. The course taken in some cases appeared to have been to have debited debtor with a certain figure as a loan, but to have really handed him over only a moiety of that sum. When he borrowed, say, £66, he really only received £50. He borrowed from various firms in Cardiff, Swansea, and Bristol, at an average of [?] a week. If he had not borrowed in this way he did not think he could have carried on. His outgoings upon his father, mother\n\nSTREET PAVING,\nJARRAH, KARRI,\nAND OTHER AUSTRALIAN HARDWOODS.\nSole Agents [?]\nTELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS—\"CHURCHILL, LONDON.\"\nTELEPHONE No. 1417.",
