ALLEN, DAVID, wheelwright, &c., 106, Bute Street, Treherbert, Glam.-The public examination of the above debtor was held on Tuesday at the Pontypridd Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Spickett. The gross liabilities were £384 5s. 6d., due to 34 unsecured creditors, who were expected to rank, and £24 7s. 6d. due to preferential creditors. The net assets were estimated at £58 4s., leaving a deficiency of £775 19s. 6d. The timber trade creditors are:-

Jones & Co., Cardiff 10 18 4
Robinson, David & Co., Cardiff 12 16 5
Robbins & Co., Bristol 34 7 0
W. Wibby & Co., Gloucester 21 14 6
Mr. T. J. Hughes appeared for debtor, and Mr. Spickett for Merthyr, for the purchaser of the business. Failure was attributed owing to the great Welsh coal strike, domestic responsibilities, and personal illness. Debtor, according to his replies to the Official Receiver, had gone into business about nine years ago. He was otherwise engaged during the last five years. He had no capital of his own when he started, but he borrowed £100 from his father which had not been repaid, and for which he had given him an unsecured note. Over £300 of his debts were now due for money lent. He kept no banking account nor any books, with the exception of a ledger shewing the debts due to the estate. The Official Receiver examined debtor very rigorously on what he considered the extraordinary amount of interest on money borrowed, and debtor admitted that he had not realised what extravagant figures these sums totalled. The court appeared to have been taken in some cases apparently with a certain figure as a loan, but to have really handed him a lesser sum. When he borrowed £66, he really only received £50. He borrowed from various firms in Cardiff, Swansea, and Bristol. His usual average of repayment was figured at £1 a week.

and himself, ran up to about £4 a week. The receipts for the six months prior to filing, amounted to £516 3s. 1d., against payments for the same amount. The goods account totalled £579 3s. 6d., and the sales since January 5th, £510 10s. 11d.; stock-in-hand at the commencing date, £300; purchases since, £576 8s. 5d. The trading expenses were estimated at £202 15s., and the stock-in-hand at the date of the receiving order, £9 19s. 6d. The examination was closed.

BEECH, HERBERT, builder, Aintree. A meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday at the office of the Official Receiver, Victoria Street, Liverpool. Mr. Ring, assistant Official Receiver, presided over a good attendance of creditors. Mr. Kent (Newman & Kent) and Mr. H. C. Reynolds represented creditors. It was reported by Mr. Ring that the unsecured liabilities amounted to £811 11s. 3d. There were creditors fully secured representing £9,498 16s. 6d., and they held securities of the estimated value of £10,028 8s. 3d., leaving a surplus of £529 11s. 9d. The assets, including the surplus of securities, amounted to £839 19s. 6d., leaving an apparent surplus of assets over liabilities of £28 8s. 3d. The debtor, who was 23 years of age, commenced business as a joiner and builder in September, 1898, in partnership with a Mr. John McClusky, putting in £90 of capital. The partnership was dissolved in November, 1898, the debtor taking over the assets and liabilities. According to the statement of the debtor, he had built and completed 12 houses at Fazakerley, sold a chief rent on them for £1,040, and mortgaged them to a Mr. Connery, of Manchester, for £2,080. The debtor had partly built ten more, and stated they were worth for work done £1,700, but he had not taken up the title. The debtor had also contracted to take land for 50 more houses in the same place, but had not commenced to erect buildings upon it. The debtor's alleged cause of failure was inability to obtain advances. No offer was made on behalf of the debtor, and it was resolved to wind up the estate in bankruptcy. Mr. Thomas Tranter, chartered accountant, 24, North John Street, Liverpool, was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection.

BRADING, THOMAS, builder, Ventnor. The statement of affairs filed herein discloses gross liabilities £2,759 18s. 4d., of which £1,066 15. 1d. is due to unsecured creditors and £1,650 to creditors fully secured, and net assets £614 10s. 4d., showing a deficiency of £452 4s. 9d. The debtor alleges as the cause of failure—'Bad debts, losses on contracts, and want of capital.' The Official Receiver's observations are:—The debtor commenced business in June, 1891, with out capital. He appears to have purchased and rebuilt in 1893 the premises at Grove Road, Ventnor, in which he has since resided and carried on business. The creditor returned as fully secured is the debtor's banker. Numerous legal proceedings were taken against the debtor during the three months preceding the receiving order, an execution for about £70 having been levied and paid out on the 21st June last, and at the date of the receiving order the Sheriff was in possession under an execution for £13. In reply to the preliminary questions the debtor states that he was not aware of his insolvency until the last execution was levied, which was eight days before the receiving order. He has not kept a cash account, nor completed the deficiency account. The debtor has lodged a proposal for a composition of 10s. in the £, payable by four equal instalments of 2s. 6d. each, viz.: The first on the 1st October next, the second on the 1st January next, the third on the 1st April next, and the fourth on the 1st July next. It is proposed to secure the composition by vesting estate in the Official Receiver until composition is paid.

GORDON, WILLIAM MAXWELL, timber merchant, Moscow Drive, Liverpool.—The above-named debtor presented himself for public examination on Thursday last, at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Bellringer, and after he had been questioned by Mr. Quiggin on behalf of the creditors, respecting his accounts, it was decided to adjourn the examination until October, and in the meantime debtor was requested to amend his deficiency account.

HIND, FRANK, contractor, timber dealer, &c., 'Wood-side,' Belvedere, near Erith, Kent, and other places, has filed his petition in the Rochester Bankruptcy Court, and a receiving order has been made. The first meeting of creditors is fixed for Monday, and the public examination for Thursday next. The summary of debtor's affairs gives the gross liabilities at £7,731 14s., and the deficiency is given at £6,169 3s. 10d. The causes of failure are stated to be losses on contracts, rising in prices of both material and labour, and heavy interest on loans. Debtor commenced business about ten years since at Heron Hill, Belvedere, without capital, and he has since added the several other businesses. For the past three years he has done a very extensive trade, and has borrowed large amounts from his relations and others. According to his statement the loans exceed £3,000, and there is an over-draft at the bank of £299 odd. The bank hold certain securities for this, and another creditor holds a life policy as security for some £700. At the time of the receiving order debtor was building a number of houses at Belvedere and Dartford Heath. At one time debtor had freehold property, but he sold that, and now is tenant of the same. He has been sued by several creditors recently. He has kept various books of account, but they are not complete.

HURST, STEPHEN, builder and contractor, Putney, Mortlake, and Brondesbury.—The first meeting of creditors under this failure was held on Monday at the London Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Howell, Assistant Receiver. The debtor had filed accounts showing gross liabilities £28,395 17s., of which £1,635 17s. are expected to rank, against assets valued at £6,292 17s. 6d., or sufficient to yield a surplus of about £1,600 after payment of all claims. He states that he has been engaged, on and off, in speculative building operations since 1868. In 1883 he filed a petition for liquidation, and obtained a discharge from the previous week. If he had known he would have to pay he did not think he would have carried on so long. His outgoings upon his father, mother,
