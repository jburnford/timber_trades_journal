TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
The arrivals since last writing have been
light, consisting of one liner from Montreal,
the "Buenos Ayrean," with 150 standards
pine deals for Edmiston & Mitchells, which
have been sold ex quay, and 25 standards
spruce deals for Wright, Graham & Co., and
the "Hestia," from Baltimore, with im-
portant consignments of hardwoods in log and
plank, for various consignees, details of
which will be found in list of imports.
A good demand exists at present for nearly all
hardwoods, there is every prospect of the
most of this import being disposed of from
ship's side. Some considerable deliveries
to buyers have already been made.
The "Keeman," from Newport News,
has also arrived, and is discharging 154 oak
logs, 52 walnut logs, 17 oak logs, and a large
quantity of whitewood boards, Carolina pine
boards, oak planks, &c., to several con-
nees, details of which will be given next
week.
The scarcity of mahogany in this market
has been unprecedented, and as there has
been an active enquiry for it, the trade will
be interested to learn that a cargo of Tabasco
wood per "Emily A. Davies," from
Laguna, is on the way here from port of call,
and will be sold at an early date by Calder,
Henderson & Livingston.
Trade continues good in all branches, and
deliveries from the yards are well main-
tained. The import list totals for the past

week amount to 11,680 loads to Glasgow,
6,835 to Greenock, and 11,020 to Grange-
mouth.

GREENOCK.
The only cargo of wood goods to hand this
week is that per the "Queen of the East"
(1,269), from Dalhousie, with 54,053 pieces
deals and ends, for James Hunter, Glasgow,
and will be forwarded per lighter to Bowling
for Singer's Co.
There are several cargoes on the homeward
list, which should arrive here about the end
of next week.
No public sales are advertised at present.

LEITH.
There has been only a small importation
of wood during the past week, consisting
merely of a steamer cargo of deals and
battens from St. Petersburg, a sailer cargo
of oak staves from Memel, and a small cargo
of firewood from Arendal.
A fair business has been done, however,
during the week, and there is a general
consensus of opinion among merchants that
with the increased cost of importation an
advance in spot prices must be obtained
forthwith. Garland & Roger, Ltd., held a
public sale on Tuesday, 15th inst., at their
Railway Yard, and indications were not
wanting that the exposers were resolved to
hold for some improvement in values of all
the better qualities and current dimensions
of Baltic deals and battens. In consequence
of this various parcels had to be passed over,

but buyers actually requiring eventually
paid the reasonable limits indicated by the
exposers, and more business resulted than
at first seemed likely. A very nice ship-
ment of the B S 1st & 2nd 8 C redwood goods
fetched excellent prices, such superior
quality being rarely offered at auctions.
