RECENT PATENTS.
FURNITURE WITH DETACHABLE PARTS.
This patent, which cannot fail to be of interest to cabinet makers, carpenters, &c., has been granted to Mr. J. Robertson, of 38, Regent Park Square, Strathbungo, Glasgow, N.B. The principal parts of tables, chairs, washstands, wardrobe cabinets, drawers, receptacles, bookcases, counters, wall fittings, &c., are united together, and, when required, to buildings, by peg and hole joints, which allow of easy detachment for storage, &c., and dispense with the use of glue, nails, &c.

203
parts are tightly jammed between the supports A. The pilasters H are made with strips h1 attached by screws h2 to the supports A. Framed or other backs, &c., such as D2, Fig. 26, or D, Fig. 2, are attached by pegged strips b1, screws, catches, &c., b1 preventing displacement of the parts. Fig. 38 shows an application to chairs, &c., the top piece B with pegged strips B1, being strengthened on the underside by one or two strips b3. Each strip b1 has at least one screw-threaded peg n15, and if this peg is screw-threaded throughout its whole length and inserted in a screw-threaded hole in the supports A, A2, or A3, and strip b1, it remains secure in the strip b1 after withdrawal from the part a9, preventing loss. Fig. 45 shows another arrangement for a bench or a table, similar parts referring to similar parts already described. Fig. 31 shows a drawer, the bottom p1 fitting into grooves f2 or supported on ledges f3, Fig. 34, running or bearing on a f5 being secured to the bottom f2. Fig. 19 shows a wardrobe, &c., the drawer F having dust excluding strips A3 fitted to the parts A. The parts f2, A4, a1, p1, n15, n2, may be made either of metal or wood.
BOXES.
Mr. T. Kay, of 21, Cathedral Street, Glasgow, has been granted a patent whereby the parts of wooden packing or shipping cases, which may be tongued and grooved, are secured by a thin solution of colloid or what is known as "scoli" liquid glue, so that any tampering with the cases may be detected.
GREENOCK TRADES COUNCIL AND LOCAL CONTRACTS.
At a recent meeting of the Electricity Committee of Greenock Police Board, the Town Clerk submitted a letter from the Trades Council, pointing out that estimates had been asked from local joiners to make a quantity of protection boxes for electric plant, and the contract had been given to a Port-Glasgow firm who were employing labourers to do the work, and protesting against this method of giving out public work as being unfair to employer and employed. The electrical engineer explained that the Police Board had not asked for the estimates referred to. The committee agreed that the Town Clerk should acknowledge the receipt of the letter, and to inform the Trades Council that the Police Board had not contracted for the work referred to.
FATAL ACCIDENT.—A carter in the employment of Reynolds & M'Queen, builders, Stirling, was killed on Tuesday at St Ninians, his own cart having gone over him.
