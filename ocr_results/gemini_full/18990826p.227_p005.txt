The debtor's wife claimed the lease of 4, Windsor Gardens, together with the whole of the furniture, on the ground that she had purchased same with monies left her by her mother and her former husband.
The Official Receiver was appointed trustee of the estate.
The Chairman stated that probably there would be an application made to remove the proceedings from the Croydon to the Greenwich County Court, and that although the debtor's public examination was fixed for August 30th at the Croydon County Court, he did not think it would be held on that date.
He had requested the debtor to file a cash account showing his transactions during the past two years.
The meeting, after further desultory discussion, was concluded.

This debtor had paid the money into the bank in the usual way.
INGRAM, WM. BOE, South Shields.—This debtor came up for his first examination at the Newcastle Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week, before Mr. Registrar Dendv.
Interrogated by the Official Receiver, he stated that for the past five years he had been a builder.
He commenced business with a sum of £500 left him by his father.
He built 13 houses in Marsden Street, four of which were not yet sold.
He had also built in Imery Street and Osborne Avenue.
The houses were sold by the bank, who were mortgagees, at a loss.
He lost money over building contracts, through the agreements not containing a strike clause.
Whilst he was building a dispute arose between the plasterers and the other section of men, and he was unable to fulfil his contracts.
The examination was adjourned.

The alleged cause of failure is the want of capital, bad debts, loss on contracts at Alton, and speculative building.

LOMAS, THOMAS HENRY, late builder, Holme Road, Burnley.—This debtor made an application for his discharge at the Burnley Bankruptcy Court on Saturday.
The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £1,691, and assets available for distribution among the creditors £496.
A dividend of 9 1/2d. in the pound had been paid to the unsecured creditors.
The Official Receiver, in his report, commented very strongly on the fact that the debtor commenced building houses at Earby without any capital whatever.
He did not even let the work by contract, but had carried it out under his own direction, without any personal knowledge whatever of building operations.
The result was that he lost enormously by the speculation.
His Honour said he was bound to mark his sense of the rash and hazardous speculation entered into by the debtor by suspending his discharge for four years.
MATTHEWS, HENRY F., builder, Seaview.—The debtor, in reply to the Deputy Official Receiver (Mr. W. C. Black), at the Isle of Wight Bankruptcy Court last week, stated

The bankrupt was examined at length concerning a transaction with his son, a lad of 14, in Nov., 1897, when he sold to him his jobbing business for £100, and continued speculating on his own behalf.
It also appeared the bankrupt had entered into building agreements himself and had the leases made out to his son.
He had also sold the goods used in building for the goods went into his son's name.
He admitted that four houses ago he was then about solvent, but he did not balance again.
He only kept a debtor's ledger.
The Registrar said the matter was very unsatisfactory, and he did not believe some of the bankrupt's statements.
Mr. Godwin, the bankrupt's solicitor, examined him at length, and the O.R. intimated that he would not ask for an adjournment.
The Registrar agreed and made an order closing the examination.
PAINE, HENRY, builder, Sheerness.—The Official Receiver for the Rochester and Chatham districts (Mr. R. T. Tatham) has just issued his statement as regards the above bankruptcy, in reference to his receipts and payments as trustee of the estate.
The debtor carried on business at Winstanley Road, Sheerness, as a dealer in timber, builder, and contractor, having considerable dealings with Sheerness Dockyard.
Although the bankrupt's estate at the time of filing showed about 10s. in the pound, with the help of the Official Receiver, a dividend of 20s. in the pound, owing to completing a Government contract and selling some property and certain other interests.
PASCOE, ARTHUR, builder, Newcastle.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor took place at the Newcastle Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week.
Questioned at some length with regard to 13 sites at Byker, on which he had built houses, debtor alleged that he was really deceived as to the agreements of sale, as after the houses were built, charges were sprung upon him which he was unable to foresee.
The examination was formally adjourned until the next Court.
