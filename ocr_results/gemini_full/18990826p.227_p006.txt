LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.

SEQUEL TO A SALE OF HOME TIMBER.
AT this month's sitting of the Hereford County Court, before Judge Lea and a jury, an important action has been heard in which the plaintiff was Mr. J. T. Hereford, who sued Robert Powell and Arthur J. Thomas, the defendants, for £14 10s., said to be due on a promissory note. There was a counter-claim for £21.—Mr. Woods, for plaintiff, explained that the claim against defendants was as makers of a joint promissory note dated January, 1898, payable October, 1898. With regard to the counter-claim set up, defendants admitted the signature, and he suggested the case should proceed on the counter-claim, and this was agreed to.—Mr. Garrold, for the defendants, pointed out that the amount was for timber sold by auction at Mordiford, and the action was brought, as stated, upon a promissory note given by the two defendants, one of whom, Mr. Powell, was the principal, and Mr. Thomas the surety. A note was given for the purchase of certain growing timber upon the Sufton Estate. The auction was held at Mordiford, on the 31st December, 1897, when Mr. Powell bought one lot of timber, the purchase money was £32 8s., and the defendant paid £3 8s. as deposit and drew two promissory notes for £14 10s. each. As the jury were aware the usual way of paying for growing timber was by giving bills with a surety, payable at a date in the following year. One bill was duly paid, and the second became due on the 1st October, 1898, but this one had not been met. The defendant commenced in the usual way to cut down the timber he had bought, and proceeded with the work until September, when the plaintiff's agent, Mr. P. Pitt, gave notice that he would not allow him to go into the wood any more or take away the remainder of the timber. Mr. Pitt thereupon proceeded to lock the gate of the wood, and so prevented the defendant getting any more timber. The time for closing was the 1st of November, but as they saw, long before that date, the defendant was prevented getting his timber.—Mr. Garrold referred to the conditions of sale, and said they were signed by the defendant, who was a "marksman," by putting his mark to them, they were not binding upon him as they were not read. The counter-claim for damages was made up as follows:—1,000 tied faggots, £3 10s.; 2,000 growing faggots, £5 10s.; 30 oak poles, £3; loss through defendants' horses and men being kept unemployed, £4; loss sustained by Mr. Powell through having to buy goods to supply customers and loss of profit, £5. Mr. Garrold contended that plaintiff had committed an illegal act in seizing and taking possession of the wood before November 1st.—Mr. Woods, for the plaintiff, urged that Mr. Pitt, as agent for the estate, had been bound to put his foot down and see that the contract entered into by purchasers was properly carried out.—After considerable evidence had been given, judgment was given for the plaintiff for the claim, and for the defendants for the counter-claim.

EXEMPTIONS IN CHARTER PARTIES.
AT the City of London Court on Wednesday last week, an action was brought by the Gordon Steamship Company (Limited), Crosby Square, for the recovery of the sum of £17 12s. against the defendants, W. Christie & Co., of 2, Great Winchester Street, for damage done to a vessel while unloading a cargo of timber. Mr. Roche, plaintiffs' counsel, said the point in dispute was of some importance to shippers of timber cargoes. In December last the plaintiffs were the owners of the steamer "Rimpha," which brought a cargo of timber over to this country. When it arrived in Tilbury Docks it was discharged by the defendants, who were not only the charterers, but also the stevedores. The defendants' servants were very negligent in putting the timber overside, and broke away 40 ft. of the rail of the plaintiffs' ship. Now the plaintiffs asked the defendants to pay for making it good. There were certain exceptions in the charter party, and one excepted the defendants from responsibility for any negligence of their servants. The submission to the Court was that that applied only to the contract of carriage which was entered into. Mr. O'Connor, defendants' counsel, said that the defence was that the damage was caused by the plaintiffs' defective gear being used, and that the damage was unavoidable. Captain Welch, plaintiffs' captain, said that was not so. The gear was in a perfectly sound condition. The rail of his ship was not damaged while coming from Danzig. It was true they had rough weather, and that they lost 250 pieces of timber on the voyage, it having been stowed on the deck. Upon their arrival the rail in question was not in any way damaged. It had all been brought about by the defendants' men's negligence in throwing the timber overside. A platform had been erected, and the timber ought to have been placed on that. It was not true to say that the derrick was so badly erected that the timber could not be got plumb over the hold. On the other hand, the defendant, Mr. Christie, said that it was impossible to throw the arm of the derrick out sufficiently to make it clear the side, and at the same time to have it over the hold to avoid the damage. The Assistant Judge (Mr. Julian Robins) said it appeared to him that the exceptions in charter parties were becoming simply frightful. What it was coming to was this: People might put their goods on board ships or trains, and the owners had no concern whether the goods ever arrived at their journey's end or not. It did not affect them at all. Those cases were becoming quite repugnant, strous, and he doubted were not against public policy. The change in charter parties was simply extraordinary. He was very doubtful whether the defendants had not excepted themselves completely from liability; but the question was of much importance, and he would take time to consider his judgment. Both learned counsel intimated that whichever way the case went they would appeal. The case was accordingly adjourned for judgment.

OLD WOODEN CONDUITS.
THE antiquary, who is usually seeking in out-of-the-way spots for something to replenish his store of curiosities, and to furnish records of what used to be, would hardly in the present day expect to find in such well beaten city thoroughfares as Goswell Road and Old Street, within a few inches of the paving stones, any interesting relics of old London. Nevertheless, a very wide field for further researches has recently come to light in the shape of trunks of hollowed out trees that have evidently served the purpose of conduits in former times. In Goswell Road, men working for the National Telephone Company, paving close to the corner of Old Street, have discovered these crude cylinders of timber embedded in the dark resting place where they had been placed ages ago, in a capital state of preservation, consisted of small trunks of elm 7½ to 8 feet long, hollowed out to about 10 inches diameter and tapered at one end to fit one into the other, and are supposed to have formed the earlier method of supplying London with spring water from the adjacent villages where reservoirs were situated, Sadler's Wells, Bagnigge Wells, and others out further, as these wooden tubes have been found in recent excavations from Whitechapel church as far as Romford. That the supply was for London there can hardly be any doubt, and this is testified by the fluted or pointed ends of the trunks being inserted towards the city. The logs, which were evidently laid in the ground no more labour being expended on them than the boring and tapering, have been roughly drilled out, and afterwards charred, and probably at no period in its history was the water purer than when filtered through these rough pipes. The period when these somewhat crude appliances were laid down, it is reasonable to conclude, was anterior to Sir Hugh Myddleton's scheme to Riverhead, the outgrowth of the inadequate supply of water of London at that period. It is a matter of history that the water was first brought from the outlying district of Hertfordshire by wooden troughs to the New River, and may be some connection with the pipes recently discovered. All along the gutter-way of Old Street, on the north side, about 18 inches below the surface, and it would be interesting to trace its course. The earthy moisture is the best preservative of elm to resist the elements of decay at work, and its durability to a further test. Whether they were laid down by Sir Hugh Myddleton they stood the test of time well, not a sign of decay being noticeable or prior to that, they have in those recently brought to light.
