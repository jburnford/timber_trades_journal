Neil & Son, coachbuilders, 318, Paisley Road, Glasgow, was examined in bankruptcy.\nBankrupt stated that he first commenced business about 35 years ago in Kent Road, with £60.\nHe subsequently went to Partick and carried on business.\nHe did pretty well there, but lost £700 in building.\nThis was about 23 years ago, and necessitated his taking out sequestration.\nHe got his discharge on that occasion, and commenced business again in Paisley Road.\nHe did well there, too, but three years ago the place was partially burned, and he lost the season's work.\nThe insurance company gave him £500 over and above the price of the salvage, which he paid too much for.\nThat was the beginning of his present difficulties.\nAbout nine years ago he failed a second time, when he again got his discharge.\nHe started building a property in Helensburg, but it was not finished yet.\nTo enable him to do this, he borrowed £1,800 from Govanhill District Permanent Economic Building Society—£1,500 on permanent loan, and £300 on temporary loan.\nPart of that had been repaid.\nHis state of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £726 14s., and a deficiency of £293 7s. 3d.\nThe examination was adjourned.\n\nJames Williamson and Hugh Williamson, as partners of the firm of David Williamson & Sons, joiners, Campbeltown, and Thornhill, Dumfriesshire, are to be examined in the Sheriff Court House on Tuesday next, at 11 a.m.\n\nA meeting of the creditors of James Young & Sons (Limited), railway contractors, was held in the company's offices at Edinburgh on Friday last, to consult with the directors and a committee, regarding the complications caused by the sequestration of the late firm of James Young & Sons.\nThe meeting was private, but we understand the creditors that the debentures to deal with any pressing claims.\nThis will probably be done.\n\nLEITH.—Altogether some 13,370 tons of wood were imported into Leith last month as against 14,122 tons imported in July, 1898.\n\nThe Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company have placed an order with R. Y. Pickering & Co. (Limited), of Wishaw, for 450 steel-frame waggons to carry 12 tons of iron ore each.\nThere are two noteworthy features connected with this contract.\nIn the first place, it is a step in advance, inasmuch as the maximum load of mineral waggons on four wheels has up to the present, at all events in Scotland, been from 8 to 10 tons.\nWhilst this new type of G. and W. waggon will carry 12 tons of ore, it can also be used to carry 12 tons of coal, as its dimensions and form of construction will not interfere with the existing height of colliery \"screens\" and shipping appliances.\nThe other feature is that the entire waggon excepting the sides and bottom, is to be of steel and iron.\nThe practice hitherto, with few exceptions, to build all Scotch railway company's farme waggons.",
