The \"Concordia,\" from Quebec, is discharging 600 standards spruce deals and battens, consigned principally to Allison.\nAlthough there is little change to report in business this week, sales are being made to a satisfactory amount, and prices continue very firm. From Baltimore, per \"Orthia,\" there are some important parcels of hard-woods to various consignees, which include oak logs and planks, whitewood logs and boards, &c. These have already been made and there is every probability of a good demand during the next few weeks. A demand exists for most hard-woods, and prime lots of nearly all kinds are in good request.\nThe cargo of mahogany per \"Emily A. Laguna,\" referred to last week, is now practically discharged, and bears out the description given then of the portion landed, being well straight, fresh, and of good manufacture. The wood is intended to be brought to public sale at an early date, probably the 12th September, by Calder, Henderson & Livingston.\nShipbuilding returns for August show 37.800 tons as having been launched in the Clyde, as compared with 29.800 tons same month a year ago.\nIt is gratifying to note that the orders for new ships have been larger during August than for several previous months, and amount to 43.000 tons.\n\nLEITH.\nThere are still liberal arrivals of wood to report for the past week, particulars of which are given elsewhere, but special reference may be made to a cargo of deals and battens, per \"Twilight,\" ss from Kotka, and a cargo of battens, per \"Nivingston,\" ss from Hernosand, both for Park Dobson & Co. There is also a steamer shipment of waney board pine logs and deals, also elm logs, per \"Jacona,\" ss from Montreal, deserving of notice, divided between several receivers. Altogether the docks have been particularly busy, and although the bulk of the arrivals is being stored, a fair proportion is going direct into consumption, which is a satisfactory feature in the trade.\nA public sale was held on Tuesday 29th inst., by D. W. Beattie, at the Edinburgh Dock. There was only a moderate attendance, and business done was proportionately restricted. For what was sold fair prices were got, the exposer holding firmly for some advance on recent rates, and the improvement may now be said to be fairly established in this district.\n\nWRIGHT, GRAHAM & CO.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n7, Royal Bank Place,\nBuchanan Street, GLASGOW,\nTelegraphic Address—\"BRAKRIDGE.\"\nTelephone No. 1153.\n\nCANT & KEMP,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n52, ST.
