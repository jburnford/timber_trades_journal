OBITUARY.
J. P. McPHUN.
The trade will learn with regret the death of Mr. McPhun, of the firm of J. P. McPhun & Co., timber merchants, Bridgeton, which occurred at Glasgow on the 22nd inst. Mr. McPhun had not been able to attend to business, although he had been at his office some time since, his health had not been satisfactory, and a few days ago he underwent an operation, when it was hoped would have had a successful result. Mr. McPhun was a Justice of the Peace and took an active interest in the municipal affairs of the city, having been in the Council since 1890, and for three years held office as a city magistrate. The deceased gentleman originated the business of saw-millers to which he and timber merchants fully 20 years ago, and developed it extensively, and of late years carried on a large amount of work as a builder and joiner at Springbank, Garscube Road. Mr. McPhun was only about 50 years of age, a widower, his wife having predeceased him not long ago, and is survived by three daughters and one son, Mr. Robert McPhun, who has been taking an active part in the firm's affairs for several years, will now carry on the business, which owes its eminence to the efforts of the deceased.
