FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BRADING, THOS., builder, Ventnor, Isle of Wight.
Debtor, at his public examination, at the Court House, Newport, made a proposition of 7s. 6d. in the £1.
The examination was adjourned for a fortnight, to enable him to prepare a cash account and file a deficiency account, and in order that the scheme proposed by debtor might be submitted to his creditors.
MARRABLE, RICHARD JOHN CLINCH, builder, Trinidad, Alma Grove, Bromley, Kent.
-The statutory meeting of the creditors interested herein took place at the offices of the Official Receiver, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E., on last week, under the presidency of Mr. Acheson, Assistant Official Receiver.
The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £554 14s. 10d., of which £231 was expected to rank for dividend.
The deficiency was returned at £231 9s. 2d.
The debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through "loss through tak-ing contracts at too low a price, and loss on speculative building."
The meeting was of a formal nature, and the debtor having no offer of composition to submit, it was decided to leave the matter in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration in the usual manner.
MARTIN, JAMES, builder, 1, Cropping Park Terrace, Mutley, Plymouth.
The first meeting of the creditors herein was held at the offices of the O.R., Plymouth, on Friday.
The statement of affairs filed, disclosed gross liabili-ties £5,645 to creditors partly se-cured, £536 17s. 10d., a defici-ency of £405 7s. 4d.
The debtor alleges as the cause of failure-Want of capital, pressure by creditors, and failure to obtain further loans on property, and betting.
Resolutions were carried adjudicating the debtor bankrupt, ap-pointing Mr. W. Luxon, Plymouth, chartered accountant, as trustee, and a committee of in-spection.
The following are timber merchants among the creditors :-
... ... ... £ s. d.
Fox, Eliott & Co., Plymouth ... 180 3 6

Mr. John Bos-worth was partner with the bankrupt from January, 1890, to October, 1896.
Since the dissolution of the partnership, bankrupt stated that he found he paid more than he ought to have done.

At Nottingham on Friday last the first meeting was held of the creditors under this affair.
After considerable discussion a committee of in-spection was appointed, and Mr Barton, secretary of the Nottingham Builders' Associa-tion, appointed trustee.
To them was left the question of the debtor's contract for the erection of Kirby-in-Ashfield Board Schools.
WILLIAMS, FK. WALTER, builder, Lither-land.
This debtor not being able to explain his deficiency in a proper manner at the Liver-pool Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week, the case was adjourned to the 28th inst in order that debtor should be allowed an opportunity of accounting for £100 of deficiency unexplained.
WOOD, WM., builder, 45, Peterboro Road, Fulham, S.W.
The bankrupt attended for his public examination on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Hope, his accounts showing unsecured debts £748 15s. 1d., and debts fully secured £2,270, against assets £630 3s.
He stated that having prior to July, 1898, car-ried on business as a land agent and surveyor, he, about that date, with a capital of £600, commenced to build twelve houses at Uxbridge Road, Hanwell, being financed in his operations by a firm of solicitors.
At Christmas last, owing to the increased cost of labour and materials, he was compelled to cease buildings, and the mortgagees took pos-session of the property, which, although in an unfinished state, the debtor estimated would realise a surplus of £430 over charges thereon.
He further stated that in July, 1898, he commenced to build three houses, which are not yet finished, at Grange Road, Leyton.
In January, 1899, he lost about £117 on a building contract undertaken by him, but not completed at Castle Hill, Ealing.
He attri-butes his insolvency to losses on his building speculations.
The examination was concluded.
VINES, JOHN, and VINES, FRANK, cabinet makers, 413 Coventry Road, Birmingham, and Henshaw Road, Small Heath, Birmingham.
John Vines stated on Wednesday last week at the Birmingham Bankruptcy Court that between January and July his losses had been over £400, and at the time of the receiving order had increased to £859.
The accounts showed that he had sold some of the goods at a loss.
They continued trading, and made purchases in the hope that trade would improve.
The Registrar remarked that the accounts showed that the more trade they did the more money the father and son lost, so that they ought to have been desperately busy before they failed for the amount given.
The examination was concluded.
