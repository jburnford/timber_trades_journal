The action was at the instance of the\nwidow of John Simpson, a night watchman,\nwho resided at 5, Bishop Street, Port Dundas,\nand the defenders were James Graham & Co.,\nwrights and timber merchants, 95 George\nStreet, Glasgow. Pursuer claimed £151 16s.\nin compensation for the death of her husband.\nJohn Simpson, who was killed by slipping\nfrom a plank used as a gangway at a building\nin course of demolition at 144, George\nStreet. Deceased fell a distance of 14 feet,\nand his neck was broken by the fall, which,\nit is averred, was the result of a temporary\nfaintness. Pursuer was wholly dependent\nupon deceased for her support, and there were\ntwo imbecile daughters.\nThe Sheriff finds for pursuer, and awards\n£91—£100 to the applicant, and £41 to the\nimbecile daughter who lived at home, the\nother daughter having for some time been in\nan asylum.\nIn a note, his Lordship says it is pleaded by\nthe respondents that the death of the deceased\ndid not arise out of, or in the course of, his\nemployment, as he was then crossing the plank\nto go to the back part of the premises for the\npurpose of having his tea. His Lordship held\nthat even in such circumstances deceased did\nnot cease to be a watchman by taking his tea\nat the back of the building any more than\nwhen he smoked at the front. As deceased\nwas not allowed to leave the premises, taking\nhis tea there was necessarily connected with\nhis employment.—\"Citizen,\" Aug. 29th.\n\nTHE BUILDING AND TIMBER TRADES.\nBANKRUPTCY STATISTICS FOR 1898.\nFrom the report of the Inspector-General in\nBankruptcy we find that with regard to the\nbuilding trades there were 774 failures in 1894,\nwith liabilities amounting to £659,465. In\n1895, there were 595 failures with liabilities\namounting to £531,880. In 1896 there were 629\nfailures with liabilities amounting £491,039. In\n1897, there were 612 failures with liabilities\namounting to £488,416, and in 1898, there were\n643 failures with liabilities amounting to\n£508,915. It will be seen that in 1898 there\nwas an increase of 31 in the number of failures\nand a total decrease in the amount of liabilities\nof £19,501. With respect to timber merchants,\nthere were 58 failures in 1894 with liabilities\namounting to £264,780. In 1895, there were 29\nfailures with liabilities amounting to £146,065 ;\nin 1896, 22 failures, with liabilities amounting\nto £229,195 ; in 1897, 25 failures with liabilities\namounting to £67,324, and in 1898, there were\n31 failures with liabilities amounting to\n£118,580, from which it will be seen that as\ncompared with 1897, that there was an increase\nin 1898 in the number of failures by 6, and an\nincrease in the amount of the liabilities of\n£51,256.\n\nWE regret to hear that Mr. Jas. Graham,\njun., eldest son of Mr. Jas. Graham, cabinet\nmaker, of Wishaw, died on Tuesday.\n\nMiller & Inglis, builders of 175, Saint Vin-\ncent Street, Glasgow, and Fulton Street, Crow\nRoad, Partick, are to be examined in Sheriff\nBoyd's Chambers, County Buildings, Glasgow,\non the 15th inst., at ten o'clock.\n\nGLASGOW BRIDGES CONTRACTS.—At a meet-\ning of the Bridges Committee of Glasgow\nCorporation recently, it was decided to ac-\ncept the offer of Messrs. Kennedy, Partick, to\nerect the two new bridges over the Clyde at\nGovan and Polmadie. The offer is for\n£77,000, the material of the temporary Jamaica\nStreet Bridge to be utilised, and the work to\nbe completed before March next.\n\nGREENHEART,\nMACLEAN, TODD, & CO.,\nGREENOCK.\nTelegraphic Address,—\"GREENHEART.\"",
