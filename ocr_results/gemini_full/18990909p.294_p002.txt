INTERESTING WORKMAN'S COMPENSATION CLAIM.
A SEQUEL TO A WATCHMAN'S DEATH
Sheriff Strachan has issued an interlocutor
in a case under the Workmen's Compensation
Act. The action was at the instance of the
widow of John Simpson, a night watchman,
who resided at 5, Bishop Street, Port Dundas,
and the defenders were James Graham & Co.,
wrights and timber merchants, 95 George
Street, Glasgow. Pursuer claimed £151 16s.
in compensation for the death of her husband.
John Simpson, who was killed by slipping
from a plank used as a gangway at a building
in course of demolition at 144, George
Street. Deceased fell a distance of 14 feet,
and his neck was broken by the fall, which,
it is averred, was the result of a temporary
faintness. Pursuer was wholly dependent
upon deceased for her support, and there were
two imbecile daughters.
The Sheriff finds for pursuer, and awards
£91—£100 to the applicant, and £41 to the
imbecile daughter who lived at home, the
other daughter having for some time been in
an asylum.
In a note, his Lordship says it is pleaded by
the respondents that the death of the deceased
did not arise out of, or in the course of, his
employment, as he was then crossing the plank
to go to the back part of the premises for the
purpose of having his tea. His Lordship held
that even in such circumstances deceased did
not cease to be a watchman by taking his tea
at the back of the building any more than
when he smoked at the front. As deceased
was not allowed to leave the premises, taking
his tea there was necessarily connected with
his employment.—"Citizen," Aug. 29th.

THE BUILDING AND TIMBER TRADES.
BANKRUPTCY STATISTICS FOR 1898.
From the report of the Inspector-General in
Bankruptcy we find that with regard to the
building trades there were 774 failures in 1894,
with liabilities amounting to £659,465. In
1895, there were 595 failures with liabilities
amounting to £531,880. In 1896 there were 629
failures with liabilities amounting £491,039. In
1897, there were 612 failures with liabilities
amounting to £488,416, and in 1898, there were
643 failures with liabilities amounting to
£508,915. It will be seen that in 1898 there
was an increase of 31 in the number of failures
and a total decrease in the amount of liabilities
of £19,501. With respect to timber merchants,
there were 58 failures in 1894 with liabilities
amounting to £264,780. In 1895, there were 29
failures with liabilities amounting to £146,065 ;
in 1896, 22 failures, with liabilities amounting
to £229,195 ; in 1897, 25 failures with liabilities
amounting to £67,324, and in 1898, there were
31 failures with liabilities amounting to
£118,580, from which it will be seen that as
compared with 1897, that there was an increase
in 1898 in the number of failures by 6, and an
increase in the amount of the liabilities of
£51,256.

WE regret to hear that Mr. Jas. Graham,
jun., eldest son of Mr. Jas. Graham, cabinet
