[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

JOBBINS, CHARLES, builder, Lee-on-the-Solent, Hants. The statement of affairs filed herein discloses gross liabilities £7,163 4s. 7d., of which £2,331 1s 1d. is expected to rank for dividend and assets £1,424 11s. 2d., deficiency £906 9s. 11d. Debtor does not admit that he is insolvent; his difficulties have arisen in consequence (1) of his having locked up more than his capital in buildings at Lee ; (2) difficulty in obtaining labour and increased wages during the last year ; (3) losses on contracts ; (4) domestic affliction ; (5) his credit having been hampered in consequence of slanderous reports since November last. He recovered damages in an action for slander, but this did not remedy the mischief caused. The following timber trade merchants are among the creditors :—

LAWRENCE, THOMAS, builder, Kerry Cottage, Horsforth.—Upon this case being called at the Leeds Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday last, the Official Receiver said the debtor was dead, and the Registrar accordingly made a note of the fact on the file of the proceedings. It appeared that debtor was killed at the midland extension works, Apperley Bridge. The statement of affairs showed a deficiency of £1,140 13s. 8d. Debtor alleged his failure to have been caused through his commencing the erection of 22 houses with insufficient capital, and to law costs.

LILLIE, A. E. (LTD.), timber and builders' merchants, Landport, Portsmouth. The winding-up order against this company was made on August 9th upon the petition of creditors, and the statutory meetings of the creditors and the shareholders were held on Friday, the 19th ult., at the Board of Trade offices, Lincoln's Inn, before Mr. G. S. Barnes, Senior Official Receiver. Mr. J. E. Blogg attended on behalf of Mr. Lillie, Mr. Boxall and other solicitors represented creditors, and Mr. McKay appeared on behalf of Palfreman, Foster & Co., debenture holders. After dealing with the various proofs, the Chairman said that the case afforded an illustration of the uses, or, rather, the abuses, to which the Companies Acts might be put. It appeared that the company was registered on October 29th, 1897, with a nominal capital of £20,000, in £1 shares, to purchase the business of a timber and builders' merchant, belonging to Mr. A. E. Lillie, who took over the business in 1879, and carried it on alone until the registration of the company. In 1897 Palfreman, Foster & Co., who were at that time unsecured creditors for about £18,000, suggested the formation of a company, the sole and avowed object being to provide debentures for the amount due to them. Had then been opened on their account, which seemed some five years. Mr. Lillie stated that he was in a position that he offered all the security he was in a position to provide personally but this was refused. The operation of the Bills of Sale Act would have been an impediment to effectively charging the stock, which was avoidable by an issue of debentures. The company was accordingly promoted by Palfreman, Foster & Co., who paid one-half of the promotion expenses, "one man company," and this was such a company, if ever there was one; for it appeared that Mr. Lillie should have, as far as possible, the same powers and privileges in regard to the business as he possessed before the formation of the company, and by the articles of association he was appointed governing director for life, with power to appoint and remove other directors. The Official Receiver said that by an agreement dated December 29th, 1897, Mr. Lillie sold to the company the goodwill of his business, with certain freehold and leasehold properties, plant, machinery, book debts, &c., and the benefit of all contracts, for the sum of £15,000 (in fully paid shares), and the payment by the company of all debts and liabilities of the business. No annual or other balance sheets had previously been prepared but a statement of affairs was made out as at November 1st, 1897, showing liabilities amounting to £25,980 9s. 10d. The assets were valued at £35,687 16s. 8d. and the purchase price, therefore, included for goodwill of £6,292, which amount by subsequent adjustment in the account was increased to £6,036 4s. 4d. The valuation of the stock of timber was made by Mr. E. C. Hall. On December 31st, 1897, an agreement was entered into between the company and Palfreman, Foster & Co. providing that debentures should be issued to them as security for a debt then due, or accruing due, for £18,754, and for further advances. It further provided that they should continue to deal with and supply goods to the company, and give financial aid in the same manner as with Mr. Lillie before the incorporation, and that when Palfreman, Foster & Co. desired to cease business with the company they should give six months' notice of their intention. The Official Receiver had been unable to ascertain that any such notice was given. A very serious question might arise whether, under the terms of the agreement, Palfreman, Foster & Co. did not constitute themselves partners in the business. This was a matter on which the creditors would do well to be advised. It further appeared that on January 12th, 1898, Mr. T. E. Jenkins, to appointed his son, Mr. E. C. Hall, a director, and on or about August 2nd, 1898, he also appointed Mr. E. C. Hall, a representative of Palfreman, Foster & Co., to be a director. Mr. Lillie constituted some 13 meetings by himself, his personal presence only. He appeared to have sealed all deeds and documents, and to have signed all cheques for the company. The full control that Mr. Lillie was intended to have was shown by the following extracts from the articles of association:— "Article 28.—The said A. E. Lillie shall be the governing director of the company, and shall have authority to exercise all the powers, authorities, and discretions by these presents expressed to be vested in the directors generally, and all the other directors, if any, for the time being, of the company, shall be under his control, and shall be bound to conform to his directions in regard to the company's business. Article 32.—Mr. Lillie may from time to time, and at any time by writing under his hand, appoint any other persons to be directors of the company, and may define, limit, and restrict their powers, and may fix and determine their remuneration and duties, and may at any time in like manner remove any director howsoever appointed, and may at any time convene a general meeting of the company." Article 32.—"No resolution of a general meeting or of the board of directors shall be valid if the said A. E. Lillie dissents therefrom in writing." The Chairman further reported that on January 2nd, 1899, 15,000 fully paid shares were allotted to Mr. Lillie, the only other shares issued being seven to the signatories of the memorandum and articles of association, including Mr. Lillie, and five

shares to Mr. E. C. Hall. On January 1898, debentures amounting to £5,000 were issued to Palfreman, Foster & Co., and on July 5th, 1898, a further issue of debentures was created in favour of Mrs. K. E. H. Lillie, in consideration of cash advanced. On August 2nd, 1898, debentures were issued to the Capital and Counties Bank for £2,000 to secure an overdraft. On January 2nd, 1899, a receiver (Mr. Bayne) was appointed at the instance of Palfreman, Foster & Co., and on the following day he took possession of the property of the company. The appointment of a receiver by the debenture-holders was attributed by Mr. Lillie to the fact that he was also due to the locking up of the assets of the company in property not readily realisable. No attempt seemed to have been made by Mr. Hall to interfere with or exercise control over the business of the company. With reference to the accounts, a statement of affairs had been filed by Mr. Lillie, showing unsecured liabilities, £6,183 17s. 1d.; debts fully secured, £17,600. The assets were debenture bonds, £25,983 5s. 3d.; cash in hand and at bank, £104 1s. 1d.; bills receivable, £945 9s. 6d.; stock-in-trade, estimated to realise £10,311 4s. 10d.; machinery, plant, trade fixtures, fittings, &c., £2,000; other property (mills, sheds, &c.), £3,000; debts (good), £3,784 14s. 6d.; doubtful, £1,000; bad (£465 4s. 7d.), estimated to produce nil; bills of exchange, £47 4s. 11d.; estimated surplus from securities in hands of creditors fully secured, £12,419 5s. 3d.; making a total of £32,049 6s. 5d., subject to the deduction of £17,600 in respect of loans on debenture bonds, leaving estimated net assets, £14,449 6s. 5d.; thus showing a surplus of £7,809 19s. 4d., subject to the costs of liquidation. Mr. Lillie concurred in the statement except as regarded the assets, which he valued at £35,687 16s. 8d., a total of £8,740 less than those shown by Mr. Lillie. It remained to be seen what they would realise, and whether there would be any surplus available for the unsecured creditors after payment of the debenture-holders and the regarded contributories, a deficiency of £18,754 was disclosed. Replying to a question, the Official Receiver said that no valuation of the assets was made by his department, as they could only accept the figures given in the statement of affairs.—In the discussion which followed, Mr. Boxall raised the question whether Palfreman, Foster & Co. entered into an agreement requiring them, when called upon, to took to give financial aid to the company, and if they desired to do so.—Mr. McKay said that this was not the time for testing the validity of the debentures held by Palfreman, Foster & Co. They would be prepared to contest the security at the proper time. He wished entirely to dissent from the Official Receiver's statement as to Palfreman, Foster & Co., having assisted in the promotion of the company, or, at least, in any objectionable sense of the term promotion. The statement put forward by Mr. Lillie, were, he submitted, to be accepted with a grain of salt. Palfreman, Foster & Co. were well known in the timber trade, and it was their desire to do all that lay in their power in the interests of all concerned. He was also satisfied that Mr. Bayne, the receiver, do what he could for the benefit of the creditors.—The Chairman: But Palfreman, Foster & Co. did not promote the company, how did it happen that they took one-half of the promotion money?—Mr. McKay said that they did not promote the company in the sense usually meant in the objectionable term. What they paid was for registration expenses.—The Official Receiver: Would you prefer my stating that you assisted in the formation of the company?—Mr. McKay said that he was not prepared to make any admission on the point, but it must be understood that he acquiesced in the statements which were made affecting Palfreman, Foster & Co.—The Official Receiver did not use the word in the sense of assisting to do an illegal act. Mr. Boxall said that a statement was made by directors and certain members of the Lillie family were withdrawn, but he believed that a much larger indebtedness to the company would remain, and he ventured to hope that a firm of such standing as Palfreman, Foster & Co might liquidate that amount, and thus end to the whole matter. Perhaps it would be advisable to take this into consideration, with the result the creditors unanimously resolved that the Official Receiver should be requested to act as liquidator under the petition, and that they also appointed the following as a committee of inspection:—Mr. C. D. Arundel; Mr. W. C. De Boinville (Bournes & Co.), Russia Wharf,
