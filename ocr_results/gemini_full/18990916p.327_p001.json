A steady consumption of wood prevails, and merchants are holding firmly for the advance in prices recently made, which is being generally conceded in the ordinary retail trade. Prospects for the remainder of the season are good, and a fairly active trade is anticipated.\nGarland & Roger, Ltd., held a public sale at their Railway Yard on Tuesday, 12 inst. There was not a large attendance, and the tendency seems towards a diminishing outlet by means of auction sales. Buyers are so continually waited upon by travellers, and their requirements supplied as they arise, that the inducement to attend public sales is very much lessened from even a decade ago. For what was sold on Tuesday fair prices were got, but, as already indicated, there was not a large turnover, although there was evidence that more might have been sold had some concession in prices been made.\nA serious fire occurred in the Albert Dock on the morning of the 8th inst., resulting in the complete destruction of No. 5 Transit Shed and the greater part of its contents, consisting of baled straw, onions, rice, and 150 large casks of spirits, along with a valuable hydraulic crane and elevator. For a time there was some fear of the steamer \"Amsterdam,\" which was berthed alongside the shed, but she was timeously removed into the middle of the dock. A number of railway waggons were attacked by the flames, three being destroyed and several more damaged. Some battens which also had just been discharged, ex (ss) \"Reval,\" from Cronstadt, and piled alongside the shed, were partially destroyed. It is estimated that the total loss may run up to nearly £10,000, which, however, is all covered by insurance.\n\n327\nTelephone No. 1875 Telegraphic Address:- 'KATRI, GLASGOW.'\nLtd.,\nWINDSOR SAW MILLS, 10-12, CAMPBELL STREET, GOVAN\nWalnut, Burr and Knife Cut Veneers, Yellow Pine and Spruce Deals, Floorings, Linings and Battens, Mouldings in all woods.\n\npcs. battens 30 pcs. 40 lds. spars-Fleming and Harry Ltd. 263 lds battens-S C.
