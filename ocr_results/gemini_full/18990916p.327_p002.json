Stephenson, J.P., timber merchant, of Samuelston, Loanhead, Haddington.\nThe deceased gentleman was in his 76th year, and died of paralysis.\nHe was engaged in the home wood trade, but was also a farmer and landed proprietor.\nHe was unmarried, highly respected, a member of the School Board, took an active part in politics, being a liberal, and a conspicuous figure from point of personal appearance.\nHis remains were buried at Gladsmuir on Monday last.\n\n—:o:—\n\nSUDDEN DEATH OF A GREENOCK JOINER.\nThe trade in Greenock and district will learn with deep regret of the death of Mr. John Boyd, joiner and builder, which took place with startling suddenness at his residence, 29, Brougham Street, at a late hour on Friday, Up to 8th inst. the latest he had been actively engaged at his usual avocations, and the news of his demise has come as a great shock to his friends.\nThe day previous he presided at the opening of the Royal West of Renfrewshire Horticultural Society, in Greenock Town Hall, and as president of the society he also presided at the annual dinner the same afternoon.\nThe keen interest he took in the affairs of this body is evidenced by the fact that he occupied himself till nearly eleven o'clock on Friday night in superintending the closing of the exhibition.\nDuring the day, however, he had complained of a pain in the region of the heart, and by the advice of Dr. Black, whom he had consulted, he was cautioned against over-exciting himself.\nHe returned home from the Town Hall about eleven o'clock, and sat down on a chair by the side of his wife and family.\nShortly afterwards he was seized with a sudden illness, and fell forward.\nMrs. Boyd at once sent for Drs. Black and Cook, but their services were of no avail, death having resulted almost immediately.\nAs a joiner and builder, Mr. Boyd was well known in Greenock and district, and had carried out many important contracts.\nHe was the contractor for the joiner work of the new buildings now being erected at Cathcart Square for the Clydesdale Bank.\nIt may be recalled also that he erected the old circus at the foot of Campbell Street for Mr. John Henry Cooke.\nHe was a member of the West Parish Church, in the affairs of which he took a warm interest.\nOf a quiet and kindly disposition, Mr. Boyd was held in much esteem by all with whom he came into contact.\nDeceased was sixty years of age, and has left a widow and ten of a family.\nThe funeral took place at Greenock Cemetery on Tuesday, and was largely attended.\n\nFIRE AT YORKHILL TIMBER YARD, GLASGOW.\nThere has been until now a remarkable immunity of fires in the public storage yards in Glasgow, and any that occurred having been comparatively trifling.\nOn Sunday, the 10th inst., a fire was discovered about two o'clock in the afternoon, which unfortunately was not seen until it had a considerable hold.\nFire brigades from all stations in the city were soon on the spot, and the yard being near the river, five steam engines pumped water from the Clyde, and a good supply was also got from the mains in the adjacent roads.\nThe efforts of the firemen were successful, but not until about 800 standards of wood stored there had been destroyed.\nAs nearly as can be at present estimated the loss is about £7,000, the greater part, about 500 standards, being spruce deals.\nThe storage yard belongs to the Clyde Trust, and is used by importers for deals and other sawn wood arriving by ships, and as the wood often remains there for a time after being sold to merchants and consumers, the list of those who are affected by the fire is a considerable one.\nAmongst those are Messrs. Allison, Cousland & Co., Calder, Henderson & Livingston, Cant & Kemp, Edmiston & Mitchells, F. A. Lightbody & Co., McDowall & Neilson, Robt. Sheriff, Singleton, Dunn & Co., Wright, Graham & Co., Buchanan & French, Brownlee & Co., Ltd., Fraser, Taylor & Gibson, J. Herbert-son & Son, Wm. Shanks & Son, J. Scott, and Wylie, Stewart & Marshall.\n\n—:o:—\n\nTHE SCOTCH BUILDING TRADE.\nThe new town hall at Jedburgh is to cost £5,600.\nIt has been proposed that £4,000 of the amount should be borrowed and the balance raised by bazaars, etc.\nThe new fever hospital at Stirling is expected to cost £7,000.\nA Glasgow building, 25, New Wynd, in course of demolition, on Tuesday suddenly collapsed, injuring four men.\nThe master joiners of Dumfermline have this week conceded their employès a rise of wages to the extent of ½d. per hour.\nThe standard wage is now 8½d. an hour.\n\n—:o:—\n\nWORKMEN'S COMPENSATION CASE.\nAt the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, on 8th September, Andrew Milne sued Mr. Archibald M'Kelvie, Granton, under the Workmen's Compensation Act in respect of an accident which befel him on the 21st June last while engaged unloading battens in Granton Harbour.\nThe Sheriff found that plaintiff was not employed in or about a \"factory\" in the sense of the Act, and he dismissed the petition, allowing expenses to neither party.\nIn a note the Sheriff stated that it was not conclusive against the petitioner that the accident happened on board a ship.\nIf it had happened through the breakdown of the shore crane the case would, he said, have been within the Act.\n\n—:o:—\n\nTHE TRADE OF THE CLYDE.—At the monthly meeting of the Clyde Trustees held at Glasgow, Mr. Gray, the convener of the Finance Committee, in making a statement with reference to the accounts of the trust for the year ending June 30th last, said that regarding tonnage dues on vessels, it would be found that they had increased by £10,000.\nRents from timber-yards showed an increase of about £2,000, which was the result of greater accommodation having been provided.\nThe same remark applied to the graving dock accommodation, the rents from which had increased from £13,000 to £21,000 in two years.\n\nCAMERON BROTHERS\nTIMBER IMPORTERS AND SAW-MILLERS,\nPERTH SAW-MILLS, PERTH.\nBRANCH YARD AT NEWBURGH.\nTELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS—\"BROTHERS, PERTH.\"\n\nGAZETTE.\nThe following circular has been issued by the secretary of James Young & Sons (Ltd.):— \"With reference to my circular of 19th ult., I am desired by the directors and by the committee representing the creditors to request your attendance at a meeting of the company's creditors, to be held within Dowell's Rooms, George Street, Edinburgh, upon Friday, the 15th inst., at three o'clock, when the committee will submit a report upon the affairs of the company, with recommendations as to the course to be adopted.\nIn the meantime I am instructed to state that it is the unanimous opinion of the committee that it is eminently desirable that the company should remain in a position permitting negotiations for the realisation of the plant and other assets to the greatest advantage.\nThe committee would therefore impress upon all creditors the expediency of their continuing to refrain from action against the company.—(Signed) JOHN FORREST, interim secretary.\"\n\nDOCK STRIKE AT GRANGEMOUTH.—About 200 dock labourers have struck work at Grangemouth for an advance of 2d. per hour.\nThe shipping is consequently detained.\nSeveral large steamers, with cargoes of wood, have just arrived.\nThe men are determined to hold out.\n\nSAW MILL FATALITY.—On Tuesday night, Joseph Walker, labourer, aged 70, died in the Royal Infirmary, Aberdeen, from the effects of injuries received while at work in the woodyard of Messrs. John Fleming & Co., Albert Sawmills, early in the day.\nWalker had been working on an overhead crane, when he lost his balance and fell to the ground, a distance of 14 feet.\nHe sustained a scalp wound, and several of his ribs were also broken.\n\nTo Fit the Waistcoat Pocket.\nIn Limp Cloth, 3in. x 4in. for the Waistcoat Pocket, Price Sixpence.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL\nPOCKET CALCULATOR\nAll sizes, from 4-in. x 3-in. to 4-in. x 12-in.; also number of running feet in standard.\nPrice per lineal ft.\n\" standard\n\" cube\n\" ton, 66ft.\nLoad and Standard of all sizes running feet to Cube.\nRunning feet to Cube, Standard, and Load.\nPrice per Standard £4 10s. to £19 10s.\nPrice per standard and per yard of Flooring.\nComparative price per Ton.\nComparison per ton, per cube, and per lineal foot.\nComparative price per Railway carriage load.\nWILLIAM RIDER & SON, LIMITED\nTimber Trades Journal Office,\n164, ALDERSGATE STREET, LONDON, E.C.\n\nESTABLISHED 1853.\nM. & J.
