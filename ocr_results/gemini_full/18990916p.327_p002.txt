OBITUARY.
WM. STEPHENSON, J.P.
We regret to announce the death, which took place on the 8th inst., of Wm. Stephenson, J.P., timber merchant, of Samuelston, Loanhead, Haddington.
The deceased gentleman was in his 76th year, and died of paralysis.
He was engaged in the home wood trade, but was also a farmer and landed proprietor.
He was unmarried, highly respected, a member of the School Board, took an active part in politics, being a liberal, and a conspicuous figure from point of personal appearance.
His remains were buried at Gladsmuir on Monday last.

SUDDEN DEATH OF A GREENOCK JOINER.
The trade in Greenock and district will learn with deep regret of the death of Mr. John Boyd, joiner and builder, which took place with startling suddenness at his residence, 29, Brougham Street, at a late hour on Friday, Up to 8th inst. the latest he had been actively engaged at his usual avocations, and the news of his demise has come as a great shock to his friends.
The day previous he presided at the opening of the Royal West of Renfrewshire Horticultural Society, in Greenock Town Hall, and as president of the society he also presided at the annual dinner the same afternoon.
The keen interest he took in the affairs of this body is evidenced by the fact that he occupied himself till nearly eleven o'clock on Friday night in superintending the closing of the exhibition.
During the day, however, he had complained of a pain in the region of the heart, and by the advice of Dr. Black, whom he had consulted, he was cautioned against over-exciting himself.
He returned home from the Town Hall about eleven o'clock, and sat down on a chair by the side of his wife and family.
Shortly afterwards he was seized with a sudden illness, and fell forward.
Mrs. Boyd at once sent for Drs. Black and Cook, but their services were of no avail, death having resulted almost immediately.
As a joiner and builder, Mr. Boyd was well known in Greenock and district, and had carried out many important contracts.
He was the contractor for the joiner work of the new buildings now being erected at Cathcart Square for the Clydesdale Bank.
It may be recalled also that he erected the old circus at the foot of Campbell Street for Mr. John Henry Cooke.
He was a member of the West Parish Church, in the affairs of which he took a warm interest.
Of a quiet and kindly disposition, Mr. Boyd was held in much esteem by all with whom he came into contact.
Deceased was sixty years of age, and has left a widow and ten of a family.
The funeral took place at Greenock Cemetery on Tuesday, and was largely attended.

FIRE AT YORKHILL TIMBER YARD, GLASGOW.
There has been until now a remarkable immunity of fires in the public storage yards in Glasgow, and any that occurred having been comparatively trifling.
On Sunday, the 10th inst., a fire was discovered about two o'clock in the afternoon, which unfortunately was not seen until it had a considerable hold.
Fire brigades from all stations in the city were soon on the spot, and the yard being near the river, five steam engines pumped water from the Clyde, and a good supply was also got from the mains in the adjacent roads.
The efforts of the firemen were successful, but not until about 800 standards of wood stored there had been destroyed.
As nearly as can be at present estimated the loss is about £7,000, the greater part, about 500 standards, being spruce deals.
The storage yard belongs to the Clyde Trust, and is used by importers for deals and other sawn wood arriving by ships, and as the wood often remains there for a time after being sold to merchants and consumers, the list of those who are affected by the fire is a considerable one.
Amongst those are Messrs. Allison, Cousland & Co., Calder, Henderson & Livingston, Cant & Kemp, Edmiston & Mitchells, F. A. Lightbody & Co., McDowall & Neilson, Robt. Sheriff, Singleton, Dunn & Co., Wright, Graham & Co., Buchanan & French, Brownlee & Co., Ltd., Fraser, Taylor & Gibson, J. Herbert-son & Son, Wm. Shanks & Son, J. Scott, and Wylie, Stewart & Marshall.

THE SCOTCH BUILDING TRADE.
The new town hall at Jedburgh is to cost £5,600.
It has been proposed that £4,000 of the amount should be borrowed and the balance raised by bazaars, etc.
The new fever hospital at Stirling is expected to cost £7,000.
A Glasgow building, 25, New Wynd, in course of demolition, on Tuesday suddenly collapsed, injuring four men.
The master joiners of Dumfermline have this week conceded their employès a rise of wages to the extent of ½d. per hour.
The standard wage is now 8½d. an hour.

WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION CASE.
At the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, on 8th September, Andrew Milne sued Mr. Archibald M'Kelvie, Granton, under the Workmen's Compensation Act in respect of an accident which befel him on the 21st June last while engaged unloading battens in Granton Harbour.
The Sheriff found that plaintiff was not employed in or about a "factory" in the sense of the Act, and he dismissed the petition, allowing expenses to neither party.
In a note the Sheriff stated that it was not conclusive against the petitioner that the accident happened on board a ship.
If it had happened through the breakdown of the shore crane the case would, he said, have been within the Act.

THE TRADE OF THE CLYDE.—At the monthly meeting of the Clyde Trustees held at Glasgow, Mr. Gray, the convener of the Finance Committee, in making a statement with reference to the accounts of the trust for the year ending June 30th last, said that regarding tonnage dues on vessels, it would be found that they had increased by £10,000.
Rents from timber-yards showed an increase of about £2,000, which was the result of greater accommodation having been provided.
The same remark applied to the graving dock accommodation, the rents from which had increased from £13,000 to £21,000 in two years.

GAZETTE.
The following circular has been issued by the secretary of James Young & Sons (Ltd.):— "With reference to my circular of 19th ult., I am desired by the directors and by the committee representing the creditors to request your attendance at a meeting of the company's creditors, to be held within Dowell's Rooms, George Street, Edinburgh, upon Friday, the 15th inst., at three o'clock, when the committee will submit a report upon the affairs of the company, with recommendations as to the course to be adopted.
In the meantime I am instructed to state that it is the unanimous opinion of the committee that it is eminently desirable that the company should remain in a position permitting negotiations for the realisation of the plant and other assets to the greatest advantage.
The committee would therefore impress upon all creditors the expediency of their continuing to refrain from action against the company.—(Signed) JOHN FORREST, interim secretary."

DOCK STRIKE AT GRANGEMOUTH.—About 200 dock labourers have struck work at Grangemouth for an advance of 2d. per hour.
The shipping is consequently detained.
Several large steamers, with cargoes of wood, have just arrived.
The men are determined to hold out.

SAW MILL FATALITY.—On Tuesday night, Joseph Walker, labourer, aged 70, died in the Royal Infirmary, Aberdeen, from the effects of injuries received while at work in the woodyard of Messrs. John Fleming & Co., Albert Sawmills, early in the day.
Walker had been working on an overhead crane, when he lost his balance and fell to the ground, a distance of 14 feet.
He sustained a scalp wound, and several of his ribs were also broken.
