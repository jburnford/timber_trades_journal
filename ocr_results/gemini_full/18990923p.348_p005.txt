FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

DENNE, F. T., builder, Westgate-on-Sea.—The public examination of this debtor was held at the Canterbury Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week, before Mr. Registrar Gifford, the debtor being allowed to pass his examination. The accounts showed debts £140 15s. 11d., and net assets £157 10s. Creditors including—Nicholls and Co., timber merchants, Newport, £18, and £14 for joinery works, Newport, £11. The estate was left in the Official Receiver’s hands for administration in bankruptcy.

DODD, T. W., builder, High Bovey.—The receiving order in this case was made upon the petition of Mr. J. H. Vaughan, builder’s merchant, Maidenhead. At the public sitting held on Thursday before Mr. Registrar Gifford, the debtor was allowed to pass his examination. The accounts showing unsecured debts £598 14s. 11d., and debts fully secured £147, with estimated net assets £93 4s. 6d.

EDMUND, F. J., builder, Dover.—At the Canterbury Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday last, this case came up for his adjourned examination. The Official Receiver said he had not had an opportunity of investigating the statements made by the debtor as to the disposal of certain money which had gone through his hands. He therefore asked the Registrar to adjourn the examination for a month. The Registrar granted the application.

EDWARDS, EVAN LLOYD, and EDWARDS, RICHARD LLOYD, builders, Wavertree.—At the adjourned examination on Thursday last week, Evan Lloyd Edwards handed in a doctor’s certificate to the effect that his brother was suffering from catarrh and was advised not to leave the house.—The Registrar considered the certificate an unsatisfactory and indefinite one.—Mr. Ring, the Deputy Official Receiver, said that in bankruptcy, Evan Lloyd Edwards had had some bricks which were sold to a Mr. Mendal, a builder, and apparently had not been paid for. He was also examined as to the disappearance of a shed from the works.—The Registrar said the bankrupt’s answers were not satisfactory, and in the absence of the brother he could not close the examination.—The case was therefore adjourned to the 12th of October.

GRAHAM, JAMES, builder, gilder, &c., Road, lately of Medusa Road, Catford, Kent. The summary of debtor’s statement of affairs filed shews gross liabilities amounting to £8,555 0s. 2d., which includes £1,149 1s. 3d. to unsecured creditors, £7,403 1s. 11d. to creditors fully secured, estimated value of securities £8,030, and preference claims £2 3s. 6d., which is expected to rank for dividend £1,149 1s. 3d.; net assets £767 15s. 5d.; deficiency £381 19s. 10d. The debtor attributes his insolvency to damages being assessed against him in an

action taken against him under the Employ’rs Liability Act, law-costs, and depreciation in the value of his stock and plant, and he states that he did not become aware of his insolvency until about three weeks before he filed his petition. At the meeting of creditors, Mr. H. W. Figg, chartered accountant, 37, Upper Thames Street, London, E.C., was appointed trustee of the estate with a committee of inspection.

HIND, FRANK, timber dealer and builder, Belvedere, &c. In this matter the Registrar of the Rochester County Court (Mr. F. F. Smith), and the Official Receiver (Mr. R. W. Cave), held a further public examination of the debtor on Monday last, the 18th inst. Debtor has traded in a large way of business at Belvedere and Erith as a timber dealer, builder, and large contractor, &c. The total liabilities are stated to be £7,751 14s., and it is expected there will be a deficiency of £6,169 3s 10d. Since the last examination, the sale of debtor’s effects, which was advertised to take place, has been postponed, and the creditors have had a meeting, and appointed Mr. Ed. Allen, accountant, Eastgate, Rochester, as trustee of the estate. The public examination of the debtor was, therefore, only carried a very little further by the Official Receiver, and then he applied for a second adjournment, in order that the trustee might have an opportunity of going into matters in detail.—The Trustee said the whole case was very complicated, and it would be necessary to have a rather long adjournment.—Accordingly the Registrar further adjourned the matter until the 16th October.

JEWELL, H. A., late builder, 261, Stansted Road, Catford, S.E.—The debtor, now of 40, Chancery Lane, W.C., was brought to the court upon the petition of Mr. Jas. Fasnacht, architect, Aytoun Road, Brixton, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Friday, before Mr. Howell, Assistant Receiver. The debtor says he commenced business in the beginning of 1894, as a builder, at West Lodge, Clapham Common, with a capital of about £300, and had since conducted building operations in that district, and at Catford. The statutory accounts were not filed, but the debts were estimated at about £500, and the assets appeared to consist chiefly of an estimated surplus of £1,500 (subject to realisation) of mortgage property at Catford. In the absence of a quorum of creditors, the meeting was adjourned.

READ, CHARLIE, late speculative builder, Newport, Mon.—The debtor, now residing at Chester Road, Upton Park, filed his own petition, and the first meeting of creditors was held last week before Mr. C. A. Pope, Assistant Receiver. The debtor states that in July, 1886, with £150 capital, he started as a speculative builder at Newport, Mon., and carried on business until 1890, when he paid a composition of 5s. in the £ on liabilities of about £1,200. He then resumed speculative building at Barry, Glamorganshire, but the operations resulted in losses, and in October, 1893, he executed a deed of assignment, his debts amounting to about £1,000. He went back to Newport and re-commenced as a speculative builder there without capital, and he ascribed his insolvency to his inability to let or sell property in Risca Road, New-

then first became aware they were insolvent. The creditors appointed Mr. John Gordon, trustee, with a committee of inspection.

WHITTELL, HENRY EDWARD, timber dealer and builder, St. Margaret’s Bank, Rochester. This debtor appeared on Monday at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Smith, for further examination. The Official Receiver (Mr. R. W. Cave) questioned the debtor all through his various transactions, more particularly in regard to his building contracts, in which he has run into considerable debt for timber, slates, &c., with local merchants. Finally, the Registrar intimated that the case would be further adjourned until the 16th October, in order that debtor might produce his books and papers for the Official Receiver, and then probably the case would be closed on that date.

WOOLLS, T. J (deceased), late proprietor, Kennett Wharf, Upper Thames Street.—The proceedings instituted under the deed of assignment which the debtor executed on May 15th last, were on Tuesday last, before Mr. Registrar Linklater, ordered to be continued in bankruptcy. The creditors include Messrs. Foy, Morgan and Co., £2,000, and Messrs. Churchill and Sim, £1,000. The Court made an order that the administration should be administered in bankruptcy, and a meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday, before Mr. C. A Pope, Assistant Receiver, for the purpose of appointing a trustee. The proofs lodged included one for £315, by Mr. C. Pollard, timber merchant, of Wardrobe Chambers, E.C., and the creditors appointed Mr. J. H. Champness, of Wardrobe Chambers, E.C., as trustee of the estate. It was stated that about £1,000 had been realised, and was available for distribution.
