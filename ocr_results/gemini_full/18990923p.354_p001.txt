TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
The arrivals here during the past week include two full cargoes — the "George Thompson," from St. Anne des Monts, with spruce deals, for Singleton, Dunn & Co., and the "Mendota," from St. John, N.B., arrived with spruce deals and birch planks for Jas. Hunter and others. Two liners from Montreal are also to hand—the "Buen Ayrean," with pine deals and boards, for Edmiston & Mitchells, and spruce deals and birch planks, for Wright, Graham & Co., and the "Salacia," with consignments for Allison, Cousland & Co., Calder, Henderson & Livingston, and Singleton, Dunn & Co. There is a satisfactory business doing in deals. Spruce especially is holding very firm in price, and deliveries from the yards are well maintained.
The "Hestia," from Baltimore, is landing at Princes Dock oak planks and boards, a large variety of whitewood boards, two parcels pine, and 28 oak logs, for various consignees. From New Orleans, the "Telefora" has just arrived with over 160,000 staves, and several parcels of oak and whitewood boards, planks, and logs to several consignees, details of which are given in the accompanying list. Considerable activity is apparent in most hardwoods, and nearly all parcels coming to hand have found purchasers ex ship. Deliveries of mahogany since the auction sale last week have been going

on steadily, and the bulk of the wood is already removed from Queen's Dock.
The outlook for trade continues good, and saw-mills are fully employed.
Gilmour & Aitken held, on the 20th inst., a sale of various sawn hardwoods, including mahogany, walnut, wainscot, and American oak, ash, etc. This is the first auction held by this firm, and the result must have been gratifying. With a good company of buyers present and good prices ruling, Mr. Aitken, who acted as auctioneer, got quickly through the catalogue, withdrawing only a few lots. A considerable quantity of veneers was also disposed of, although not in the catalogue, and a fair amount of business, after the sale, was done privately.

LEITH.
There is a smaller importation of wood to report this week, comprising merely a parcel of deals by the Riga steamer, a sailer with battens from Helsingfors, a steamer with deals and battens from Drontheim, and a considerable shipment of waney pine and hardwood logs with pine deals and boards, per (ss) "Eva," from Montreal. Some of this last is for transhipment to Aberdeen, so that the whole will not come on this market. A local holiday on the 18th inst. somewhat interrupted business this week, and the tendency is towards some slackening in the activity which has prevailed for some time back. This may be only the customary falling off of orders towards the close of the quarter, and if so it will soon pass away.
