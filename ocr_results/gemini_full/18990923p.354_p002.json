At the county demonstration farm\nan area of poor pasture has been laid off with\nthe object of illustrating certain principles of\nforestry and of carrying out some simple ex-\nperiments. In addition to a shelter belt of\nScots firs arranged to illustrate rival methods\nof planting, there are ten sections intended to\ndemonstrate the merits of different varieties\nand mixtures of trees, and a section is stocked\nwith Norway spruce and ash, shade-bearing\nand light-demanding trees, the former protect-\ning the soil for the benefit of the latter.\nOther sections include pure Scots firs, an ex-\nample of a wood of light trees, pure Douglas\nfirs, pure Sitka spruce, pure Norway spruce,\nwhich with the Sitka spruce is intended to\nproduce pitwood on a 35 or 40 years’ rotation ;\nGerman larch and Scots firs dividing a section\nwith a mixture of birch and oak ; and in\nanother section the comparative merits of three\nkinds of larch will be tested, while a mixture\nof larch with a shade-bearing tree is also\nto be illustrated.
