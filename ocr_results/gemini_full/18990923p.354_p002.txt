A HISTORIC CHAIR.
A gentleman residing at Wanstead is now
the owner of the throne chair sent secretly by
Napoleon III. into Germany to be used by
him in dictating terms to the fallen Teutons
in Berlin. The chair is a colossal fabric, al-
together more massive and commanding than
the present throne in the House of Lords. It
is magnificently carved in solid wood and up-
holstered in a magnificent tapestry silk. The
floriated back is surmounted by the Imperial
eagle and crown, culminating in the globe and
cross. The arm rests conceal musical boxes,
and the whole seat is said to have cost £400.
It was discovered in a packing case in Berlin,
and taken by an hotel keeper for the board
of three Frenchmen who had charge of it and
fled after Sedan. Colonel North “discovered”
the chair after it had been lost to sight for
many years.
:o:
Mr. Wm. Kerr, joiner, of Kirkliston died on
Thursday, last week.
DUNDEE.—In the building and woodworking
trades at Dundee employment continues good.
Societies with 1,764 members give 20 as idle, as
compared with eight at the end of July.
COATBRIDGE.—At Coatbridge Lifeboat Satur-
day procession last Saturday, Mr. John Twaddle,
East-end Sawmills, had a model house carried
upon a lorry. The house was elaborately
dressed up in curled shavings, inside were men
employed at wood-turning, and on the top was
a splendid model yacht. The whole turn-out
attracted a great deal of attention.

FORESTRY EXPERIMENTS IN NORTHUMBERLAND.
Sylviculture is a neglected industry in this
country, and the Northumberland County
Council is understood to be the first among
local authorities to devote attention to the
subject. At the county demonstration farm
an area of poor pasture has been laid off with
the object of illustrating certain principles of
forestry and of carrying out some simple ex-
periments. In addition to a shelter belt of
Scots firs arranged to illustrate rival methods
of planting, there are ten sections intended to
demonstrate the merits of different varieties
and mixtures of trees, and a section is stocked
with Norway spruce and ash, shade-bearing
and light-demanding trees, the former protect-
ing the soil for the benefit of the latter.
Other sections include pure Scots firs, an ex-
ample of a wood of light trees, pure Douglas
firs, pure Sitka spruce, pure Norway spruce,
which with the Sitka spruce is intended to
produce pitwood on a 35 or 40 years’ rotation ;
German larch and Scots firs dividing a section
with a mixture of birch and oak ; and in
another section the comparative merits of three
kinds of larch will be tested, while a mixture
of larch with a shade-bearing tree is also
to be illustrated. It is obvious that several
years must pass before these demonstrations
and experiments can be of much value as
object-lessons.
