Upon the case being called, the Assistant Official Receiver stated that the amended statement of affairs, which was in the hands of the debtor's solicitor had not yet been filed, and the trustee of the estate had not therefore been able to make such investigations as he should like. He eventually decided to adjourn the examination until the next sitting of the court.\nUSE K B SAWN AND HANDRIVEN PL[?]",
