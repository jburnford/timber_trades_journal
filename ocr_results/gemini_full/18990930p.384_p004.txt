FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BROWN BROS., builders, Bramley, Guildford.—The public examination of the above-named debtors was appointed to be held at the last sitting of the Guildford Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar. Upon the case being called, the Assistant Official Receiver stated that the amended statement of affairs which was in the hands of the debtor's solicitor had not yet been filed, and the trustee of the estate had not yet had time to make such investigations as he should like. It was eventually decided to adjourn the examination until the next sitting of the court.
GOATLEY, ALBERT EDWARD, builder, 17, Cotford Road, Thornton Heath—This bankrupt attended at the Croydon Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Fox, for his public examination. He stated, in reply to the Assistant Official Receiver, that he commenced business in November, 1897, and since November last he had been working as a carpenter. He had no capital when he started. He traded in his own name. Pressed, he admitted that the style was Goatley Bros. That was because he expected a brother would have joined him, but he did not do so. That brother received nothing from the business. The work was entirely contract. He took out no quantities, but prepared rough estimates. He had made profit on jobbing work, but had no contract on which he made a profit. He kept no accounts, nor at any time prepared an account of his position.—The examination was closed.
HAMMOND, C. W. O. F., builder, 19 Eveline Road, Nunhead, S.E. The bankrupt attended for public examination on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Gifford, his accounts showing unsecured debts £472 16s. 5d., and debts fully secured £405, with assets nil. It appeared from his statements that he had for about 18 months previous to his failure traded as above, and he attributed his failure to the result of a breach of promise action brought against him in 1898. That action was eventually settled by the payment of £210 for damages and costs, but the bankrupt failed to discharge the costs of his solicitor in the matter, and the latter thereupon recovered judgment for the amount, and afterwards obtained the receiving order. The bankrupt also stated that his failure was partly due to the loss of about £150 under a building contract. The examination was closed.

and assets, consisting of cash in hand, 10s. 6d.; stock-in-trade, £50; machinery, £1 5s.; farming stock, £23; growing crops and tenant rights, 15s.; other property, £60; book debts (good), £14 3s.; making £129 13s. 6d., less £12 8s. 3d. for preference creditors, which leaves net assets £116 17s. 3d. and shows a deficiency of £622 10s. 7d.

MARRABLE, RICHARD JOHN OLINCH, builder, Alma Grove, Bromley, Kent.—Bankrupt attended at the Croydon Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Fox, for his public examination. Mr T. W. Britten, Assistant Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade. Bankrupt said that he was now a journeyman carpenter. He commenced business as a builder in 1897. He had been a foreman of carpenters before. His capital was £160—equity of a leasehold house. In December, 1897, he had a deficiency of £57, but he continued trading, and had incurred several liabilities since. He stopped when he was unable to get further credit. He attributed his failure to taking contracts at too low a price. He took out no quantities; simply jumped at the amount, and he had lost on all he took. He also built speculatively. Kept no books of account.—The examination closed.
HURST, STEPHEN, builder and contractor, Putney, Mortlake, and Brondesbury.—A sitting for public examination was held in this case on Tuesday, before Mr. Registrar Gifford. The accounts, as amended, disclosed an unsecured indebtedness of £24,695 17s.; and debts fully secured £23,700, with assets (including a surplus of £7,050 from securities held by creditor) estimated by the debtor to produce £7,292 17s. 6d. On examination by Mr C. W. Chapman, Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he was previously adjudged bankrupt in 1883, his unsecured liabilities then amounting to £5,303. No dividend was declared under those proceedings, and he obtained his discharge in August, 1889. He then, with £250 capital (partly borrowed) re-commenced business as a speculative builder, and he had since erected properties at Richmond, Woking, Crouch End, Thornton Heath, Westerham, Harrow, Putney, Mortlake, Brondesbury, and Wandsworth. The debtor attributed his present failure to loss in respect of building speculations at Crouch End, Harrow, Thornton Heath, and Mortlake, also to his inability to realize his mortgaged properties to advantage.
STANLEY, WALTER, builder, 106, South View Crescent, Sheffield.—The first meeting of the creditors concerned under this failure was held on Friday last at the offices of the Official Receiver, Sheffield. It appeared that the debtor commenced business in February last as a builder, without any capital of his own. He was formerly a draughtsman in the employ of the Sheffield Corporation. He alleged his failure to have been caused through bad trade and want of capital. The estate was eventually left in the hands of the Official Receiver for summary administration in the usual manner.
SINCLAIR, THOMAS WILLIAM, coach-builder, 110, Northgate-street and Old Post Office-yard, the East-gate, Chester.—The first meeting of creditors has been held in the above case. The gross liabilities are figured over £1,036; the actual deficiency shown is £125. Failure is alleged to be due to “quietness of trade.” Debtor opened in 1883. The Deputy Official Receiver stated that debtor’s business was still being carried on to complete certain contracts. Mr. Small, senr., was appointed trustee, with a committee of inspection.
THOMPSON, ROBERT MILLIGAN, builder, 4, Bronte Street, Sunderland Road, Gateshead.—In this recent failure the following are trade creditors:—
Scott, Jas. & Son, Newcastle ... 37 9 9
Griggs, J., Loughborough ... 17 19 0
Carr, J., junr., Newcastle ... 20 9 7
Brown, C., Hartlepool ... 20 0 0
Taylor, J., Newcastle ... 28 10 0
WALKER, THOMAS, builder, &c., of Coundon, Bishop Auckland.—At the Durham Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday last, before Mr. Registrar Marshall, the above came up for his first public examination in bankruptcy. The statement of affairs showed that his liabilities were £356 0s. 6d. and the assets £31 11s. 2d., leaving a deficiency of £324 9s. 4d. Debtor alleged that his failure was caused by illness of his wife, and the signing of some bills [?].
JAS. GILLINGS, builder and contractor, Garden Street, Cromer, Norfolk.—Accounts had been filed in this case showing gross liabilities, £2,396 14s. 4d., made up as follows: To unsecured creditors, £508 17s. 10d.; to secured creditors, £1,060 10s.; estimated value of securities, £1,600; surplus of £539 10s. carried to sheet “(1)”; to partly secured creditors, £670, less estimated value of securities, £539 10s., which leaves £130 10s. rank; total unsecured liabilities, £639 7s. 10d.
