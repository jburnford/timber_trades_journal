Besides the usual\nparcels by steamers from Riga, Baltimore,\nand Montreal, there are steamer cargoes of\ndeals and battens from Libau, St. Petersburg,\nand Wyburg, and sailer cargoes from Rafso\nand Porsgrund.\nThe weather has been very stormy and\nwet, which has interfered considerably with\nthe work of discharging and piling the\ncargoes now in dock, besides affecting pre-\njudicially all outside work.\nThere was a public sale held on Tuesday,\nat the Edinburgh Dock, by D. W. Beattie.\nThe goods offered included fresh shipments\nfrom St. Petersburg and Rafso, besides a\nvariety of earlier imported cargoes. The\nweather conditions were not favourable to a\nlarge attendance, and the overturn was\ncorrespondingly restricted. Prices ruled\nsteady at the recent advance, especially for\nall the better qualities of red deals and\nbattens.\n\nSeptember 30, 1899.\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL\n\nCampbells, Wilkie & Downes, Ltd.,\nTIMBER MERCHANTS AND SAW MILLERS,\nWINDSOR SAW MILLS,\nCAMPBELL STREET, GOVAN\nTeak, Mahogany, Walnut, Canary Coloured Whitewood, Birch,\nAsh, Oak, Kauri Pine, Cedar, etc., etc., in logs\nand seasoned boards.\nWalnut, Burr & p.p.\nand Knife Cut Veneers, Yellow Pine and\nSpruce Deals,\nFloorings, Linings and Battens, Mouldings\nin all woods.\nTelegraphic Address—\"KAURI, GLASGOW.\"\n\nIMPORTS.\nALLOA.\nSept. 20 Mathilda-Gothenburg-330 lds. pitprops\n-Jas.

Mr. Kemp was only 36 years of age, and\nabout seven years ago he, along with Mr.\nJames Cant, inaugurated the firm of Cant &\nKemp, timber brokers, Glasgow.\nHis business life was entirely in the timber\ntrade; when a lad he went to Thomson &\nGray, teak importers, as clerk and afterwards\nsalesman, and remained in their employ ten\nyears, thereafter he became principal salesman\nin the hardwood department of Brownlee &\nCo., and as their buyer was a frequent attender\nat mahogany and hardwood sales at Liverpool\nand London, as well as at Glasgow, leaving\nthis firm on beginning business.\nThe deceased gentleman had been in fail-\ning health for about two years, having suffered\nfrom pleurisy after influenza, and was laid\naside from business for a considerable time.\nAfter a prolonged holiday, he sufficiently re-\ncovered to return to business, and appeared\nmuch improved in health, but, unfortunately,\nabout a month ago he was again laid aside,\nand passed away on Tuesday last.\nMr. Kemp's father, the late Dr. Kemp, of\nGlasgow High School, was well known in\neducational circles, and received the degree\nof LL.D from the University.\nMr. Kemp was married only a few years\nago, and leaves a widow and two children to\nmourn their loss.\n\nFRANCIS WALKINGSHAW.\nWe regret to announce the death, which\ntook place on the 22nd inst., of Mr. Francis\nWalkingshaw, senior partner in the firm of\nFrancis Walkingshaw & Co., timber mer-\nchants, of Edinburgh. The circumstances\nconnected with the late Mr. Walkingshaw's\ndemise are particularly distressing. Three\nweeks ago his wife passed away, followed a\nfortnight later by his daughter. The deceased\ngentleman was struck with paralysis on Fri-\nday, the 17th inst., which resulted fatally, as\nstated above, on the following Friday.\nMr. Francis Walkingshaw was well known\nin Edinburgh and district, and traded prin-\ncipally in hardwoods. Some 10 years ago he\nassumed his brother-in-law, Mr. Watson, as\npartner. From that time the deceased did not\ntake the same active interest in the business\nas he had done previously. He leaves a son\nand daughter to mourn their loss.\n\nSEQUESTRATIONS.—William Aitken Stewart,\nslater and plasterer, Dunbeth Road, Coat-\nbridge. Creditors to meet in the Faculty\nHall, St. George's Place, Glasgow, on Wed-\nnesday, at 12 o'clock—John Notman, builder,\nTrees House, Barrhead. Creditors to meet in\nthe Globe Hotel, Paisley, on Friday, at 12\no'clock.\n\nRENFREW.—Mr. Thos. Sang, saw-miller, has\nremoved his plant of turner's machinery and\ntools to Lobnitz & Co., Ltd., Renfrew,\non Friday last week.\n\nBEITH.—On Thursday last week, the cabinet\nand chair manufactory of Turner & Paterson,\nVictoria Works, Beith, was discovered to be\non fire. The fire brigade was hastily sum-\nmoned, but though they made every effort to\nstay the progress of the conflagration, it was\napparent that the works were doomed. By\nmidnight the roofs and walls had collapsed,\nleaving nothing but a mass of ruins. The\nwhole of Turner & Paterson's machinery and\nstock were destroyed, while a large quantity\nof valuable wood in the yard was badly\ndamaged. The loss is very considerable, and\nis only partly covered by insurance.\n\nTHE NEW FORESTERS' HALL FOR DUNDEE.\nThe proposal to erect a new Foresters' hall in\nDundee has been received with general ap-\nproval by the various Courts throughout the\ncity. Some time must elapse yet before pos-\nsession of the ground can be obtained, the plans,\nhowever, have been prepared, and these in-\ndicate that a handsome building will be\nerected. It is proposed to have one large hall\ncapable of accommodating 900 persons, while\ntwo other smaller halls are to be provided\nwith accommodation for 300 in each. In ad-\ndition there are to be a number of committee\nrooms and other apartments suitable for\nSociety meetings, &c.\n\nESTABLISHED 1852. TELEPHONE No 602\nM. & J.
