GLASGOW.
Owing to the boisterous weather many
logs of timber broke adrift this week in the
ponds at the east end of Port Glasgow.
The steam launch "Hound," belonging to Mr.
Laird, timber measurer, was struck by one
of the logs which, piercing her side, caused
the vessel to sink; she is now reported to
have become a total loss.

LEITH.
There are more liberal arrivals of wood
during the last seven days, including some
important shipments. Besides the usual
parcels by steamers from Riga, Baltimore,
and Montreal, there are steamer cargoes of
deals and battens from Libau, St. Petersburg,
and Wyburg, and sailer cargoes from Rafso
and Porsgrund.
The weather has been very stormy and
wet, which has interfered considerably with
the work of discharging and piling the
cargoes now in dock, besides affecting pre-
judicially all outside work.
There was a public sale held on Tuesday,
at the Edinburgh Dock, by D. W. Beattie.
The goods offered included fresh shipments
from St. Petersburg and Rafso, besides a
variety of earlier imported cargoes. The
weather conditions were not favourable to a
large attendance, and the overturn was
correspondingly restricted. Prices ruled
steady at the recent advance, especially for
all the better qualities of red deals and
battens.

OBITUARY.
JOHN CHARLES KEMP
The death of Mr. John Charles Kemp, which
occurred on the 26th inst., at his residence
at Jordanhill, near Glasgow, has created a
deep feeling of regret amongst his friends in
the timber trade. Mr. Kemp was only 36 years of age, and
about seven years ago he, along with Mr.
James Cant, inaugurated the firm of Cant &
Kemp, timber brokers, Glasgow.
His business life was entirely in the timber
trade; when a lad he went to Thomson &
Gray, teak importers, as clerk and afterwards
salesman, and remained in their employ ten
years, thereafter he became principal salesman
in the hardwood department of Brownlee &
Co., and as their buyer was a frequent attender
at mahogany and hardwood sales at Liverpool
and London, as well as at Glasgow, leaving
this firm on beginning business.
The deceased gentleman had been in fail-
ing health for about two years, having suffered
from pleurisy after influenza, and was laid
aside from business for a considerable time.
After a prolonged holiday, he sufficiently re-
covered to return to business, and appeared
much improved in health, but, unfortunately,
about a month ago he was again laid aside,
and passed away on Tuesday last.
Mr. Kemp's father, the late Dr. Kemp, of
Glasgow High School, was well known in
educational circles, and received the degree
of LL.D from the University.
Mr. Kemp was married only a few years
ago, and leaves a widow and two children to
mourn their loss.

FRANCIS WALKINGSHAW.
We regret to announce the death, which
took place on the 22nd inst., of Mr. Francis
Walkingshaw, senior partner in the firm of
Francis Walkingshaw & Co., timber mer-
chants, of Edinburgh. The circumstances
connected with the late Mr. Walkingshaw's
demise are particularly distressing. Three
weeks ago his wife passed away, followed a
fortnight later by his daughter. The deceased
gentleman was struck with paralysis on Fri-
day, the 17th inst., which resulted fatally, as
stated above, on the following Friday.
Mr. Francis Walkingshaw was well known
in Edinburgh and district, and traded prin-
cipally in hardwoods. Some 10 years ago he
assumed his brother-in-law, Mr. Watson, as
partner. From that time the deceased did not
take the same active interest in the business
as he had done previously. He leaves a son
and daughter to mourn their loss.

SEQUESTRATIONS.—William Aitken Stewart,
slater and plasterer, Dunbeth Road, Coat-
bridge. Creditors to meet in the Faculty
Hall, St. George's Place, Glasgow, on Wed-
nesday, at 12 o'clock—John Notman, builder,
Trees House, Barrhead. Creditors to meet in
the Globe Hotel, Paisley, on Friday, at 12
o'clock.

RENFREW.—Mr. Thos. Sang, saw-miller, has
removed his plant of turner's machinery and
tools to Lobnitz & Co., Ltd., Renfrew,
on Friday last week.

BEITH.—On Thursday last week, the cabinet
and chair manufactory of Turner & Paterson,
Victoria Works, Beith, was discovered to be
on fire. The fire brigade was hastily sum-
moned, but though they made every effort to
stay the progress of the conflagration, it was
apparent that the works were doomed. By
midnight the roofs and walls had collapsed,
leaving nothing but a mass of ruins. The
whole of Turner & Paterson's machinery and
stock were destroyed, while a large quantity
of valuable wood in the yard was badly
damaged. The loss is very considerable, and
is only partly covered by insurance.

THE NEW FORESTERS' HALL FOR DUNDEE.
The proposal to erect a new Foresters' hall in
Dundee has been received with general ap-
proval by the various Courts throughout the
city. Some time must elapse yet before pos-
session of the ground can be obtained, the plans,
however, have been prepared, and these in-
dicate that a handsome building will be
erected. It is proposed to have one large hall
capable of accommodating 900 persons, while
two other smaller halls are to be provided
with accommodation for 300 in each. In ad-
dition there are to be a number of committee
rooms and other apartments suitable for
Society meetings, &c.
