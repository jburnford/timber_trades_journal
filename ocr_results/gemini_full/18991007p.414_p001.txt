before the Registrar, but upon the case being called on for hearing the debtor did not respond to his name. The Official Receiver said he had reasons for believing that the debtor had disobeyed since the last sitting the orders of the Court, therefore he should apply for a warrant for the arrest of the debtor. The Registrar acceded to the application of the Official Receiver, and the warrant was made out accordingly.
COOKE, C. A., builder, 59, Edward Road, Walthamstow.—The debtor lately carried on business in Stratford, and under a receiving order recently made against him upon the petition of Mr. Martin Bleick, timber merchant, of Walthamstow, the first meeting of his creditors was held on Tuesday, before Mr. E. L. Hough, Senior Official Receiver. No statement of affairs was filed, but the liabilities are estimated at about £450, and there are no assets.
The debtor states that he began business 20 years ago with a capital of from £400 to £500. In about 1890 he failed, but subsequently obtained his discharge under the proceedings. His present position was due to losses on speculative operations, and also to expenses incurred through continued illness. He now made no offer, and the matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver for administration in bankruptcy.
HIBBERT, MRS. COTTRILL, joiner, builder and contractor, 54, Freme Street, Chorlton-on-Medlock, and 17, Hyde Road, Manchester.—In this failure the liabilities amount to £564 11s. and the assets are stated to be £192 8s. 6d. a deficiency of £372 3s 4d. The following are trade creditors :—

KEMP, COLIN, builder, Headley, near Liphook, Southampton.—Debtor states that he commenced business at Headley in November, 1892, but without capital, and that he has continued to carry on business at the same place ever since that date. The debtor has not as yet filed a complete statement of affairs, but he states that his unsecured liabilities amount to about £500, to meet which he discloses assets, which he estimates will realise about £260. The debtor attributes his insolvency to losses made through taking contracts at too low a price, and he states that he became aware of his insolvency last Christmas, at which date he admits having contracted almost the whole of his present liabilities.
MERREDEW & WORT, builders and contractors, Stevenage, Herts.—Under a receiving order recently made against this firm, a preliminary meeting of creditors was held at the London Bankruptcy Court last week, before Mr. Ewen, Official Receiver.—Mr. Horace Barrett attended the meeting on behalf of the debtor. The statement of affairs was not lodged, but the liabilities were estimated at about £7,000, while the assets, consisting of plant, and the debtor's interest in certain contracts, were valued at £1,300.—The Chairman stated that the meeting had been summoned in order that he might ascertain the wishes of creditors with respect to the carrying on of several contracts which the debtors had in hand at Ipswich, Hatfield, Aylesbury, and elsewhere. According to the debtor's statement, certain funds would have to be pro-
