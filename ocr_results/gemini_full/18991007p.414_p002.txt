FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BEACH, HERBERT, builder and contractor, Kerley.-At the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last, the public examination of this debtor was closed.
BOWEN, EVAN, builder, Merthyr.-This debtor was to have attended for his public examination on Tuesday at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court, but when the case was called there was no response and Mr. Hughes, who applied for a warrant for debtor's arrest, the Official Receiver supported the application, and was informed that debtor had absconded. It was then agreed that the application should be made on affidavit.
BROUGHTON, WEBSTER, builder, Raymond Terrace, Lowtown, Pudsey.-A preparatory meeting of the creditors connected with this failure was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Leeds, on Friday last. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £732 7s. 7d., and the assets were estimated to produce £28 18s. 6d. The failure was attributed to "loss on the sale of property, law costs, and interest on borrowed money, owing to insufficiency of capital." A resolution was passed at the meeting.
BROWNLEY, ALFRED, joiner and builder, Adlington...
