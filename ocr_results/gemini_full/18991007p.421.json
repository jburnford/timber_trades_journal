The testimonial consisted of a handsome oak box containing a large silver tea tray, a silver kettle with stand, a tea set, and a coffee pot. The tray, which is surmounted by the burgh coat-of-arms, contains the following inscription :—“Presented, along with a silver tea and coffee service, to George Cadell Stewart, Provost of Bo’ness, by inhabitants and friends, as a mark of their esteem and appreciation of his services.—Bo’ness, 22nd September, 1899.” The gift to Mrs. Stewart was a substantial dressing-case of crocodile leather, beautifully lined with green. The letters “T.T.S.” are on the case.\nThe gathering was a representative one, and was largely composed of ladies. Mr. H. M. Cadell, of Grange, who presided, was accompanied on the platform by Provost Stewart, Mr. Alex. Ure, Q.C., M.P.; Bailie Baxter, Dean of Guild Marshall, and others.\nMr. H. M. Cadell, in the course of a long speech, said that Provost Stewart had, through his business capacity, and with his partners, built up from the ground within the last 20 years, a large and flourishing industry in Bo’ness, the name of his firm being a household word in the mining world, and far beyond it. The vast stacks of mining timber that now formed conspicuous landmarks in Bo’ness and other Scottish seaport towns, testified to the importance of the industry, while the facilities that are thus afforded for getting pitwood easily, cheaply, and of the requisite size, have no doubt been vastly beneficial to the coal mining industry of our country. Such enterprise has, no doubt, like our old friend, Honesty, continued Mr. Cadell, been its own reward in some degree, but its application to the weal of the community deserves, I think, our special recognition to-day. The tokens of our esteem may be considered in some degree emblematic of Provost Stewart’s public work, and they represent the good wishes of all classes of the community, over 400 subscribers of various sums from a penny to £5 having contributed towards them. The brilliant tea service and tray that he has been pleased to accept are suggestive of his own brilliant services to Bo’ness.\nMr. Alex. Ure, M.P., having in a suitable speech made the presentation.\nMr. Provost Stewart said he would value the gifts, not so much for their beauty and intrinsic worth, as he did in that they expressed to him the feeling of confidence in him which so many of his fellow townsmen thus showed, a feeling which, he trusted, they would have no cause to lose during the time which may remain to him in which he could still render service to his native place.\n\nJAMES JONES,\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\nLARBERT.",
