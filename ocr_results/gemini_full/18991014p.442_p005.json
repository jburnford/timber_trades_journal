After examining each of the debtors, the examination was adjourned until November 14th, the debtors being instructed to make themselves acquainted with the details of the statement of affairs before that time.\nDAVIES, EDWIN, builder, Llantwit Major (Glam.).—The first meeting of creditors was held at the Official Receiver's Office, Cardiff, on Thursday last week. Debtor's statement of affairs shewed liabilities £663 10s. 9d., and assets £109 4s., a deficiency of £554 6s. 9d. About half a-dozen creditors now attended and debtor was catechised as to certain points, and as the meeting eventually passed no resolutions, the Official Receiver remains trustee.\nEVANS, JOHN JAMES, builder, Hermonroad, Tywith, Maesteg.—The first meeting of the creditors under this failure was held on Friday last, at the Offices of the Official Receiver, Cardiff. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £1,762 10s. 11d., of which £575 9s. 6d. was expected to rank. The nett assets were returned at £250 3s. 9d., thus leaving a deficiency of £325 5s. 11d. The debtor alleged his failure had been caused through losses on building contracts, and depreciation in the value of property. It appeared that the debtor commenced\n\nTHE STRAND WOOD COMPANY, Ltd.\n(Incorporating TRAVARU-AKTIEBOLAGET STRAND-SORVIK, TRAVARU-AKTIEBOLAGET KOVDA)\nSaw Mills and Shipping Places—THE STRAND MILLS, SUNDSVALL, Sweden.

He alleged that he lost £700 on a contract that he entered into in 1897, for the erection of 40 cottages. No resolutions being passed, the estate will be wound up by the Official Receiver in the usual manner.\nFINCH, ALBERT, joiner, Aston Upthorpe, Berks.—The public examination of this debtor was appointed to be held at the Oxford Bankruptcy Court on the 5th inst., before Mr. Registrar Walsh, but upon the case being called on for hearing, the debtor did not respond to his name, and the Official Receiver stated he had been informed that the debtor had absconded, therefore he must ask that the examination be adjourned sine die. The examination was accordingly adjourned.\nGORDON, WILLIAM MAXWELL, timber merchant, Moscow Drive, Liverpool.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor was held on Thursday last, at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court, when debtor was questioned about his bank pass book, which he said he had mislaid. Eventually the examination was adjourned for three weeks, and in the mean time, the debtor was instructed to find the book and hand it to the Official Receiver.\nHARVEY, SAMUEL TAYLOR, and HARVEY, TAYLOR JOHN ALLEN, builders, la. The Pavement, Crofton Park, Brockley, trading in co-partnership under the style of Allen, Harvey & Co., at the above address, and both residing at Grove Lodge, Crofton Park, Brockley, S.E. The statutory meeting of the creditors interested under this failure took place at the offices of the Official Receiver for the Greenwich district, Railway Approach, London Bridge, S.E., on Thursday afternoon last week. The statement of affairs filed by the debtors disclosed gross liabilities £39,416 12s. 10d., of which £9,413 0s. 10d. was due to unsecured creditors. To fully secured creditors £29,975 10s. 6d. the value of securities being returned at £38,510, thus showing an estimated surplus of £8,534 9s. 6d., which is carried out as an asset. The assets consist of the estimated surplus, £8,534 9s. 6d., stock-in-trade, plant, &c., on building sites, subject to the claims of the freeholders, valued at £3,637 5s. 5d., and other property, making altogether £12,316 6s. 3d., from which £28 1s. 6d. had to be deducted for the claims of preferential creditors payable in full, leaving nett assets at £12,288 4s. 9d. After further discussion, it was proposed and seconded that Mr. Fredk. W. Davis, accountant, of Finsbury Pavement, E.C., be appointed trustee of the estate to act in conjunction with a committee of inspection. The Official Receiver stated that the examination was appointed to be held on the 17th inst. at the Greenwich County Court, but to save the creditors unnecessary trouble, he should apply for an adjournment of the examination.\nIVAS, THOMAS HENRY, builder, Maude Villas, Fordwater Road, Chertsey.—The public examination of this debtor was appointed to be held at the Kingston Bankruptcy Court, before the Registrar last week, but he was unable to attend through illness, consequently the examination was ordered to be adjourned until November.\nJEWELL, W. A., builder, 40, Chancery Lane, W.C., and late of Catford.—The adjourned first meeting of creditors under a receiving order made against this debtor was held on Friday, the 6th inst., before Mr. G. W. Chapman, Official Receiver. The debtor began business in 1894, at Clapham Common, with a capital of £200. Since August last he had been engaged entirely on commission, and he attributed his insolvency to the result of an action brought against him a month or two ago. He now made no proposal, and the matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver to be wound up in bankruptcy.\nMERREDEW & WORT, builders and contractors, Stevenage, Herts.—The first meeting of creditors under a receiving order made against this firm was held on Tuesday, at the London Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Ewen, Official Receiver. The statement of affairs was filed, showing total liabilities £12,658 16s. 2d., of which £9,087 13s. 6d. is expected to rank, and assets estimated to realise £6,634 7s. 2d., leaving a deficiency of £2,453 6s. 4d.

Those contracts were continued by Mr. Davis, and it was now for the creditors to appoint a trustee to wind up the estate in bankruptcy. Mr. A. C. Bourner, the debtor, said he was prepared on behalf of the debtors to make any offer, and a resolution for bankruptcy was thereupon passed. Mr. Davis, for certain reasons, refused to act as trustee, and Mr. A. C. Bourner, chartered accountant, of Bush Lane House, E.C., was nominated to that office. As an amendment, Mr. Wm. Messent, of Willoughby Road, Ipswich, was also nominated, but upon the voting of the creditors, it was resolved that Mr. Bourner should be appointed, and he was therefore withdrawn. A committee of inspection was also appointed, consisting of Mr. W. Todd, Mr. Frederick Bird, Mr. James Bristow, Mr. L. Somerville, and Mr. J. Tinnus. It was also resolved that Mr. Davis should continue in his capacity as special manager of the business until the trustee was certified by the Board of Trade.\nMORRIS, WILLIAM, builder and contractor, 14, Greenfield Terrace, Penygrraig, Glam.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor was fixed for Tuesday, at Pontypridd, before Mr. Registrar Spickett, the gross liabilities being figured at £2,599 19s. 9d., of which £391 5s. 1d. was expected to rank for dividend, £2,208 being fully secured. The assets were placed at £2585 8s. 9d., showing an estimated surplus of £284 1s. 5d. Failure was attributed by debtor to the Welsh coal strike (affecting the price of property) and claims for timber trade firms. Mr. D. Rees appeared for Mr. Dovey, Cardiff, the trustee, and Mr. Moses Thomas, Aberavon, for debtor.—The case was adjourned to the November sitting so that the accounts could be checked.\nSTANLEY, WALTER, builder, Cemetery Road and South View Crescent, Sheffield.—The public examination of the above named debtor took place at the Sheffield Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Binney. Replying to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor said he started business in February last with £25 which he borrowed. He was previously employed as a draughtsman under the Corporation. He denied that he had done any gambling beyond a few shilling bets, and explained his daily visits to a certain public house by stating that he was a personal friend of his.\nWHITFIELD, JOHN & RICHARD, builders, formerly of Stanningley Road, Bramley, and now residing at 8, Ascot Place, Pudsey, Leeds.—On the 9th inst. debtors applied at the Leeds Bankruptcy Court for their discharge, but the application was refused.\n\nOctober 14, 1899\nattendance of Mr. Howgate, on whom\nBANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS\nRECEIVING ORDERS.\nBoon, Francis Wm., builder, &c., Lichfield\nHall, Jn.
