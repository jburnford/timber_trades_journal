In the year prior to the one which is under review, linings were 649 in number, with a valuation of £2,106,760. Last year they had an increase in the number of linings to 681, but a decrease in valuation to £2,017,330. In the memorandum giving the details of their work for this year, he found that houses and shops decreased in linings from 167 to 114, with a corresponding decrease of valuation from £1,240,410 to £921,385.\n—:o:—\nA fire broke out at the Morayshire saw-mills, Elgin, belonging to A.
