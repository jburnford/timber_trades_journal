THE BUILDING TRADE IN GLASGOW
At the opening of the Glasgow Dean of Guild Court, Sir James Bell, Bart., the Lord Dean of Guild, said, in referring to the leading features of their work during the year ending August last, that the activity in the building trade of Glasgow, which began to show itself in 1891-2, and increased year by year until it reached its highest point last year, has shown very little evidence of quieter trade. In the year prior to the one which is under review, linings were 649 in number, with a valuation of £2,106,760. Last year they had an increase in the number of linings to 681, but a decrease in valuation to £2,017,330. In the memorandum giving the details of their work for this year, he found that houses and shops decreased in linings from 167 to 114, with a corresponding decrease of valuation from £1,240,410 to £921,385.

A fire broke out at the Morayshire saw-mills, Elgin, belonging to A. R. Watson & Co., and before it was got under damage had been done to the extent of over £10,000.
A fire broke out in the cooperage of Mr. George Gorrod, Regent Quay, Aberdeen. The damage before the fire brigade reached the scene, was done to the extent of between £2,000 and £3,000. The damage is covered by insurance.
