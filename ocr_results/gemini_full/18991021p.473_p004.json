The Registrar said he would give the debtors one more opportunity of complying with the order of the Court, and the examination was accordingly adjourned until Friday night.\n\nHIND, FRANK, timber dealer, Belvedere, &c.—The public examination of this debtor was called on again at the Rochester Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Smith, on Monday, and further adjourned to the 13th November. The trustee (Mr. Edward Allen) is experiencing considerable difficulty in the matter, the accounts are so complicated, and there is an application for the appointment of a committee of inspection. A sale of the debtor’s stock, which was advertised, has for the present been postponed.\n\nHIRST, GEORGE, timber merchant, Walk, Walton Street, Hull, formerly carrying on business at Madeley Street.—This bankrupt appeared for his public examination on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Rollit, at the Hull Bankruptcy Court. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed liabilities amounting to £2,843 5s. 6d., with assets estimated to produce £909 7s. 7d., thus showing a deficiency of £1,933 17s. 1d. In reply to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor said he commenced business about six years ago, being in partnership with his brother. In 1894 his brother went out of the business, receiving £300. The turnover averaged £4,000 a year, but the gross profit had only amounted to 3 per cent. The expenses of the Madeley Street mill were very great, and he had not been in very good health for some years. The “stuff” that came from the mill had been sifted and turned over, and he had been taken at a disadvantage. The cause of failure was want of capital, enabling him to buy at the proper seasons. He had suffered very much from machinery breakdowns. Honestly speaking, the place was too big for him. He had only drawn £2 a week for the maintenance of a family of six. His wife had assisted with the profits derived from poultry keeping. He did not know he was insolvent until 12 months ago. He became insolvent three years ago.—Mr. Laverack (for the creditors): He had always had the control of the site. A gentleman who was connected with it now had said the site was a gold mine. —The Registrar: A gold mine which requires a good deal of gold putting in it.—The examination was closed.\n\nHUTCHINGS, CHARLES ALI, builder, Winchester.—The public examination of the above-named debtor took place on the last sitting of the Winchester County Court. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed liabilities amounting to £1,217 19s. 1d., and a deficiency of £726. Debtor attributed his failure to have been caused through want of capital, and illness in his family. The greatest loss was in respect of a contract for alterations to the judge’s lodging at Winchester. The contract price was £2,500, but it cost him nearly £3,000. The examination was eventually ordered to be closed.\n\nJILLINGS, JAMES, builder and joiner, Garden Street, Cromer.—The public examination of the above-named debtor took place at the last sitting of the Norwich Bankruptcy Court. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed gross liabilities amounting to £2,395 14s. 4d., of which £639 7s. 6d.\n\nTHE “EAGLE”\nDOORS, WINDOWS\nARCHITEC\nThe Largest and\nTELEGRAMS—“MOULDINGS, PLY”\nWrite for new Illustrat\nJOINERY SEN",
