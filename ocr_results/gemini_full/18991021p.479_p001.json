Wright, builders, of John Street, Crewe. When discovered, the flames had secured a firm hold of the joiners' shop, saw-mills and offices, and a huge timber stack. The fire practically burnt itself out, and some very valuable timber and a quantity of joiners' tools were destroyed. The damage is estimated at £1,000.\n\n—:o:—\n\nACCIDENTS.\nWilliam Lake, aged 25, employed at Elliott's saw-mills, Stonehouse Bridge, Plymouth, was working at a planing machine on Thursday last week, when four fingers of his left hand were severed, and were afterwards amputated at the South Devon Hospital, Devonport.\nWilliam Jones, sawyer, employed by Mr. Price, contractor of the new Crowhurst, Sidley and Bexhill Railway, was killed while working at the saw-mills. A piece of waste wood being thrown from the machine and striking him on the head was the cause. At an inquest on the body gave the above verdict.\n\nWOOD PAVING.\nThe L.C.C. on Tuesday granted a loan to the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, of £10,000 for wood-paving works in Berkley Street, Charles Street, Chesham Street, Chesham Place, Commercial Road, Eaton Terrace, Eaton Square, Mill Street, and Upper Grosvenor Street. The Vestry propose to lay deal wood paving in these thoroughfares.\nA loan of £12,440 was sanctioned to the St. George the Martyr (Southwark) Vestry for wood and asphalte paving works; and a loan of £17,250 was granted to the St. Pancras Vestry, authorising them to pave Euston Road, Hampstead Road, Litchford Street, and Midland Road, with deal wood.\nA proposal is before the Lambeth Vestry to pave with wood Lambeth Walk, part of Coldharbour Lane, Old Paradise Street, and Stockwell Road. The paving of Stockwell Road and South Lambeth Road with wood is also suggested.\n\n—:o:—\n\nTwo men were fined 10s. and costs each, at Barnsley Police Court, for stealing 10s. worth of timber from Walter Scott & Co., the contractors for the widening of the Midland Railway between Wath and Cudworth.\n\n* * *\n\nTo new users of the Zebra Code :—\n\nTELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS.\nBartörn, Sundsvall\nFarrin, Cincinnati\nHansen, Porsgrund\nHartman, Helsingfors\nHolmgrenus Stockholm\nKramfors, Sweden\n\nKrakvaag, Tvedestrand\nKebel, Stockholm\nSiren, Helsingfors\nTaccone, Genova\n\nThe above are firms already using the code.\n\nTELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS\nGravel, Etchemin\n\nExterieur, Paris\nDekker, Zaandam\nHonig, Purmerend\nNeilsen, Amsterdam\nBushmakoff, Onega\n\nA copy of this Journal, Pocket Edition, 1s., will be sent free on application.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL 479\n\nSCOTCH SECTION.\n\nSINGLETON, DUNN & CO.,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n27, UNION STREET, GLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"SINGLETONS, GLASGOW.\"\n\nEDMISTON & MITCHELLS,\nTIMBER BROKERS,\n33, Renfield Street, GLASGOW.\n\nTHOMSON & GRAY,\nTEAK IMPORTERS,\n44, WEST GEORGE STREET,\nGLASGOW.\nTelegraphic Address—\"TEAK, GLASGOW.\"\n\nA. & G.

There are no auction sales to report, and no intimations of any have been made at present, a good business, however, is being done privately.\nPrices continue to firm up in both spruce and pine deals, and sellers, in view of the limited stock and the advance in values in Canada, are not inclined to push sales unduly. Deliveries are well maintained.\nThe import to Glasgow this week amounts to 11,700 loads, to Greenock 4,600 loads, and to Grangemouth 4,750 loads.\n\nLEITH.\nThe arrivals of wood during the past week have been unimportant, comprising some parcels of rickers, lathwood, deals and battens by the regular steamers from St. Petersburg, Riga and Montreal, and a sailer cargo of battens from Bollsta.\nFavoured with fine weather for all out-door work the deliveries of wood continue fairly large, and, were it not for the check given by the great advance in cost, deliveries would no doubt be still larger. Besides the increased cost free-on-board, there is a serious rise in freight and insurance rates also to reckon with. There has been no public sale for some weeks, but one is announced by D. W Beattie for Tuesday, 24th inst.\n\n—o—\n\nMessrs.
