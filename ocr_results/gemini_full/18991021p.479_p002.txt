LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
THE DISCHARGING OF A VESSEL'S CARGO.
In Dundee Small Debt Court on Tuesday, Sheriff Campbell Smith on the bench, the Leith, Hull and Hamburg Steam Packet Com-pany, Ltd., Leith, sued John M'Tavish, joiner, Perth Road, Dundee, for £4 1s. 4d., being the usual proportion of the cost of discharging 108 standards of firewood at 9d. per standard, alleged to be due by the defender to the pur-suers. David Alexander, senior partner of the firm of David Alexander & Sons, Dundee, the local representative of the pursuers, said that the "Nevada" (s) arrived at Dundee in July last with a cargo of wood for the defender. His stevedores put the wood on the quay, and no charge was made against defender for this, but in order to allow continuous discharging to go on they had to lift the wood from the side of the ship and put it in a shed, and it was for doing so that the 9d. was charged. He always made this charge against his con-signees. Cross-examined, he said he could not tell whether the wood was lifted after it had been taken out of the ship.—David Sturrock, stevedore, Park Avenue, Dundee, said he got 2s. 9d. per standard for discharging the wood. To his knowledge none of it was split or des-troyed in any way in the discharging.—John M'Tavish said he had never paid for discharg-ing wood before, although he had paid for having it piled. He estimated the damage done to the wood owing to the careless fashion in which it had been discharged at £9, and he had lodged a counter-claim for that sum.—Mr. J. Pettersen, Swedish Consul at Dundee, said it was usual to pay accounts of the nature of the one now sued for only when the wood was piled on the quay. In the case of firewood, it was not usual to pay anything for discharg-ing. After further evidence, the Sheriff said it was his opinion in point of law that the ship was bound to discharge the cargo, and that it was bound to discharge it in a safe place. If a safe place was not to be found conveniently and moderately near the ship, it might be necessary to send the cargo away some distance or put it in a warehouse. In this case it was simply a part of the cost of discharging, and he therefore disallowed the claim. As to the counter-claim, a ship discharging firewood was not bound to take any special care of it, and he therefore dismissed the counter-claim. Agents—For pursuer, Mr. John Thomson; for defender, Mr. James Allison.

THE PURCHASE OF ROXBURGH SUGAR REFINERY.
A company has now been registered, under the title of Roxburgh Street Sugar Refinery Company (Limited), to take over the Roxburgh Street Sugar Re-finery, with the stores and other assets. The subscribers to the memorandum and articles of association are:—James Agnew, joiner and builder, Greenock; John Allison, brick-builder, Greenock; J. W. Bailey, sugar re-finer, Greenock; Matthew Blake, sugar re-finer, Greenock; John Drummond, cooper, Green-ock; John Leckie, coppersmith, Greenock; and R. S. Murray, writer, Greenock. The capital of the company is £50,000, divided into shares of £10 each. The directors of the company are:—Messrs. Agnew, Allison, Drummond, and Leckie; and Bailey, Blake, Fyfe & Murray, writers. The secretaries, Fyfe & Murray. The properties and other assets of the refinery company have now been acquired by the new company, and the price paid.
—:o:—
PORTION OF BUILDINGS TO BE DISMANTLED.
We understand that a meeting of the direc-tors of the above company was held on the 6th inst., in the office of the secretaries—Fyfe & Murray, writers, when, after full considera-tion, and looking to the present sugar bounty question, that it was resolved in the interests of the com-pany to commence sugar refining or to hold over the matter in the hope that some settlement of the bounty question might be made within a short time. In these circum-stances it was decided to proceed with the dismantling of the buildings on an early date. While a portion of the ground which is at present unoccupied may be utilized for build-ing purposes, we believe that it is not the in-tention of the directors to raze the whole of the refinery portion of the buildings until it is decided whether they cannot be developed for some other purpose.
