The statement of affairs filed\nby the debtor showed gross liabilities amount-\ning to £3,312, of which £1,260 is due to un-\nsecured creditors, the liabilities expected to\nrank for dividend amounting to £1,260.\nThe assets, consisting of surplus from securi-\nties in hands of creditors fully secured, were\nreturned at £300, from which £2 had to be\ndeducted for the claims of preferential credi-\ntors, leaving net assets, amounting to £293,\nand a deficiency of £962. The report and ob-\nservations of the Official Receiver were to the\nfollowing effect:—The receiving order was\nmade upon the petition of Nurman & Sons, of\n20 and 21, Gracechurch Street, E.C., timber\nmerchants. Debtor attributes his insolvency\nto losses on buildings and law costs. The\nestate was left in the hands of the Official\nReceiver for summary administration.\nBARTON & SON, E. H., timber merchants,\n57, Gracechurch Street, E.C.—The bankrupts\nfiled their petition in April last, and they ap-\nplied on Wednesday to Mr. Registrar Giffard\nfor their discharge. The joint liabilities were\nreturned at £12,848 0s. 7d., exclusive of any\namount that might be proved for damages in\nrespect of the non-fulfilment of current con-\ntracts. Proofs have been made for £14,202\n3s. 1d., and further proofs for about £500 are\nlikely to be lodged. The assets, which were\nestimated at £11,002 3s. 5d., have realized\n£7,154 14s. 7d., and £2,753 4s. 2d. further is\nexpected to be received. There were no\nseparate liabilities or assets. It appeared from\nthe Official Receiver's report and the state-\nments of E. H. Barton, senr., that he had pre-\nviously failed in 1873 when, after having\ntraded as a packing-case maker in partnership\nwith his father and brother, he (with his part-\nners) was adjudged bankrupt. A dividend of\n5s. 6d. in the £ was paid on joint liabilities\nof £3,027, and the bankrupt obtained his dis-\ncharge in 1874. After this failure the debtor\nwas for some time in employment as traveller\nfor a firm of timber merchants, but in 1887 he,\nwith about £400 capital, commenced a similar\nbusiness on his own account, which for a time\nwas conducted from his residence. In 1891\nhe took an office at 57, Gracechurch Street,\nand in April, 1896, he took his son into part-\nnership, the business being then conducted as\nE. H. Barton & Son. The senior bankrupt's\ncapital was estimated at £1,800, of which\n£300 was his own, when the partnership was formed, and £300 was\ncredited to the capital account of E. H. Bar-\nton, junr. The bankrupts attributed their\nfailure mainly to bad debts (about £3,500 dur-\ning the three years preceding the receiving\norder) and to losses on trading, caused partly\nby the fall in 1897 in the price of spruce, of\nwhich they held a large stock. It appeared,\nhowever, from the investigations of the Official\nReceiver that one of the main reasons of the\nfailure was the fact that the bankrupts, en-\ncouraged by a profit of upwards of £1,400\nmade in 1896, in the two following years made\npurchases of timber to an extent beyond what\ntheir capital justified, with the result that\nwhen a fall in prices occurred they were un-\nable to fulfil their engagements. The pur-\nchases of timber made by the firm amounted\nin 1896 to £53,735; in 1897 to £91,225; and\nin 1898 to £88,353. The bankrupts alleged\n\nthat they became aware of their insolvency\nonly two or three days prior to the receiving order.\nAnnual statements were prepared, the more\nrecent ones showing—December 31, 1895,\nsurplus £815; December 31, 1896, surplus\n£2,289; December 31, 1897, surplus £1,251.\nThe only offence reported was that the senior\nbankrupt had previously failed in 1873. Mr.\nE. S. Grey attended as Assistant Receiver,\nand said it was only fair to the bankrupts to\nstate that immediately they found themselves\nin difficulties they filed their petition, and\nbrought in a very substantial estate. Mr.\nClayton, who appeared for the bankrupts,\nsaid that immediately the bankrupts were im-\nported to a very substantial estate. He\nregarded it as only fair to the bank-\nrupts to state that immediately they found\nthemselves in difficulties they filed their peti-\ntion, and brought in a very substantial estate.\nMr. Clayton, who appeared for the bankrupts,\nsaid that immediately the bankrupts were im-\nported to a very substantial estate. He\nregarded it as only fair to the bankrupts to\nstate that immediately they found themselves\nin difficulties they filed their petition, and\nbrought in a very substantial estate. Mr.\nBarton, junr., was entitled to his immediate\ndischarge, as no offence was reported to have\nbeen committed by him. With regard to the\nsenior bankrupt, the only matter against him\nwas that he had previously failed about 26 years\nago. He did not go into business again for about\n13 years, and it now appeared that there were\nassets amounting to nearly £10,000. He under-\nstood that 7s. in the £ had already been paid,\nand that a further dividend of 3s. would\nshortly be declared. What he suggested was\nthat there should be a nominal suspension until\nthe 10s. in the £ had been paid, as it was in\nall respects an honest case, and the Senior\nOfficial Receiver had at the first meeting ex-\npressed his regret that the matter had to go\ninto bankruptcy, as the bankrupts had filed\ntheir petition without delay with a view to the\nprotection of the estate. His Honour assented\nto this course, and imposed a nominal suspen-\nsion as suggested in the case of E. H. Barton,\nsenr., an immediate discharge being granted\nto the junior bankrupt.\nBISHOP, GEORGE, etc., Birling,\nKent.—At the Sessions House, Maidstone, this\ndebtor appeared for his public examination on\nWednesday, with gross liabilities scheduled at\n£810 19s. and the assets some £50 odd.\nDeficiency £789 14s. 10d. Debtor was examined\nby the Deputy Official Receiver (Mr. R. W.\nCane). Mr. H. White appearing as debtor's\nsolicitor. The evidence was that debtor had\nformerly been in business with two brothers,\nbut with no definite partnership arrangements.\nHe stated that he had lost money on\nseveral contracts, principally through increase\nof wages and prices of material. His creditors\nincluded Messrs. Renton, of 110, Cannon Street, timber\nmerchants (they being the largest creditors) over\n£200. The Official Receiver took the debtor\nthrough the several contracts. He has shown\nlosses of over £700 on these affairs. Not having\nkept proper books, debtor really did not know\nhow he stood financially. His ledger only\nshows what was owing to him, not what he owed\nthe debtors. He states that he was only\naware of his insolvency last May. The debtor's\nexamination was closed, subject to signing\nnotes.\nCLARKE, GEORGE HENRY, builder,\nSpringbank Road, Ilither Green, Kent.—In\nthis recent failure the gross liabilities amount to\n£3,485 10s. 8s., of which £2,158 17s. 6d. is expected\nto rank for dividend, and assets £715 6s.,\ndeficiency £1,442 11s. 6d.

The productive value of the assets\nwas, however, largely over estimated, the even-\ntual sum realised in respect of the estate being\n£4,442 7s. 2d., out of which a dividend of\n2s. 6d. in the £ was paid. The bankrupts\nattributed their failure to bad debts, to losses\non contracts, and to depreciation in the value\nof the stock. The Official Receiver reported\nthat the bankrupts had omitted to keep proper\nbooks of account, and had continued to trade\nafter knowing themselves to be insolvent. The\nbankrupts had also contributed to their failure\nby rash and hazardous speculations.
