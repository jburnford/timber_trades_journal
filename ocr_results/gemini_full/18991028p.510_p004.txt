FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases
creditors whose names are published in these
lists hold security for their debts, sometimes
for the full amount.]
BANEY, GEORGE EDWARD, builder, 14
Addison Road, Walthamstow, lately residing
at Ilford Hill, Ilford.—The first meeting of
the creditors interested under this failure took
place on Tuesday, at the offices of the Official
Receiver, Temple Chambers, Temple Avenue,
London, E.C. The statement of affairs filed
by the debtor showed gross liabilities amount-
ing to £3,312, of which £1,260 is due to un-
secured creditors, the liabilities expected to
rank for dividend amounting to £1,260.
The assets, consisting of surplus from securi-
ties in hands of creditors fully secured, were
returned at £300, from which £2 had to be
deducted for the claims of preferential credi-
tors, leaving net assets, amounting to £293,
and a deficiency of £962. The report and ob-
servations of the Official Receiver were to the
following effect:—The receiving order was
made upon the petition of Nurman & Sons, of
20 and 21, Gracechurch Street, E.C., timber
merchants. Debtor attributes his insolvency
to losses on buildings and law costs. The
estate was left in the hands of the Official
Receiver for summary administration.
BARTON & SON, E. H., timber merchants,
57, Gracechurch Street, E.C.—The bankrupts
filed their petition in April last, and they ap-
plied on Wednesday to Mr. Registrar Giffard
for their discharge. The joint liabilities were
returned at £12,848 0s. 7d., exclusive of any
amount that might be proved for damages in
respect of the non-fulfilment of current con-
tracts. Proofs have been made for £14,202
3s. 1d., and further proofs for about £500 are
likely to be lodged. The assets, which were
estimated at £11,002 3s. 5d., have realized
£7,154 14s. 7d., and £2,753 4s. 2d. further is
expected to be received. There were no
separate liabilities or assets. It appeared from
the Official Receiver's report and the state-
ments of E. H. Barton, senr., that he had pre-
viously failed in 1873 when, after having
traded as a packing-case maker in partnership
with his father and brother, he (with his part-
ners) was adjudged bankrupt. A dividend of
5s. 6d. in the £ was paid on joint liabilities
of £3,027, and the bankrupt obtained his dis-
charge in 1874. After this failure the debtor
was for some time in employment as traveller
for a firm of timber merchants, but in 1887 he,
with about £400 capital, commenced a similar
business on his own account, which for a time
was conducted from his residence. In 1891
he took an office at 57, Gracechurch Street,
and in April, 1896, he took his son into part-
nership, the business being then conducted as
E. H. Barton & Son. The senior bankrupt's
capital was estimated at £1,800, of which
£300 was his own, when the partnership was formed, and £300 was
credited to the capital account of E. H. Bar-
ton, junr. The bankrupts attributed their
failure mainly to bad debts (about £3,500 dur-
ing the three years preceding the receiving
order) and to losses on trading, caused partly
by the fall in 1897 in the price of spruce, of
which they held a large stock. It appeared,
however, from the investigations of the Official
Receiver that one of the main reasons of the
failure was the fact that the bankrupts, en-
couraged by a profit of upwards of £1,400
made in 1896, in the two following years made
purchases of timber to an extent beyond what
their capital justified, with the result that
when a fall in prices occurred they were un-
able to fulfil their engagements. The pur-
chases of timber made by the firm amounted
in 1896 to £53,735; in 1897 to £91,225; and
in 1898 to £88,353. The bankrupts alleged

that they became aware of their insolvency
only two or three days prior to the receiving order.
Annual statements were prepared, the more
recent ones showing—December 31, 1895,
surplus £815; December 31, 1896, surplus
£2,289; December 31, 1897, surplus £1,251.
The only offence reported was that the senior
bankrupt had previously failed in 1873. Mr.
E. S. Grey attended as Assistant Receiver,
and said it was only fair to the bankrupts to
state that immediately they found themselves
in difficulties they filed their petition, and
brought in a very substantial estate. Mr.
Clayton, who appeared for the bankrupts,
said that immediately the bankrupts were im-
ported to a very substantial estate. He
regarded it as only fair to the bank-
rupts to state that immediately they found
themselves in difficulties they filed their peti-
tion, and brought in a very substantial estate.

ported to a very substantial estate. He

Barton, junr., was entitled to his immediate
discharge, as no offence was reported to have
been committed by him. With regard to the
senior bankrupt, the only matter against him
was that he had previously failed about 26 years
ago. He did not go into business again for about
13 years, and it now appeared that there were
assets amounting to nearly £10,000. He under-
stood that 7s. in the £ had already been paid,
and that a further dividend of 3s. would
shortly be declared. What he suggested was
that there should be a nominal suspension until
the 10s. in the £ had been paid, as it was in
all respects an honest case, and the Senior
Official Receiver had at the first meeting ex-
pressed his regret that the matter had to go
into bankruptcy, as the bankrupts had filed
their petition without delay with a view to the
protection of the estate. His Honour assented
to this course, and imposed a nominal suspen-
sion as suggested in the case of E. H. Barton,
senr., an immediate discharge being granted
to the junior bankrupt.
BISHOP, GEORGE, etc., Birling,
Kent.—At the Sessions House, Maidstone, this
debtor appeared for his public examination on
Wednesday, with gross liabilities scheduled at
£810 19s. and the assets some £50 odd.
Deficiency £789 14s. 10d. Debtor was examined
by the Deputy Official Receiver (Mr. R. W.
Cane). Mr. H. White appearing as debtor's
solicitor. The evidence was that debtor had
formerly been in business with two brothers,
but with no definite partnership arrangements.
He stated that he had lost money on
several contracts, principally through increase
of wages and prices of material. His creditors
included Messrs. Renton, of 110, Cannon Street, timber
merchants (they being the largest creditors) over
£200. The Official Receiver took the debtor
through the several contracts. He has shown
losses of over £700 on these affairs. Not having
kept proper books, debtor really did not know
how he stood financially. His ledger only
shows what was owing to him, not what he owed
the debtors. He states that he was only
aware of his insolvency last May. The debtor's
examination was closed, subject to signing
notes.
CLARKE, GEORGE HENRY, builder,
Springbank Road, Ilither Green, Kent.—In
this recent failure the gross liabilities amount to
£3,485 10s. 8s., of which £2,158 17s. 6d. is expected
to rank for dividend, and assets £715 6s.,
deficiency £1,442 11s. 6d. The following are

Kentish Town Wharf, N.W.—The bankrupts
filed their petition in March, 1893, and on
Thursday application was made by F. Grover
to Mr. Registrar Hope for an order of dis-
charge. The liabilities were returned at
£15,797 18s. 3d., and the assets at £25,203
10s. 10d. The productive value of the assets
was, however, largely over estimated, the even-
tual sum realised in respect of the estate being
£4,442 7s. 2d., out of which a dividend of
2s. 6d. in the £ was paid. The bankrupts
attributed their failure to bad debts, to losses
on contracts, and to depreciation in the value
of the stock. The Official Receiver reported
that the bankrupts had omitted to keep proper
books of account, and had continued to trade
after knowing themselves to be insolvent. The
bankrupts had also contributed to their failure
by rash and hazardous speculations. The
learned Registrar suspended the discharge for
three years.

filed their petition in March, 1893, and on
Thursday application was made by F. Grover
to Mr. Registrar Hope for an order of dis-
charge. The liabilities were returned at
£15,797 18s. 3d., and the assets at £25,203
10s. 10d. The productive value of the assets
was, however, largely over estimated, the even-
tual sum realised in respect of the estate being
£4,442 7s. 2d., out of which a dividend of
2s. 6d. in the £ was paid. The bankrupts
attributed their failure to bad debts, to losses
on contracts, and to depreciation in the value
of the stock. The Official Receiver reported
that the bankrupts had omitted to keep proper
books of account, and had continued to trade
after knowing themselves to be insolvent. The
bankrupts had also contributed to their failure
by rash and hazardous speculations. The
learned Registrar suspended the discharge for
three years.

Grover, W. & F., timber merchants,
Kentish Town Wharf, N.W.—The bankrupts
filed their petition in March, 1893, and on
Thursday application was made by F. Grover
to Mr. Registrar Hope for an order of dis-
charge. The liabilities were returned at
£15,797 18s. 3d., and the assets at £25,203
10s. 10d. The productive value of the assets
was, however, largely over estimated, the even-
tual sum realised in respect of the estate being
£4,442 7s. 2d., out of which a dividend of
2s. 6d. in the £ was paid. The bankrupts
attributed their failure to bad debts, to losses
on contracts, and to depreciation in the value
of the stock. The Official Receiver reported
that the bankrupts had omitted to keep proper
books of account, and had continued to trade
after knowing themselves to be insolvent. The
bankrupts had also contributed to their failure
by rash and hazardous speculations. The
learned Registrar suspended the discharge for

charge. The liabilities were returned at
£15,797 18s. 3d., and the assets at £25,203
10s. 10d. The productive value of the assets
was, however, largely over estimated, the even-
tual sum realised in respect of the estate being
£4,442 7s. 2d., out of which a dividend of
2s. 6d. in the £ was paid. The bankrupts
attributed their failure to bad debts, to losses
on contracts, and to depreciation in the value
of the stock. The Official Receiver reported
that the bankrupts had omitted to keep proper
books of account, and had continued to trade
after knowing themselves to be insolvent. The
bankrupts had also contributed to their failure
by rash and hazardous speculations. The
learned Registrar suspended the discharge for
three years.

filed their petition in March, 1893, and on
Thursday application was made by F. Grover
to Mr. Registrar Hope for an order of dis-
charge. The liabilities were returned at
£15,797 18s. 3d., and the assets at £25,203
10s. 10d. The productive value of the assets
was, however, largely over estimated, the even-
tual sum realised in respect of the estate being
£4,442 7s. 2d., out of which a dividend of
2s. 6d. in the £ was paid. The bankrupts
attributed their failure to bad debts, to losses
on contracts, and to depreciation in the value
of the stock. The Official Receiver reported
that the bankrupts had omitted to keep proper
books of account, and had continued to trade
after knowing themselves to be insolvent. The
bankrupts had also contributed to their failure
by rash and hazardous speculations. The
learned Registrar suspended the discharge for
three years.
The following are the timber trade creditors:—
