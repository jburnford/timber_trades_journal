For what was sold fair prices were got, but it was chiefly confined to batten and scantling sizes, the deal sizes being held above buyers' ideas of value.\n—: o :—\n\nIMPORTS.\n\nABERDEEN.\nOct. 17 Maitlands (s)-Cronstadt-1,564 lds. deals, battens and boards-John Fleming & Co., Ltd.\n20 Victor-Sundswall-1,045 lds. sawn fir-Wm.

The pursuer concluded for payment of £1,000, or alternatively of £266 4s. in name of damages for the death of his son. The deceased was in the employment of the defenders, and on 9th June, 1899, was working a circular saw in their workshop when he was struck on the forehead by a piece of wood. He died within four hours of the accident. The pursuer avers that the machinery at which the deceased was working was in a defective condition in respect that the saw was not fenced. The defenders, who state that the deceased contributed to his father's upkeep to the extent of £20 per annum, say they have been all along willing to pay the pursuer reasonable compensation in respect of the death of his son, and they offer the sum of £150 and expenses to the date of tender, which they state is reasonable in the circumstances.\n—: o :—\nOn Wednesday Sheriff Campbell Smith issued an interlocutor in an action at the instance of David Ogilvie, ship carpenter, Dundee, against the Dundee Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., for 19s. a week, being half of his wages. The action was brought under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and the pursuer's case was that while employed as a sawyer in the defenders' works he had the forefinger of his left hand cut off. The Sheriff granted decree for the half-wages until further orders of Court, allowing £4 4s. of expenses.\n—: o :—\n\nSERIOUS SAW MILL ACCIDENT.\nA serious breakdown occurred last week in the Aberdeen Sawmills, belonging to Geo. Gordon & Co. The crank pin of the engine having given way, the piston was driven right through the end of the cylinder, the bed-plate was broken, and other damage was done. The works' manager and the engineer had a narrow escape of being scalded by the steam. The total damage, which is not covered by insurance, is estimated at about £800.\n—: o :—\n\nSOUTH AFRICAN DISTRESS FUND.—Mr. James Tannah has subscribed two guineas, and Mr. D. W.
