There was free buying on the part of consumers at the sale held by D. W. Beattie on the 24th inst., at the Edinburgh Dock, a difficulty was experienced in getting buyers up to the new level, and a good deal more business would have been done had that not been the case. For what was sold fair prices were got, but it was chiefly confined to batten and scantling sizes, the deal sizes being held above buyers' ideas of value.

WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION CASE.
In the Glasgow Court of Session, on Friday last, before the Lord President and Lords Adam, M'Laren, and Kinnear, issues were ordered for jury trial by the First Division in an action at the instance of Marion, storekeeper, 66, High Street, Inverurie, against Daniel Macandrew & Company, builders and contractors, 120, Loch Street, Aberdeen. The pursuer concluded for payment of £1,000, or alternatively of £266 4s. in name of damages for the death of his son. The deceased was in the employment of the defenders, and on 9th June, 1899, was working a circular saw in their workshop when he was struck on the forehead by a piece of wood. He died within four hours of the accident. The pursuer avers that the machinery at which the deceased was working was in a defective condition in respect that the saw was not fenced. The defenders, who state that the deceased contributed to his father's upkeep to the extent of £20 per annum, say they have been all along willing to pay the pursuer reasonable compensation in respect of the death of his son, and they offer the sum of £150 and expenses to the date of tender, which they state is reasonable in the circumstances.

On Wednesday Sheriff Campbell Smith issued an interlocutor in an action at the instance of David Ogilvie, ship carpenter, Dundee, against the Dundee Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., for 19s. a week, being half of his wages. The action was brought under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and the pursuer's case was that while employed as a sawyer in the defenders' works he had the forefinger of his left hand cut off. The Sheriff granted decree for the half-wages until further orders of Court, allowing £4 4s. of expenses.

SERIOUS SAW MILL ACCIDENT.
A serious breakdown occurred last week in the Aberdeen Sawmills, belonging to Geo. Gordon & Co. The crank pin of the engine having given way, the piston was driven right through the end of the cylinder, the bed-plate was broken, and other damage was done. The works' manager and the engineer had a narrow escape of being scalded by the steam. The total damage, which is not covered by insurance, is estimated at about £800.
