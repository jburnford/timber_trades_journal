The statement of affairs showed that £1,380 1s 7d. was expected to rank for dividend, the assets being £1,087 15s. 10d. Debtor attributed his insolvency to having to take over the estate of his son's five years ago, after having paid a composition for it. He did not know how long he had been insolvent, but if the properties he had been engaged upon has realised anything like what they were worth, he would never have been insolvent at all.—The examination was concluded.\n\nEDWARDS, EVAN LLOYD, AND EDWARDS, RICHARD LLOYD, builders, late of Wavertree, now residing at Carnarvon.—The public examination of Evan had been closed, but Richard was then reported to be unable to attend through sickness. A similar report was made at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week.—The Registrar then adjourned Richard's examination for a fortnight, but stated that the next time, if the debtor did not appear, he should require a doctor's certificate and an affidavit.\n\nFREER, WILLIAM BRIMBLECOMBE, builder, 28, Craven Avenue, Plymouth, Devon.—The statement of affairs filed herein discloses liabilities £1,834 17s. 6d., of which £893 is expected to rank for dividend, and assets £393. The debtor alleges as the cause of his failure—\"illness, want of capital, and pressure by creditors.\" The following are trade creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nFox, Eliott & Co., Plymouth .. .. 4 4 4\nHarris & Penn, Plymouth .. .. 98 4 9\nHawken & Son, Plymouth .. .. 17 19 7\nJewson & Son Bros., Plymouth .. 30 11 11\nAt the first meeting of creditors held on Monday at Plymouth, debtor said that Messrs. Wilson Bros., Bristol, and the Queen Anne's Bounty\n\nWES[?]\nKA[?]\n[?]tory Co., timber merchants, had supplied him, and he paid them by cheque. The St. Ann's Battery Co. acted as his agents. He paid them £20, which they returned to him, and they then promised to pay him at the end of the week to pay the men. Instead of doing that, however, they sent for him on the next day, and his wife had to go and pay £32 for £25. His son had worked with him as journeymen.\nDebtor denied that he had anything to do with W. B. French & Sons, but he had had something to do with the contract which was in their name. The Official Receiver said debtor had undoubtedly been trading as \"French & Son.\"—Mr. E. M. Jewson (Jewson & Son, timber merchants) said he had lent debtor money.—Debtor said \"French & Son\" was on the billheads, and his wife had signed them. He had done just as creditors complained of.—The Official Receiver: I shall make further inquiries, and ask debtor some questions concerning this at his public examination.—Mr. Jewson asked debtor if he had not told his creditors before June, and when he was not able to pay his accounts on the Saturday, that when they became due on the Monday, sometimes he was behind, and when the money came in he would pay.—Debtor said they were insolvent long before June.—The Registrar: It seems a nice little family arrangement all through.—Debtor's public examination was fixed for the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday next.\n\nGROVER, W. & F., Kentish Town Wharf, N.W.—As reported in our last issue, Mr. Registrar Hope gave his decision on the application made by the bankrupts for an order of discharge. He said he had postponed his decision in order to be further satisfied by the authorities on the question of rash and hazardous speculation whether the bankrupts had committed that offence. The result was that he, with his partner, was satisfied that the examination was passed last year. The liabilities were £21,200 18s. 5d., but proofs had been admitted for £10,600 11s. 5d. The assets were estimated at £10,800 10s. 10d., but they had realised only £1,500 7s. 2d. The difference in the assets was due mainly to the fact that a large portion of £15,200 being realised from the property at Edmonton, a proof for which had been tendered in respect of the balance due to the mortgagees. He reported that the assets were not 2s. 6d. in the £ on the amount of the liabilities; that the debtor had contributed to his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculations, and had made a preferential payment with his creditors. As to the last offence, it was suggested that although less than 10s. in the £ had been paid under the bankruptcy, yet that under a previous arrangement with the creditors he had paid £10,600 in the £, or £10,600 in all. He submitted that if the £10,600 were added to the assets the amount would be more than sufficient to pay 10s. in the £ on the liabilities, and that the Court could deal with the matter in that way the amount of the liabilities in respect of which the £10,600 was paid would have to be computed in the liabilities, in which case the dividend would not be made up. He (the Registrar) was of opinion that he must take the liabilities\n\nR\nThe output for the week ending October 28th, 1899, was\n47,296 superficial feet.\nMILLARS' KARRI AND JARRAH FORESTS, LIMITED.\n72, BISHOPSGATE STREET WITHIN, LONDON, E.C.\nTelegrams: \"Jarrah, London.\"",
