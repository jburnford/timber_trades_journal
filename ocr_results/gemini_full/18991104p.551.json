HARDWOOD, LTD.\nThe settlement has been intimated of an action in which Mr. William Young, timber merchant, late of George Square, Glasgow, and now at Spring Bank, Talbot Road, Manchester, sued Hardwood, Ltd., timber merchants, 13, Exchange Street, Manchester, for payment of £1,100. The defending company was incorporated on 27th May, 1898, and the pursuer was, by the articles of association, appointed one of the first directors of the company. Shortly after the incorporation of the company, he said, he was also appointed chairman and managing director, and the amount claimed was remuneration for services rendered between his appointment and 26th April, 1899, when he was told that his services were not required. The pursuer's averments were denied by the defenders, who said that no demand was ever made upon them for remuneration until this action was served.\n\n\"CALL\" PAYMENT DISPUTE.\nYOUNG V. BENNETTS, LTD.\nThis matter was before Lord Stormonth Darling, at Glasgow. The settlement was intimated of the action which Mr. William Young, timber merchant, formerly of George Square, Glasgow, and now at Spring Bank, Talbot Road, Manchester, raised against Bennetts, Ltd., timber merchants, 13, Exchange Street, Manchester, to recover £10,000 in name of damages. Prior to July, 1897, the pursuer carried on business in Glasgow and elsewhere as an importer of and dealer in oak staves and other timber. The defendants' company was incorporated on 28th July, 1897. One of the objects for which the company was established was to acquire the pursuer's business and stock. It was agreed that the company should pay for the stock at current prices, and that the price should (except as to a sum of £10,000) be paid for in cash, and as to the remainder by allotment to the pursuer or his nominees of 1,000 fully paid-up £10 shares in the company. By agreement, dated 20th October, 1897, the pursuer undertook to surrender his\n\n551\n\n£500 fully paid shares, and the company agreed to allot to the pursuer or his nominees therefore 2,000 ordinary shares, upon which £5 should be deemed to be credited and paid up. According to the pursuer's statement, it was agreed that no calls should be made upon these shares without the pursuer's consent, and his averment was that in contravention of this agreement a call of £5 per share has been made upon him, and in default of payment his shares had been forfeited. The effect of this had been to deprive the pursuer of the whole of the proportion of the price of his business sold to the defenders payable in shares, and he estimated the loss he had thus sustained at £10,000. The defenders said there was no agreement to the effect that no calls were to be made on the pursuer, and that any such agreement would have been illegal.\n\nUNDER WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT.\nAt Greenock Sheriff Court on Monday proof was led before Sheriff Begg in an action raised under the Workmen's Compensation Act by John Keir, labourer, 4, Cottonmill Row, against Brown, Stewart & Co., paper manufactureres, Overton. Pursuer, while in defendant's employment on 23rd March last, got his left arm bruised and his shoulder injured by a paper-making machine, and has since been unable to earn any wages, and states that he will in future be incapable of doing so. Defenders alleged contributory negligence, stating that the pursuer had no right to be under the machine at the time of the accident, and that the injury was therefore not met with during the course of his employment. The Sheriff granted decree for the amount claimed—8s. 6d. per week, beginning on 1st April last—with expenses. Pursuer's wages were nearly 17s. per week.\n\nSheriff Campbell Smith on Wednesday last week issued an interlocator in the action at the instance of David Ogilvie, ship carpenter, Paterson Street, Dundee, against the Dundee Shipbuilding Company, Limited, for 18s. 6d. a week, being the amount of half his wages under the Workmen's Compensation Act. Pursuer was employed as a sawyer in defenders' works, and had the fourth finger of his left hand cut off on 27th January. His Lordship granted decree for half wages until further orders of Court, and allowed £4 4s. expenses.\n\nGAZETTE.\nAt the meeting of creditors of Robert Ritchie, joiner, Baird Street, Coatbridge, held within the Faculty Hall, Mr. Richard M'Culloch, accountant, 69, West Regent Street, Glasgow, was unanimously appointed trustee, and Mr. Thomas Philp, writer, 116, St. Vincent Street, the law agent.\n\nGREENHEART,\nMACLEAN, TODD, & CO.\nGREENOCK.\nTelegraphic Address—\"GREENHEART.\"\n\nA. & W.
