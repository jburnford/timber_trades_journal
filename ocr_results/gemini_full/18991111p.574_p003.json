He commenced business about 10 years ago at Chandos Road, Stratford, with a capital of £300. He had carried on business at Forest Gate, Ilford, and Walthamstow. In February last the Sheriff of Essex took possession of his horses, estimated at £150—at all events that was the price he gave for them—but when put up for auction they only realised £30. The only book of account he had kept was a wages book. It was not true to say that he had not been able to pay 20s. in the pound ever since 1892. He showed that he was perfectly solvent three or four years ago. He had built upwards of 80 houses on the Henderson Estate, Forest Gate. The examination was eventually formally adjourned until the next sitting of the Court.\n\nBOWEN, EVAN, builder, Maesteg.\n—At the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court, before the Official Receiver, Mr. Registrar Cousins, the debtor was examined.\n\nCOLLIER, F.
