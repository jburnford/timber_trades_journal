The debtor stated that he commenced business about 20 years ago at Church Road, Stratford, with a capital of £150. He had had building contracts these last few years. The last contract was for 80 houses on the Forest Gate estate, and that was the principal cause of his failure. He had been unable to pay 20s. in the £ for the last three or four years. He had no books of account that he could produce. He believed that he had kept a wages book, but he did not know what had become of it. He had had no other papers, no invoices, nor had he had any banking account. He had some small pocket-books at home. The Official Receiver asked for an adjournment for the production of these books, and the Registrar granted it.\nHARCOURT AND PLAISTOW, builder, Maeseteg, Glam.—Debtor attended for his public examination at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court on Friday last. The Official Receiver informed Mr. Registrar Cousins that he believed debtor had absconded, and he therefore asked that the public examination be adjourned sine die. The request was acceded to.\nCOLLIER, F. S., builder, White Horse Lane, East Ham. The debtor also carried on business at\n\nA. SUNDQUIST & CO.\nTIMBER AGENTS,\n65 & 56, BISHOPSGATE ST.

Pope, Assistant Receiver. The receiving order was made upon the joint petition of Barclay Bros., timber merchants, Leadenhall Street, E.C., and of Miles & Ginn, Mile End Road, E. A draft statement of affairs was lodged showing liabilities £1818, with estimated assets £460. Proofs of debt were lodged by:—\n£ s. d.\nJ. H.

In January last he (then being without a partner) commenced to erect 24 houses at Harcourt Road, West Ham, but in the following August the freeholders took possession and are now completing them. The debtor had since been employed as manager. He attributed his failure to losses under building agreements and to pressure by creditors. He had made no offer and it was stated that he had been adjudicated. Mr. A. C. Bourner, accountant, Bushlane House, E.C., was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection consisting of Mr. H. G. Harding, Mr. C. Sankey (J. H. Sankey & Son), and Mr. W. C. Todd (Jas. Nicholson & Son). The public examination is appointed for December 6th.\nCOOK, C. A., builder, 59, Edward Road, Walthamstow. At a public sitting held in this case at the London Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard, the examination was ordered to be concluded, the accounts showing total liabilities £6,438, and a deficiency of £577. It appeared from the evidence that the bankrupt had previously failed in 1888, when carrying on business as a speculative builder. In 1891 he resumed building operations, and erected houses at Tunbridge Wells, but being unable to complete in time, the freeholder entered into possession last August, and arranged for the second mortgagee to finish the houses. The bankrupt stated that his failure was entirely due to losses on these speculative building operations.\nDAVIES, EDWIN, builder, Llantwit Major, Glam.—Debtor attended for his public examination at the Cardiff Bankruptcy Court on Friday last. There is an estimated deficiency of £554. Failure was attributed to \"loss on build ing, etc., and not understanding enough of the work, and taking it too cheap.\" Debtor stated he had disclosed all his assets; had kept a banking account, although he could not write and could read only a little. His last contract was for the Llantwit Major Board School's extension, at £889. Had drawn about £880, but the work was not complete. He owed his father £50. He had kept no books of account, and the furniture was claimed by his wife. The examination was closed.\nEVAN, JOHN JAMES, builder, Tyrwith, Maesteg.—Debtor, whose deficiency is estimated at £325, attended for his public examination at Cardiff Bankruptcy Court on Friday last.\nFRENCH, WILLIAM B., builder, Plymouth. —This debtor was publicly examined at the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court on Monday, before Mr. Registrar Bridgman. Debtor stated his wife claimed all the furniture in the house. Besides the furniture, his wife claimed one of the houses in Craven Avenue. The property was conveyed to her in April last, subject to a mortgage of £350. It was worth £450. The house was conveyed to his wife as security for £100 which she advanced to him. The loan was made to him in two sums nine or ten years ago, and the money was a gift to his wife from her parents. At the time it was arranged that the house should be conveyed to her, and 21, Marlborough Road was accordingly conveyed to her. There was a mortgage of £300 on that property. His wife sold the house in the Marlborough Road five years ago for £400. Between that time and the date of the conveyance of the house in Craven Avenue to her, debtor continued to have the use of the loan without security. The Official Receiver said the transaction with regard to the house would require further investigation, and asked that debtor should be ordered to file a goods' and cash account for the twelve months preceding the date of the receiving order. The Registrar ordered the account to be filed, and adjourned the examination for a month.\nGEORGE, C., builder, 42, Church Road, Homerton, N.E.—The debtor filed his own petition on October 26th, and the first meeting of his creditors was held on Tuesday last before Mr. G. W. Chapman, Official Receiver. The accounts showed unsecured debts £242 7s. and no assets, book debts amounting to £58, being treated as bad. The trade creditors are:—\n£ s. d.\nCable & Son, timber merchants, Homerton ... ... ... 11 0 0\nCarter, Alf., timber merchant, Cambridge Heath ... ... ... 30 0 0\nThe debtor states that he commenced business about six years ago at 73, Church Road, Homerton, subsequently removing to 42, Church Road. He had no capital when he started, and he attributed his insolvency to loss on a contract and to a bad debt. He now made no proposal, and it appeared that he had been already adjudged bankrupt. The matter was left in the hands of the Official Receiver as trustee. The public examination is appointed for December 6th.\nGORDON, WILLIAM MAXWELL, timber merchant, Liverpool.—The Official Receiver stated at the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court on Thursday last week, that the examination had been repeatedly adjourned for compliance with an order of the Court for the production of a book and the filing of an account. He stated that the book was still not forthcoming, and the accounts had not been filed. The Registrar adjourned the examination sine die.\n\nSASH & DOOR WORKS.\nSt. Helen's Place, E.C.\nST.
