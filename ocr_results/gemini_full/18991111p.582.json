Mr. Alexander Thomson was very highly respected and esteemed, not merely by all connected with the trade with which he was so long associated, but by the whole community of Edinburgh and Leith, to whom he had given his best services in many public capacities. Great sympathy is being expressed with Lord Provost Mitchell Thomson in the loss he has sustained by the death of his brother and partner.\nMr. Alexander Thomson died on the 5th inst., at his residence, Trinity Grove, Edinburgh. He was born in the year 1843, and was the second son of the late Mr. Andrew Thomson, timber merchant, Alloa. He was educated at the Alloa, and afterwards at the Edinburgh Academy, Raeburn Place.\nHe served the usual mercantile apprenticeship with Maxton, Marshall & Co., Leith. He then joined his father and elder brother, Mr. Andrew Thomson, in the timber business in Alloa, the name of the firm being Andrew Thomson & Sons.\nA few years later, about the year 1868, along with his elder brother, Andrew, and his younger brother, Mr. Mitchell Thomson, the present Lord Provost of the City of Edinburgh, under the style of Mitchell Thomson & Co.\nAt his death he had a seat at the Board of the following public companies, viz., the Clydesdale Bank, the North British Mercantile Insurance Co., the Lothian Coal Co., the Scottish American Mortgage Co., the National Guarantee and Surety Association. Generally he was well-known in business circles in Edinburgh and Leith. His counsel was often sought. It was ungrudgingly given and much valued.\nIn politics he was a Conservative, although taking little public interest in party affairs. He was a member and a liberal supporter of the Scottish Episcopal Church.\nMr. Thomson took a deep interest in the charitable institutions of the City. He was a manager of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and of the Royal Sick Children's Hospital.\nMr. Thomson had long suffered from sciatica, and for the last six weeks he had been confined to the house by a very severe attack. For some days his condition had been exceedingly critical, so much so that the Lord Provost Mitchell Thomson, who was in London on business, was telegraphed for, and travelled north on Saturday night, the 3rd inst. The sad news reached the City Chambers while the members of the Corporation were leaving there after having attended divine services in St. Giles's Cathedral.\nMr. Thomson is survived by a widow, a son (who is at Oxford), and three daughters. His well-known presence will be missed by many who were accustomed to have business and social intercourse with him.\n---\nWe notice that Lord Provost Mitchell Thomson has subscribed a further sum to the Transvaal Fund, viz., £25 to the Relief of Wives and Children of Reservists, and £25 to the Widow and Orphans' Fund. Wm. Beattie & Sons, of Fountain Bridge, have subscribed £2 2s. to the latter Fund.\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nNov. 3 Moidart-Riga-298 lds. battens-R.

The fire broke out in the joiner's shop, and within a few minutes of the discovery of the outbreak huge tongues of flames were bursting out from various parts of the roof. As the huge support stocks used for the building of ships began to take fire, the work of the firemen was all the more dangerous, the flames being kept over the stocks and spreading everywhere. It was easily seen that the brigades would be unable to stop the course of the fire, which, while it destroyed the shipbuilding yard, threatened also to envelop the buildings in the vicinity, and with the view of preventing it reaching these, the firemen worked with a will to stop the outbreak, great volumes of water being poured upon the burning material. An hour after the discovery of the outbreak, the blackened walls were the only relics left of the western structure. The total damage is estimated at about £20,000, and it is reported that the loss is covered by insurance.\nGREENOCK SLATERS' DISPUTE.\nThe strike among Greenock slaters still continues, and over fifty men are idle. No further information has been received from the Masters' Association regarding the demand for an increase of 1/2d. per hour. The men are confident of success, as they anticipate that their numbers will be increased if the request is not granted.\nESTABLISHED 1852. TELEPHONE NO 642.\nA. & J.
