At the first meeting of creditors the debtor said he went into partnership with his brother, and about five years ago they made an arrangement with his creditors for 10s. 8d. in the £. His liabilities were then about £1,500, and his father advanced them some money. He now owed his father about £1,300, for which he, the debtor, was surety. His father, through his solicitor, had threatened to file his petition.—Examination was adjourned to December 7th for the debtor to file accounts and go more closely into the matter.\n\nDEPLODGE, W. T., contractor, Quary Road, Cwmbran, Monmouthshire.—The Official Receiver has issued the summary of the debtor's statement of affairs, which show a deficiency of £1,966 10s. 5d. The causes of failure are given as \"losses on contracts, loss in borrowing money at a high rate of interest, heavy overdraft at bank, and discounts allowed on customers.\"\n\nDAWKINS, ALBERT JAMES, builder, Bar Road, and Cherry Tree Road, Beckenham.—The gross liabilities herein are £9,966 10s. 5d. (unsecured £9,866 10s. 5d.), and the assets estimated to realise £1,966 10s. 5d., thus showing a deficiency of £7,900.

The debtor recently purchased the Royal Hotel, filed his own petition on November 10th, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Thursday before Mr. E. L. Hough, senior Official Receiver. Accounts showed gross liabilities £8,134, and unsecured £2,588, the creditors including the following :—\n£ s. d.\nChaplin, M., Derby .. .. .. 23 8 7\nJones, John, Liverpool .. .. .. 54 3 9\nStenning & Sons .. .. .. .. 37 8 5\nUNSECURED.\nHargreaves, Wm. .. .. .. .. 500 0 0\n(holding 2,500 shares, valued at £625 in the Jarrah Wood Company).\nThe debtor commenced business in November 1899, with £500 borrowed from his father, and since repaid. He had during the last six years been also a director of a number of companies. It was further reported that during the last three years he had lost about £2,000 by speculations on the Stock Exchange, chiefly in Australian Gold Mines. In addition to the creditors given above, proofs of debt were made by the following :—\n£ s. d.\nAnson & Smith .. .. .. .. 21 15 0\nChennel & Armstrong .. .. .. 15 6 0\nDay, Richard .. .. .. .. 1250 0 0\nExecutors of Crowther Alfred (deceased) .. .. .. .. 750 10 0\nLiquidators of the General Railway Syndicate (Ltd) .. .. .. 750 0 0\nWilson, Ben .. .. .. .. 1000 0 0\nThe proceedings resulted in an adjournment till Thursday next, and it was intimated that a trustee would probably be then appointed.\n\nFAULKNER, GEORGE STEPHEN, contractor and builder, Blackborough Road, Reigate.—The statutory meeting of the creditors herein, was held on Friday at the offices of the Board of Trade, 24, Railway Approach, London Bridge, before Mr. A. Mackintosh. The accounts showed liabilities to rank £2,486 0s. 4d., and assets (net) £4,838 6s. Bankrupt was resolved on, and Mr. Gimblette, chartered accountant, New Inn, W.C., was appointed trustee with a Committee of Inspection.\n\nHOWARD, THEOPHILUS, AND WRIGHT, WALTER, Westminster.—An application was made at the Hanley Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, for the discharge of the above-named debtors. The statement of affairs showed liabilities amounting to £9,013, and assets estimated to produce £1,133. The latter, however, having realised only £433, no dividend was paid. Between February, 1896, and June, 1897, bills to the extent of £13,000 or £14,000 were discounted by the debtors. The Official Receiver, in his report, stated that one of the chief causes of the bankruptcy was that the brothers became acquainted with a man named Leon, whose business was to introduce impecunious people to each other, and charge commission for doing so. The acquaintanceship was formed for the purpose of exchanging accommodation bills, and thus changing accommodation bills, and thus \"raising the wind.\" The bankrupts joined three other firms, introduced by Leon, in accommodation bills. These firms having failed, the bankrupts became liable on the whole of the bills, although they had only received one-half of the proceeds.—The Judge said the case reminded him of a custom of the people in the Scilly Islands, who earned a precarious livelihood by taking in each other's washing. (Laughter).—Mr. Pritchett : Or the system of suretyship by which A becomes surety for B on condition that B becomes surety for A. The discharge of the younger brother Walter was granted, subject to judgment for £150, and that of Howard subject to judgment for £400.\n\nPRIDMORE, HARRY LETTS, builder and contractor, 67, Belgrave Road and Ilford Hill, Ilford, Essex.

H. & Co., London .. .. 383 13 7\nSmith, Jonas, London .. .. .. 196 4 1\n\nREYNOLDS, W. P., builder, Lancaster Place, Church Street, Minories.—On Friday last a sitting for public examination was\n\nheld in this case before Mr. Registrar Brougham. It appeared that he had previously failed in 1889, when carrying on business as a builder at 6, Harp Lane, and 46, Great Prescot Street. He afterwards obtained his discharge. He attributed his present failure to losses on contracts, bad debts, law costs, and want of capital. Mr. C. A. Pope attended as assistant official receiver. It was stated that the accounts were not yet completed, and his Honour granted an adjournment until December 15th.\n\nROBERTS, HENRY JOHN, builder, 148, Falcon Road, Battersea, Surrey.—The statement of affairs herein discloses gross liabilities £1,544 11s. 1d, and assets £212. The Official Receiver states that a receiving order was made on the 26th ult., on a creditor's petition, the Act of Bankruptcy being the non-compliance with the requirements of a Bankruptcy notice, duly served upon him on the 27th September last. Debtor states that he commenced business as a builder about 25 years ago, with a capital of £300 to £400 in cash, and that in April last he entered into a building agreement for the erection of nine houses in Gomer Gardens, Teddington, and which he had not quite completed at the date of the receiving order ; that the value of the assets is over-estimated by the debtor ; that the whole of the debtor's proposals are reasonable and calculated to benefit the general body of creditors, assuming that the guarantor carries out the terms of his guarantee.\n\nWOOD, JAS, builder, Ashford.—At this debtor's examination at the Canterbury Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday last week, the Official Receiver said the assets were practically nil. At £1,000 he had had a cash offer of £900, which he advised creditors to accept. The examination was adjourned to the 7th prox.\n\nBANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.\nRECEIVING ORDERS.\nCHATTERTON, SETH EATON, builder, &c., York-rd, South Elmsall, and Hookley, Essex.
