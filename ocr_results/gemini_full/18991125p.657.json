Baikie & Son, timber, lime, and slate merchants, of Kirkwall, who passed away on Sunday last, at the age of 78.\nThe deceased gentleman, who was a native of Kirkwall, began his business career as an apprentice to a local carpenter.\nHaving acquired some practice in architectural drawing, he, in 1851, commenced business for himself as a master builder.\nNine years later he purchased the goodwill and stock-in-trade of the business of the late James Walls, timber merchant.\nIn 1881 he assumed his two sons, William and Samuel, the firm shortly afterwards opening a branch business at Stromness.\nIn 1883 the firm dissolved partnership by mutual consent, Mr. Baikie and his son William taking over the Kirkwall concern, Samuel Baikie, jun., acquiring the branch business at Stromness.\nThe Kirkwall business was then greatly extended, new premises being erected in Castle Street, where more machinery was fitted.\nThe business from that time has always moved onwards, and the credit of the same must in no small measure be attributed to the head of the firm, who has just passed away.\nMr. Baikie, senr., was an Elder, a Freemason, and for many years a member of the Kirkwall Town Council.\n15 Bella—Campbelltown, N.B.—13,380 deals and battens, 6,954 boards, 1,445 deal ends—Edmiston & Mitchells.\nLucas—Cronstadt—11,164 deals and battens—R.
