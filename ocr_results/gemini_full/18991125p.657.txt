LEITH.
There have been more liberal arrivals during the past week, comprising, besides steamer parcels of deals, battens, lathwood, wainscot logs, and oak staves from Riga, and New York, the following sailer cargoes, viz., one of lathwood from Drontheim, and one of deals and battens from Riga, and cargoes of deals and battens from Liscombe, N.S., and Soderhamn, respectively, and a cargo partly loaded at Helsingfors and partly at Narva.
As usual at this season, the volume of business is diminishing, and this tendency was reflected in the public sale held on Tuesday, 21st inst., by Garland & Roger, Ld.
At their railway yard, Edinburgh Dock.
The attendance of buyers was smaller than usual at this firm’s sales, and their requirements seemed easily satisfied as regards quantity, although it was not always possible to reconcile buyers’ and sellers’ ideas of values.
The level of prices, however, was on the whole well maintained for all current sizes of deals and battens.

OBITUARY.
SAMUEL BAIKIE.
It is with regret that we record the death of Mr. Samuel Baikie, senr., head of the firm of S. Baikie & Son, timber, lime, and slate merchants, of Kirkwall, who passed away on Sunday last, at the age of 78.
The deceased gentleman, who was a native of Kirkwall, began his business career as an apprentice to a local carpenter.
Having acquired some practice in architectural drawing, he, in 1851, commenced business for himself as a master builder.
Nine years later he purchased the goodwill and stock-in-trade of the business of the late James Walls, timber merchant.
In 1881 he assumed his two sons, William and Samuel, the firm shortly afterwards opening a branch business at Stromness.
In 1883 the firm dissolved partnership by mutual consent, Mr. Baikie and his son William taking over the Kirkwall concern, Samuel Baikie, jun., acquiring the branch business at Stromness.
The Kirkwall business was then greatly extended, new premises being erected in Castle Street, where more machinery was fitted.
The business from that time has always moved onwards, and the credit of the same must in no small measure be attributed to the head of the firm, who has just passed away.
Mr. Baikie, senr., was an Elder, a Freemason, and for many years a member of the Kirkwall Town Council.
15 Bella—Campbelltown, N.B.—13,380 deals and battens, 6,954 boards, 1,445 deal ends—Edmiston & Mitchells.
