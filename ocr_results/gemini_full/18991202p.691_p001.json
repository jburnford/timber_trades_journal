The \"Winnifred\" has arrived and commenced to discharge at Yorkhill Wharf a full cargo for James Hunter; and the \"Grecian\" has landed 140 standards pine deals, &c., principally for Edmiston & Mittchells. The \"Concordia,\" from Montreal and Three Rivers, has discharged at Yorkhill 350 standards, mostly spruce deals and planks, for Singleton, Dunn & Co., Brownlee & Co., Ltd., and Wm. Shanks & Sons. A considerable portion of these imports are in fulfilment of contracts, and will be delivered ex quay. There is a moderate amount of business going on in pine and spruce deals at the advanced prices now wanted, and the tone of the market continues very firm. Trade in the district generally is active, and sawmillers and others are reported busy. A good business continues to be done in furniture woods coming to hand from the United States, and very little has had to be stored of recent imports. Walnut logs are being imported only to a limited extent, consider-ing the good demand and high prices that have been got for any small parcels ex quay. Oak and whitewood logs are also in request, and mahogany is eagerly enquired for. The \"Hestia,\" from Baltimore, has arrived, and is landing 110 logs whitewood, 105 logs oak, 36 logs walnut, and 54 logs hickory, besides a large quantity of lumber, including 14,000 pcs. oak planks and boards, and about 7,000 whitewood boards.\nThe \"Drumgarth,\" from Newport News, is due here, and is bringing 400 logs ash, 60 logs whitewood, and 120 logs oak, hickory, and gum, besides various lots of whitewood boards and oak planks, and about 100,000 oak staves.\nThe shipbuilding returns for November show that 37,000 tons were launched on the Clyde, as compared with 35,000 tons same month last year. For the eleven months of this year 401,000 tons have been put into the water, which is a greater quantity than any previous eleven months. New work contracted for during the month is given at 27,000 tons.\nThe import to Glasgow this week amounts to 13,200 loads, to Greenock 1,110 loads, and to Grangemouth 500 loads.\nGREENOCK.\nThe cargo of pitch pine timber per \"Homewood\" (1065) from Ship Island, is the only importation for the week. This consignment consists of 416 logs hewn, 568 logs sawn timber, 685 pcs. stowage deals for Singleton, Dunn & Co., Glasgow.\nDamage to the extent of £30 was occasioned by fire at Russell & Co.'s yard in Main Street, on Saturday last.\nArrangements have been completed for the erection of other three large tenements at the Glen, Port Glasgow.\nIMPORTS.\nALLOA.\nNov. 21 Kurir—Oscarshamn 106 lds. pitprops—Christie Colliery Co.\nSkien—163 lds. pitprops—Kirkwood\nJane—Moss—251 lds. pitprops—M.

W. Beattie on Tuesday, 28th November, at the Edinburgh Dock, but no large business was done. For what was sold, however, fair prices were obtained, and in the case of red offers were made for a good line, but these did not come up to the views of the exposers, and the business fell through.\nThe death of Mr. John Torry, who had long been Clerk to the Leith Dock Commission, has given a shock to the community by its sudden character, for although Mr. Torry was 75 years of age he had been in the enjoyment of good health, and was in the active discharge of his official duties.",
