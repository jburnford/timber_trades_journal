Wilson, of Adam Wilson & Sons, Auchinlech, Troon and Dailly, chairman of the association, presiding.\nThe Secretary, Mr. H. W. Wilson, of Bounybridge, stated that the association finished last year with a membership of 51 and with £5 11s. in hand, whilst this year they had 49 members, and money in hand amounted to £15 2s.\nThe Chairman said that he was sorry the report was not so satisfactory as it might be. It was thought that they would be able to at least double their membership during the past twelve months, but instead of increasing, the number had declined. He thought that as the subscription was only 5s. a year every home timber merchant should avail himself of the association and become a member. The committee had a good many meetings, and had done a good deal of useful work in connection with the workmen's insurance under the Compensation Act. They had been able to get terms of 8s. 6d. per £100 per cent. of wages for all members of the association. They had had long correspondence with H.M. Inspector of Factories regarding saw guards, which resulted in the letter which had been embodied in the circular sent to every member, to the effect that no action would be taken against any member of the association until he (H.M.I. of Factories) could see a more workable guard. They had also under consideration a law suit in which Mr. Garden, of Troup, Banffshire, seeks to interdict Mr. Campbell, of Inverness, from cutting and lifting timber, bought and paid for. The committee were unanimously of opinion that the action was oppressive and illegal, and recommended sending two witnesses to give expert evidence before the court and assist Mr. Campbell to win the case as far as possible.\nThe meeting unanimously adopted the committee's recommendation, the Chairman, Mr. James Wilson, Bonnybridge, member of committee, to give evidence and assist in fighting the case.\nMr. Wm. Wilson was appointed Chairman, and thanking the meeting, urged on timber merchants the necessity of becoming members. He mentioned the good work that had been done by the secretary, Mr. W. H. Wilson, who was re-appointed secretary as well as the previous five members of committee.\nA vote of thanks to the Chairman brought the meeting to a close.\n: O :\nSCOTTISH FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION.\nThe dinner in connection with the Scottish Furniture Manufacturers' Association was held in the North British Station Hotel, Glasgow, on Tuesday night. Mr. Matthew Pollock, Beith, presided, and the croupiers were Mr. Joseph Johnstone, Lochwinnoch, Mr. John Tait, and Mr. John Robertson, Dundee. Among the others present were Councillors Hugh Alexander and Taggart, Mr. Hyslop Stewart, Mr. A. H. Mackintosh, Kirkcaldy; Mr. R. M. Stirling, Glasgow; Mr. William Stewart, Mr. James Walker, Mr. Montgomery, Mr. J. Mooney, Mr. J. Stevenson, Beith; Mr. Andrew Thomson, sen., and Mr. Alexander Russell, writer, the secretary.\nThe loyal toasts having been given and duly honoured, Mr. Lachlan M'Geoch, who sub-\n\nA. & W. FULLARTON,\nWOOD MEASURERS AND FORWARDING AGENTS,\nYORKHILL WHARF, GLASGOW.\n\nDECEMBER 2, 1899\nmitted \"The Scottish Furniture Manufacturers' Association,\" said they had a notable example of what could be done by a masters' association in connection with the work of the Engineering and Employers' Federation. The Chairman, who acknowledged the toast, said that through the aid of the association the members had been able to get through with the great struggle of eighteen months ago, what no single employer would have been able to do without aid. No one regretted that that strike took place. The year in which it took place was a black one, and would be long remembered. The demands of the men at that time, however, had become so aggressive and frequent that something had to be done to save the whole trade from disaster. There was this satisfaction, that such a strike could not again take place before every means had been exhausted for a settlement being brought about by fair and honourable means. Some method ought to be adopted by which strikes could be mutually arranged.\nOther toasts followed.\n: O :\nNATIONAL FORESTRY.\nUnder the presidency of Sir George Birdwood, Mr. D. E. Hutchins, Conservator of Forests at Capetown, last week read a paper before the Society of Arts, in which he urged that the need for a general reforesting of England and the British Isles were essential if they were to be restored to their former beauty and productiveness. The advantage of a comprehensive [?] of wood in the country showed [?]. The advantages [?] system of forestry would [?] ment to capital now la[ying] sols at 2 per cent. ; [it would arrest the] fall in the value of la[nd] caused by the substitu[tion of ?] and would tend to the [abatement of the] smoke nuisance in town[s]. In the forest schools of [Europe] a century ago, natural [forestry] was not a paying con[cern]. [To-day the] country could borrow a [million] a year which, [if] spent—out of public [funds] would return a profit to [the State of] 3 per cent.\n: O :\nSEQUESTRATION.—J. & A.
