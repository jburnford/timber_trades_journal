TEAK CIRCULAR.
Denny, Mott & Dickson report that the landings in the London Docks during November were very light, being only 55 loads of logs and 216 loads of planks, or a total of 271 loads, as against 1,463 loads for the corresponding month of last year. The deliveries into consumption were 761 loads of logs and 412 loads of planks, aggregating 1,173 loads—practically coinciding with the consumption of 1,172 loads in November, 1898. The dock stocks at date analyse as follows:—
1899. 1898.
6,735 loads of logs, as against 8,518 loads.
2,535 " " planks " " 3,731 "
8 " " blocks " " 20 "
Total 9,278 lds. 12,269 lds.
Rates in India, and consequently the f.o.b. prices for Europe, have been firmer than ever, and freights have also risen; but the market on this side responds very reluctantly to the consistently increasing cost of teak, so that, rather than pay the increased values, consumers are stinting their usual purchases, if not seeking to substitute other woods, in both shipbuilding and rolling stock construction.

TRADE REPORTS.
GLASGOW.
Since last writing the import has been small and consists of one full cargo, and parcels by regular liners. The full cargo is "Elektra," from Moser River, N.S., and is principally birch planks consigned to Singleton, Dunn & Co., and is discharging at Yorkhill Wharf. The liners from Montreal have all arrived, with the exception of the "Assyrian," which is due; and the first winter service from St. John, N.B., per "Alcides" is in the river, and has over 300 standards spruce deals on board, consigned to Cant & Kemp, and a portion of which will be given next week. The inquiry in pine deals has limited the meantime transactions are confined to immediate wants. The demand for all qualities, and particularly for deals, in which long prices are asked, continues. Good demand, especially for long lengths, and prices continue very firm at the recent advance.
From Rangoon the "Ava" has landed about 300 loads teak in logs, planks, keys, &c., consigned principally to Edmiston & Mitchells, Cant & Kemp, Henderson & Livingston, and Caud & Co., from which deliveries are being made ex quay.
A considerable import is to hand by the "Indrani," from Baltimore, consisting of oak, whitewood boards, etc., full details of which will be found in import list appended.

A large business has been done during the past week from ship's side in the parcels recently landed from United States, and already some considerable deliveries have been made from the goods per "Indrani."
A good healthy tone pervades the market in furniture woods; the inquiry is good for nearly all varieties, and very little has been stored for future selling.
An auction sale was held at Yorkhill Wharf on the 6th inst., by Singleton, Dunn & Co. There has been a notable change this year in the number of public sales of deals which have been held, and for at least two years the intervals between each sale have become greater, and this one, which was held after a lapse of several months, judging from results, was not encouraging. There was a good attendance, and the catalogue consisted of an attractive variety of pine and spruce deals.
The auctioneer soon perceived that the prices wanted were not likely to be offered, and hurriedly ran over the catalogue, without knocking down a lot. Some business was done, however, privately afterwards.
Imports to Glasgow this week amount to 5,860 loads, and to Greenock 1,200 loads.

LEITH.
There are practically no fresh arrivals of wood goods to report this week, and there cannot now be many more shipments to come forward this season.
Trade is becoming more circumscribed

with shorter days and the year drawing to a close. The weather, too, has become unfavourable for outdoor work, being excessively wet, so that altogether business has been rather slack this week. All the same, in view of the very great increase in prices demanded by shippers' agents for next year's shipments, importers are very firm in their dealings with buyers, and there is no disposition to out prices. In fact, a general revision of rates will require to be made to bring the local values up to the level of estimated cost.
