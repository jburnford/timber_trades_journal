H. Marr, of Hamilton, Marr & Co., Govan Sawmills, presided, and there sat with him on the platform the Rev. W. T. Bankhead, Messrs. John Adams, John Herbertson, Matthew Henderson, Alexander M'William, John Smeaton, J.P., Thomas Kay Simpson, J. C. Bowes, County Councillor Dykes, L. Stewart, William M'Intyre, R. Adam, Meikle Cutts, Samuel Stevenson, C. Marshall, J. P'hail, James Grant, and Mr. M'Intyre, general secretary.\nAfter tea, the Chairman said that the society, under whose auspices they were met that night, had had a year of unparalleled success, adding to their already accumulated funds no less a sum than £3,500 (Applause).\nIt must have been singularly gratifying to them to have helped to attain such a result. (Hear, hear).\nSome of them would remember with pleasure the closing year of this century as having given to all classes of the community the great blessing of plenty of labour for willing hands, for this year as well as last had been one of undoubted prosperity. (Hear, hear).\nThis prosperity in a great measure had been the cause by which they had increased their membership and attained such satisfactory results.\nWages had increased all round, and that must have brought many comforts. (Hear, hear).\nThere was an old saying, that “the fu’ cup was ill to carry.”\nIt was to be sincerely hoped that those who benefited would not forget to lay past some little store against the proverbial rainy day which they had no cause yet to fear, but against which they were safer to make provision.\nThe shipbuilding trade, with which most of the trades in the Glasgow district were inter-woven, had been busy all through the year, and apart from the addition to the merchant service by the magnificent vessels launched, no less a sum than one million and a quarter had been spent in this district by the Admiralty alone in improving the navy.\nIt was without the memory of the speaker, yet some present would remember that 50 years ago Glasgow presented many green fields and commons, and the present burghs were mere villages.\nTo-day they found the city had spread out its arms, and justified its motto to such an extent, that whereas in 1873—the first year in which the valuations of linings granted by the Dean of Guild Court were recorded—they found linings passed to the value of £1,210,514, this year the magnificent sum of £2,017,330 had been reached, being only excelled by the year 1876, when it was £2,125,249, and last year (1898) when it totalled £2,106,760 (Applause).\nWithin the last ten years the linings granted by the Dean of Guild Court in Glasgow amounted to the enormous sum of £13,290,205. (Applause).\nThere was one particularly commendable scheme which their society had in operation—that was old age pensions.\nIn this they had\nCAMERON BROTHERS\nTIMBER IMPORTERS AND SAW-MILLERS,\nPERTH SAW-MILLS, PERTH.\nBRANCH YARD AT NEWBURGH.\nTELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS—“BROTHERS, PERTH.”\n\nF.
