CUCKSON, THOMAS HERBERT, builder and contractor, 144, Bradley Street, Sheffield.—The public examination of the above-named debtor took place at the Sheffield Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Binney. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed liabilities amounting to £5,255, and the assets were estimated to produce £644. Replying to questions put by the Official Receiver, the debtor stated that he could not give any further information in relation to his statement of affairs beyond what he had already done. The examination was eventually ordered to be closed.

FAULKNER, GEORGE STEPHEN, contractor, Blackborough Road, Reigate.—The sitting for the public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Croydon Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, before Mr. Deputy-Registrar Lincoln; Mr. T. W. J. Britten, Assistant Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade, and Mr. Gimblett, the trustee, was present. A list of the trade creditors was given in our last issue. Bankrupt said he commenced business with the amount he received under his father's will. He had no interest under that will now. His assets showed about 40s. in the £, but they were valued as a going concern. His liabilities were £2,485. He had not been able to repay two loans from friends he received in 1894, as he required the capital in the business. He had also had to borrow from Mr. B. S. Thomas, a professional money-lender, for about three years. He believed 50 per cent. was the rate paid. He stated he had paid £200 to money lenders in interest last year. Mr. Britten said he believed it was 60 per cent. Bankrupt said he had no cash book or account of his transactions with Mr. Thomas. There was no bought ledger. He would undertake to send to the Official Receiver all his books. He denied having neglected his business through any cause. Mr. Gimblett said it was hoped the estate would be realised promptly, and then nearly 20s. in the £ would be paid. That was the desire of the Committee of Inspection.—Adjourned until January 17th, 1899.

GOULD, RICHARD, builder and contractor, Abbeville Works, Clapham Common, S.W.—The sitting for the public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Wandsworth Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Willoughby. The liabilities are £818 10s. 9d., and assets £133 13s. 2d. Mr. Hickson appeared for the debtor. Mr. G. H. Acheson, Assistant Official Receiver, said he had to apply for an adjournment. The debtor had filed a cash account as ordered, but it had only been received within the last two days.
