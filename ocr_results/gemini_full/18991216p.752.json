Armstrong & Co., who are the contractors for this part of the work, are now busily engaged in erecting these, and it is expected that in six months they will be completed.\nMeanwhile, the contractor for the dock, Mr. John Best, is engaged constructing the basin, and expects to finish this part of the work soon after the gates are placed in position.\nMr. Best has done the work expeditiously and well, and has successfully surmounted the difficulties incidental to such an undertaking.\nHis experience in this class of work has been very great, and all his contracts have given universal satisfaction.\nLeith has had before proofs of his ability in this direction, the Edinburgh dock there having been constructed by him in 1876, while he was in partnership with his uncle, Mr. Scott.\nAmong large and successful contractors, Mr. Best stands in the front rank.\nIn shipping and mercantile circles great complaints have for years been made as to the insufficiency of the dock accommodation, and strong representations have from time to time been made to the Dock Commissioners, urging upon them to enlarge the scheme of dock extension.\nUltimately they were successful, for while the orginal dock scheme was only for an addition of 800 feet, it was increased by 1,100 feet, thus making the dock 1,900 feet long, and further, it was agreed to construct a new graving dock, capable of taking in the largest vessel that is likely to come to Leith for years to come, and this is so to be constructed that at any time it can easily be lengthened by 100 feet.\nIn no circle has the insufficient dock accommodation been more acutely felt than in the timber trade, and it is to be hoped that the Dock Commissioners will recognise their claims, which have for so many years been neglected, and give greater facilities, not only for landing, but for storing timber.\nIt is possible that the Commissioners could not help it, but hitherto, the trade has been very much hampered and harassed.\nIt is no unusual occurrence for a timber-laden ship or the rafts from a ship to be shifted about from crane to crane, and from one part of the dock to another to make way for other vessels, and even in some cases the process of unloading stopped altogether for a time, thus entailing, not only great delay, but extra expenses; and over and above that, there is a great deficiency in storage accommodation for timber.\nThese things make it very difficult and often impossible for Leith merchants to compete with their brethren in the western metropolis and district, as Grangemouth offers every facility for unloading, no delays or shifting about, the dues are lighter, while the storage is ample, not only for landed timber, but also for manufactured goods.\nIt is to be hoped that the Leith merchants will unite in laying their claims and grievances before the Commissioners, and thus get them redressed.\n---:o:---\nACTION AGAINST DUMFRIES TIMBER MERCHANTS.\nThe Second Division of the Court of Session, at Dumfries, on Friday, gave their decision in the appeal by John Gilchrist Clark, of Speddoch, Dumfries, against Gavin Callander & Sons, timber merchants, Maxwelltown, for payment of £99 12s., being the price of timber cut down on the pursuer's estate.\nIt was averred that in addition to blown timber, which was purchased by contract, the defenders had carried away other timber to the value of the amount sued for.\nInterim-Sheriff Lees, reversing Sheriff-Substitute Campion, found that certain growing timber was cut down and removed that was not included in the contract, and therefore gave decree for the amount sued for, with expenses.\nOn the 2nd inst. the Second Division upheld Sheriff Lee's decision, with additional expenses.\n---:o:---\nTHE CREOSOTING OF TIMBER.\nAt the Yorkshire College Engineering Society, last week, Mr. E. J. Silcock delivered a lecture on the creosoting of timber.\nHis paper might appropriately have been entitled the \"The Life of a Telegraph Pole,\" says a writer in the \"Leeds Mercury,\" for he described in detail the treatment these useful but not very sightly objects require for their preservation.\nDecay in timber is brought about in three ways—by the decomposition in the albumen in the timber, by the action of water, and by the action of insects.\nIt is calculated that an ordinary fir telegraph pole without any chemical preparation will become rotten in seven years.\nIn 1848, 318 creosoted poles were erected between Fareham and Portsmouth.\nIn 1861 they were examined, and only two showed the slightest trace of decay, and these were replaced.\nIn 1883 the poles were still in use, and apparently quite sound.\nHere is another instance which Mr. Silcock quoted.\nIn 1861 40 miles of poles were fixed between Yeovil and Exeter.\nBy way of an experiment they were arranged in threes, the first in each trio being plain, the second one had been boucherised—whatever that may mean—and the third had undergone the creosoting process.\nIn 1870 all the plain poles had been removed, 30 per cent of the boucherised poles were exhausted, while the whole of the creosoted poles were sound.\nMr. Silcock explained in detail various processes of creosoting, and concluded a most instructive address, by recommending creosoting as a cheap and effective process of preserving timber.\n---:o:---\nFor Checking Cargoes Invoices.\n52 pp, 4to Cloth limp.
