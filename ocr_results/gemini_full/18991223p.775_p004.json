W. A., builder, Leytonstone.—The receiving order herein was made in April last upon a creditor's petition, and bankruptcy followed on Wednesday to Mr. Registrar Linklater for an order of discharge. Proofs have been made for £717 6s. 6d., and it is estimated that the liabilities, in respect of which no proofs have yet been made, amount to about £410. The assets, estimated at £280 12s. 5d., have realised £6 13s. 5d. only, and the trustee (Mr. C. A. Bourner) is very doubtful whether anything further will be received. The Official Receiver reported that the debtor, prior to March, 1896, was foreman to his father, who was a builder. He then, with about £80 capital, commenced business on his own account as a speculative builder and contractor, and subsequently built 28 houses at Leytonstone—five on contract, and the remaining 23 under building agreements. It was further reported that the assets were not sufficient to pay 10s. in the £, that the bankrupt had not kept proper books of account, and that he had contributed to his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculations. Mr. Percy Braby said that he represented the trustee, and opposed the application on the same grounds. He submitted that a judgment\n\nshould be entered up against the bankrupt. His Honour said that he took that course. He said that the result of such an order would be to induce the bankrupt to contract fresh liabilities in order to satisfy the judgment with respect to the old ones. What surprised him in these cases was the facility with which persons like the debtor were able to get credit. He suspended the order of discharge for two years.\n\nCHATTERTON, SETH EATON, builder and decorator, York Road, Southend-on-Sea, and Hockley, Essex.—The accounts filed herein disclose gross liabilities £1,173 19s. 3d., of which £661 19s. 3d. is unsecured, and assets consisting of stock-in-trade, trade fixtures, fittings, utensils, etc., £250 ; other property £50 ; book debts, £33 2s. 8d., making £333 2s. 8d. less £12 for preferential claims, which leaves £321 2s. 8d. and shows a deficiency of £340 16s. 7d. The following are trade creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nAcme Wood Flooring Co., London 27 0 0\nBaker & Wright, Southend 57 6 5\nMoy, Thos., Ltd., Colchester 50 19 3\nParkers, Ltd., Birmingham 13 17 0\n\nDEPLEGE, W. T., colliery timber dealer, Stanley Lodge, Stanley, near Wakefield.—The bankrupt attended for his public examination on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Linklater, at the London Bankruptcy Court, on a statement of affairs disclosing a total indebtedness of £20,801 17s. 1d., of which £8,134 11s. 9d. were stated to be unsecured, with assets valued at £2,595 14s. 10d., of which amount £475 was in respect of a surplus from creditors fully secured.—Mr. E. L. Hough appeared as Official Receiver ; Mr. Kershaw on behalf of the trustee, and Mr. Muir Mackenzie for the bankrupt. In reply to the Official Receiver, the bankrupt stated that since November, 1889, he had dealt in colliery timber, his office since 1891 having been at Stanley Lodge, Stanley, near Wakefield. About 1891 he had also dealt in shares of public companies, and had since 1895 acted as director of several companies. In 1898, he went to Western Australia, and whilst there was appointed the owner of lands, which, on his return to this country he sold to a private limited company which had been formed for the purpose of taking over the property. He was appointed a director, and in return for his services he received 34,050 shares in the company, 17,800 of which, in November, 1898, he transferred in satisfaction of a debt of £1,000, the balance being subsequently deposited as security with creditors now treated as fully secured. In May, 1897, he purchased (for £2,250) 4,500 fully-paid £1 shares in the Bunyip Gold Mines, Ltd., of which company he subsequently became a director, and shortly afterwards sold 2,250 of such shares at par. In October, 1898, one of the purchasers brought an action against him, claiming damages for misrepresentation, which action was in the following December settled by his repaying £250 (the purchase price of shares) and £100 costs, and withdrawing imputations. Other purchasers of the Bunyip shares threatened similar actions, but arrangements were come to, whereby he repaid, or agreed to pay, their respective purchase prices. About January last two other actions were begun against withness by another person, claiming (1) the return of £625, money entrusted to him in June, 1895, and (2) £3,750 2s. 6d., damages sustained by reason of misrepresentations in connection with the sale and purchase of gold mining shares, which actions about March last were (when past heard) compromised by his agreeing to pay the sum of £2,200, the plaintiff withdrawing all imputations. On further examination, the bankrupt stated that immediately after that, three other persons, who had during the year 1895 purchased shares from him, claimed the return of their money, and he, thereupon, gave acceptances for the amounts of their respective claims, and deposited as security 1,350, 150, and 1,000 fully paid £1 shares in the private limited company before mentioned. He attributed his insolvency to depreciation in the value of furniture purchased ; to liabilities incurred in connection with the sale and purchase of shares held ; to law costs ; and to the amount agreed to be paid in the action before mentioned as compromised. He attributed his deficiency to depreciation in the value of furniture and shares. The examination was concluded.\n\nGRIFFITH, WILL\n\nUSE K&B SAWN AND PLASTER LATHS. SOLE IMPORTERS.
