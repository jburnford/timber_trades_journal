He said he began building in 1893. Before that he had been in partnership, and on its dissolution he accepted a situation. In 1893 his capital was £80, which represented his savings, and he commenced himself to small contracts and jobbing work. He proceeded satisfactorily, and was able to pay his way until, in March of this year, he undertook to build four houses at Surbiton for £2,500 for a Mr. Palser. That had resulted in a heavy loss. He read the contract, and the conditions before he signed the thought he was doing a good thing. The property was not freehold, and he was liable to a penalty of £10 for the whole of the plant, stock, &c., being the property of the freeholder, and one agreement was that in case of dispute the matter was to be sent to the surveyor for the freeholder, whose decision was to be absolutely. The examination was adjourned.\nGREENBERG AND ATELSON, timber merchants, 115, Bethnal Green Road, and 158, Hackney Road, N.E. The adjourned sitting for public examination under this failure was held before Mr. Registrar Hope on Thursday last. Mr. A. Mackintosh (instructed by Braby & Macdonald) appearing on behalf of Mr. C. A. Bonner, the trustee, and Mr. R Raphael for the bankrupts ; Mr. Howell attending as Assistant Official Receiver. Atelson was further examined by Mr. Mackintosh, and stated that at the private meeting of the creditors of the firm held before the receiving order a composition of 10s. in the £ was offered. Notice was sent to Mr. Griew, but he did not attend the meeting. Mr. Griew might have known, like anybody else, what was done at the meeting. Griew was Greenberg's brother in-law. The firm had considerable dealings with Griew in selling goods to him. Witness was unable to read or write, and the books of the firm were kept by a clerk named Levy, who left their employ about six months before the failure. He further stated that certain sums paid to Mr. Griew were in repayment of advances made to him without security. The moneys received from Griew could be traced in the banking account, which was only placed in the business of Greenberg & Atelson. It was customary in the business for goods to be delivered at the docks or at certain saw mills. They would give delivery orders upon those docks or saw mills when timber was sold to customers, and it was the system adopted in the transactions with Mr. Griew. At the private meeting they offered a composition of 10s. in the £ and the offer was accepted by all the creditors except two. The accepting creditors urged witness and his partner not to file their petition, but to induce the dissenting creditors if possible to accept the proposal. He and his partner had attended on the trustee whenever so required and had given all the assistance and information in their power. The trustee had been very hostile and threatened to put witness into prison or even to hang him (laughter) if he spent every penny in the estate in attempting to do so. Greenberg concurred in the evidence of his partner, and eventually the examination was concluded, the accounts showing total liabilities £2,829 14s. 8d. of which £2,079 6s. 7d. are stated to be unsecured and assets £881 12s. 6d. after providing for preferential claims.\nMORGAN, WILLIAM, builder and contractor, 73, Church Street, Tredegar, Mon.—The Official Receiver (Mr. W. L. Daniel) has issued a summary of the above debtor's statement of affairs, from which it appears the gross liabilities are returned at £1,087 19s. 3d., of which £1,051 9s. 4d. is expected to rank for dividend, assets estimated at £20 1s. 10d., showing an estimated deficiency of £1,030 19s. 5d. Debtor alleges as the causes of failure, Want of capital, losses on contracts, and keen competition.\n\nREGISTERED\nM.K\nTRADE MARK\nAND FOR\nSleepers\nBridges\nPiles\nStair Treads\nPlatforms\nChair Keys\nGate Heels\nPosts\nTelegraph Arms\nPoles\nand\nGeneral\nEngineering\nPurposes.\nREGISTERED\nM.J\nTRADE MARK\nRECORD OUTPUT OF TIMBER.\nThe output of Karri and Jarrah from the Company's Mills for the Six Months ended June 30th, 1899, was\n47,296 LOADS, or 28,377,600 FEET SUPER.\nFull Particulars and Prices on Application to\nMILLARS' KARRI & JARRAH FORESTS, LIMITED,\n72, BISHOPSGATE STREET, LONDON, E.C.\nTelegrams: \"Jarrah, London.\" Telephone: 290 London Wall.\n\nTIMBER TRADE\nSAW SHARPENING\nUSE GLOVER'S\nPATENT MACHI\nS & ERS,\nYORI\nood-Workin\nial Sawing M\nShafting, S\nuisites, &c.\nWitness went into the box and said that on some dates he had occasionally put money of his own into the business when the funds ran short, but some difficulty would be experienced in tracing the payments, and he could not say definitely the total amount of capital he had provided. He thought, however, that the amount was about £350. Cross-examined as to the payment of £170 to Mr. Weinig for the wedding expenses of bankrupt's son, he said that he had the money in gold, and kept it in a bag, which he carried about with him. He did not think that such a lump of money was too heavy to be carried in his pocket. The amount was handed over to Mr. Weinig by witness in his sitting-room. Reply to further questions, the bankrupt stated that in July last his firm purchased timber for £180 from Moss & Co. and sold the same to Mr. Griew for £190. Griew had previously paid £250 which was part of the firm's business to discharge money for bills. Some of those customers' bills were paid into the firm's banking account, whilst others were paid away for goods supplied. When witness became engaged his future father-in-law made him a present of £100, which was paid into the business. The stroke of business was finished, and he was paid 10s. per day. The property became the property of the freeholder by a clause of the contract which provided that in case of dispute reference should be made to the freeholder's surveyor noting for him, and that the surveyor's decision was to be final. The Registrar said that the surveyor, so really the bankrupt had put his hands absolutely into the hands of the freeholder. The examination was adjourned.",
