Somerville, builders, Shettleston, Glasgow.\nThese debtors were publicly examined at the Glasgow Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday last, before Sheriff Strachan.\nIt appeared that the partners began business in February of last year, with a capital of £100, but at the outset no books were kept, so that they did not know whether specific building transactions were profitable.\nThe statement of affairs filed by the debtors showed liabilities amounting to £1,396 14s. 4d., and the assets were estimated to produce £386 17s. 7d., thus leaving a deficiency of £1,019 16s. 9d.\n\nPRESENTATION TO MR. JOHN BAIRD.\n\nEx-Councillor John Baird, of the firm of John Baird & Co., Springfield Saw-mills, Falkirk, was on Saturday evening last met by a deputation from his employees and presented with a solid silver casket, containing an illuminated address, to mark the attainment of his semi-jubilee in business.\nThe presentation, which took place at the residence of Mr. Baird, Prospect Bank, Arnot-hill, was of an informal nature.\nThe testimonial was subscribed to by the office staff and the workmen who had been for ten years and upwards in the employment of the firm.\nIn the address the employees expressed their appreciation of the able and honourable manner in which Mr. Baird had conducted the business from its foundation, till it had reached its present important position among the industries of the district.\nHis relations with the staff had always been of the most harmonious nature, and the consideration he had shown towards them had promoted the good feeling and respect with which he was regarded among them.\nHis public career had been a source of great satisfaction to them, his influence having always been for the honourable and efficient management of the affairs of the community and for the furtherance of the general welfare.\nThe casket, which was beautifully chased, was ornamented with representations of oak leaves, acorns, and circular saws.\nOn the front panel was a bust of Mr. Baird, on the back panel the Falkirk coat of arms.\nAt one end was a sketch of the office and a bogey with wood, while at the other there was a representation of a ship discharging at Grangemouth.\nThe casket was supplied by Mr. Wm. C. Muir, High Street, Falkirk.\n\nGREENOCK CASE IN COURT OF SESSION.\n\nLord Pearson had before him a note of suspension and interdict at the instance of Patrick Rattray, C.A., Glasgow, trustee on the estates of Carmichael, Maclean & Company, shipbuilders, Cartdyke, Greenock, and the partners thereof, against Wyllie, Stewart & Marshall, timber merchants, Glasgow.\nThe complainer sought to suspend a charge given by the respondents on a protested bill for £690 4s. 7d.\nThe complainer pleaded that the respondents, having acceded to the trust deed, were barred from doing diligence on the bill, but the respondents averred that the trustee had not acted upon the instructions of the advisory committee appointed by the trust deed, and further that certain non-acceding creditors had been doing diligence.\nLord Pearson refused the note, with expenses.\nCounsel for Complainer—Mr. Salvesen, Q.C., and Mr. M'Clure.\nAgent—R. Addison Smith, S.S.C.\nCounsel for Respondents—Mr. Shaw, Q.C., and Mr. Younger.\nAgents—Cairns, M'Intosh & Morton, W.S.\n\nTRADE OF THE CLOSING YEAR.\n\nGLASGOW.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADE.\nIn reviewing the timber trade of the Clyde district for the year just closing, it is gratifying to be able to report that the anticipations expressed in our last annual report have been fully realised.\nAll branches have reason to be satisfied with the large volume of business transacted during 1899, though there may leave something to be desired in the way of profits.\nShipbuilding and housebuilding, which are two of the principal timber-consuming industries in the district, have both been particularly active, and it naturally follows that the trade has enjoyed a large demand from these sources.\nIndeed, the quantity absorbed by the former has been abnormal, and almost throughout the entire year the sawmills have been taxed to their utmost capacity to meet the requirements for floorings, linings, and wrought timber.\nIn shipbuilding the amount of timber used is each year becoming less, and the use of timber for decks, deck-houses, finishings, &c., is almost a thing of the past, except in the case of first-class passenger steamers.\nAnother important source of consumption is in the construction of railway rolling stock, and an excellent demand has also been experienced through this channel.\nBox-makers and cabinet-makers, too, have had an increased output during the year, and each has contributed its quota to the large consumption that has taken place.\nThe imports to the Clyde show little variation in the aggregate from last year's figures, there being a slight decrease at Glasgow and a corresponding increase at Greenock.\nThe year opened with stocks above the normal, and although the present actual holding will not be known until the official stock lists are published in the beginning of the year, it is certain it will be found to be less than twelve months ago, though the consumpt has exceeded the import.\nPrices have ruled very firm in almost all kinds of timber, with an advancing tendency as the months have gone past, and have off at the highest level reached.\nOn a rough computation, it may be reckoned that costs have advanced from 15 to 20 per cent. taken as a whole throughout the year.\nAs practically the whole of the timber used in the district may be considered to be sea-borne, it follows that freights rates form a very important factor in values, and the general and gradual upward movement of freights has had considerable bearing on the increased prices which have throughout the season.\nThe year has been remarkably free from failures of any magnitude, and, happily, no trade strikes have arisen to mar the flow of business.\nOwing to the high prices demanded by shippers, and the facilities afforded by the regular steamship lines to import small parcels, merchants have more than ever adopted the principle of filling their wants from consignment, or working only from hand to mouth.\nBy the adoption of this cautious policy some buyers have been caught in the rising market, and have not been able to secure such a margin on their year's trading as the large turnover would justify one to expect.\nWhile trade is naturally very busy, and appearances indicate that it will continue so for some time, the prospects of the coming year are fraught with a degree of uncertainty on account of the possibility of a check to business by the high rate of bank interest, the high level to which prices have attained, and, last but not least, by a probable disorganisation of our market by the calling out of the Reserve forces for service in South Africa.\n\nFURNITURE.\nThe year which has now drawn to a close might be described as both a good and a bad year.\nGood in that the volume of trade exceeded that of the previous year; bad in that it did not come up to expectations.\nThe previous year's trade, which had opened most auspiciously, was hampered by a most protracted strike, and it was prophesied by old furniture buyers that this year would, therefore, be a record one.\nAnd, indeed, the first two months more than realised this hope.\nDuring January and February the trade was far in excess of that of 1898.\nThis continued during March, April, May, June, and July, but then they came to a standstill, and from then onwards trade was very quiet.\nDuring October and November a slight improvement was noticeable, but this was largely neutralised by the quietness of December, over we cannot say.\n\nRAILWAY WAGGON WHEELS.\nThis has been a busy year in the waggon wheel trade.\nMessrs. Pickering & Co. have been working full time, and Messrs. Hurst, Nelson & Co. have been well employed.\nBoth firms have a good year extended before them, and the prospects of a satisfactory year's trade are good.\n\nThe various centres of the engineering industry have been very busy.\nIn some of these had to be granted.\nWages, which were never high, were increased and materials more easily obtained.\nLinings granted during the year were over £11 per ton.\n\nBUILDING.\nThe building trade has been very busy throughout the year.\nThe erection of dwelling-houses has been the principal feature, and the value of these houses is very great, but this year the gross value of property is largely increased by the erection of the new Exhibition buildings, which of course cannot be taken as giving any indication of the value of property for the future.\nThe Exhibition Buildings are of a similar nature to those of the last, and the value deducted from the gross value would be entirely misleading.\nThese and the railway and other works have kept all those engaged in the building trade peopled for some time to come.",
