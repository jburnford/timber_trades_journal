James Duncan & Co. held a public sale on Tuesday, at their Seafield and Assembly Street yards, when a large and varied assortment of American and Baltic timber, deals, battens, &c., was offered. This being the first public sale this firm have had this year, there was a large attendance of buyers, both from town and country, and although the demand was not active and the bidding somewhat slow, a fair quantity of wood goods was disposed of. A beginning was made at the Seafield yard, with the hewn pitch pine and waney board yellow pine timber. The former was passed, as the exposers did not care to press the timber at the low price offered, but the whole of the waney board yellow pine was cleared out at 2s. 2d. to 2s. 8d., averaging about 2s. 4½d. per cubic foot. Some old square yellow pine was offered, and a few lots sold at 1s. 7d. There was also disposed of a quantity of the oak, elm, ash, and hickory, after which an adjournment was made to the Assembly Street yard, where the Baltic deals, battens, and other sawn goods were offered. The sale continued until late in the afternoon, and, as already indicated, a fair quantity of goods was placed. The following is a note of the principal prices:—\nPer cube foot\nWaney board yellow pine 2s. 2d. to 2s. 8d.\nSquare Oak \" (old) 1s. 7d.\nElm \" 2s. 10d. to 3s. 2d.\nHickory \" 2s. 4d.\nAsh (small inferior) 2s. 4d.\n1st yellow pine deals 1s. 6d.\n11x3 3rd \" 3s. 1d.\n\" \" 1s. 2½d.\n\nMessrs.

Henderson, who continues the business.\n\nFATAL ACCIDENTS.—A sad accident occurred on Tuesday at the Stranton Saw-mills of Mr. C. Brown. A boy about sixteen years of age was engaged in his usual occupation of wheeling shavings to the furnace and collecting some from below the machinery, when by some means he was caught in the belting and so severely mutilated that death ensued shortly afterwards.\nA fatal accident occurred at Mr. Stringfellow's timber yard, Hoxton Street, Hoxton, to one of his deal porters, who, whilst engaged on a high stage in piling, missed his footing and fell a distance of 40 ft. He was at once conveyed to the hospital, where he shortly afterwards expired.\n\nPer lin. foot\n11x3 1st Petersburg white 3½d.\n11x4 Swedish red 3½d.\n7x4 Kotka \" 2 1/8d.\n7x2½ \" \" 1 11/16d.\n6½x2½ \" \" 1 3/16d.\n9x3 Riga white 2 1/16d.\n6½x2½ Drontheim white 1 11/16d.\n6x2 \" \" 11d. to 1 3/8d.\n5x2 \" \" 10d. to 1 3/8d.\n4x2 \" \" 1/8d.\n\nSHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.\nFOREIGN CLEARANCES.\nQUEBEC. — Sept. 18th, Royal Visitor, Greenock, 346 loads oak, 5 do. chestnut, 50 do. elm, 40 do. whitewood, 709 do. waney boards, 36 do. square pine, 50 stds. deals, John Burstall & Co. ; 19th, Sardinian (s), Liverpool, 9,980 pcs. deals, 300 bxs. match splints, E.
