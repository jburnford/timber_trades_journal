LEITH.
Importations of wood goods this week are only moderate, consisting of four entire cargoes by sailing vessels, viz., two from Sweden, and one each from Drontheim and Riga, all whitewood deals and battens, besides sundry steamer parcels of lathwood, staves, &c., from Cronstadt, Fiume, and New York.
The general tone of the trade is in the direction of increased quietness, but merchants are looking forward to the opening next week of the contractors' tenders for the construction of the Edinburgh International Exhibition of 1886, as whoever gets the contract will require a large quantity of wood, and that almost at once, for the building will require to be completed within a few months.
Messrs. James Duncan & Co. held a public sale on Tuesday, at their Seafield and Assembly Street yards, when a large and varied assortment of American and Baltic timber, deals, battens, &c., was offered. This being the first public sale this firm have had this year, there was a large attendance of buyers, both from town and country, and although the demand was not active and the bidding somewhat slow, a fair quantity of wood goods was disposed of. A beginning was made at the Seafield yard, with the hewn pitch pine and waney board yellow pine timber. The former was passed, as the exposers did not care to press the timber at the low price offered, but the whole of the waney board yellow pine was cleared out at 2s. 2d. to 2s. 8d., averaging about 2s. 4½d. per cubic foot. Some old square yellow pine was offered, and a few lots sold at 1s. 7d. There was also disposed of a quantity of the oak, elm, ash, and hickory, after which an adjournment was made to the Assembly Street yard, where the Baltic deals, battens, and other sawn goods were offered. The sale continued until late in the afternoon, and, as already indicated, a fair quantity of goods was placed. The following is a note of the principal prices:—

FATAL ACCIDENTS.—A sad accident occurred on Tuesday at the Stranton Saw-mills of Mr. C. Brown. A boy about sixteen years of age was engaged in his usual occupation of wheeling shavings to the furnace and collecting some from below the machinery, when by some means he was caught in the belting and so severely mutilated that death ensued shortly afterwards.
A fatal accident occurred at Mr. Stringfellow's timber yard, Hoxton Street, Hoxton, to one of his deal porters, who, whilst engaged on a high stage in piling, missed his footing and fell a distance of 40 ft. He was at once conveyed to the hospital, where he shortly afterwards expired.
