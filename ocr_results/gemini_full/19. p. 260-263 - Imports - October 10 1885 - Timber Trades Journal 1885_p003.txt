SIXPENNY TELEGRAMS.
In response to numerous requests from correspondents and subscribers, we purpose issuing in our columns a list of registered Telegraphic addresses, which we think will prove a most acceptable adjunct to this paper.
The necessity for the utmost conciseness in the composition of telegraphic messages renders any assistance in this direction invaluable, especially in the wood trade, where the dispatches are numerous and lengthy.
The list will be in the form subjoined, and a nominal charge of one guinea per annum will be made for each address inserted.
Early notification from intending subscribers will oblige, as we are desirous of making the list as complete as possible without delay.
