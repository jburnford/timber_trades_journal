The debtors surrendered at the Lewes Bankruptcy Court on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Blaker, for their public examination. Mr. A. Mackintosh (the Official Receiver) said that the examination would be a lengthy one, and as the first meeting had not been concluded, he thought it best to apply for an adjournment instead of dealing with the matter piecemeal. The Registrar acquiesced, and adjourned the examination till the 30th inst.\nH. W. VINE.—This failure has been previously reported, the debtor being a builder and confectioner of Eastbourne, who recently filed with gross liabilities to the amount of £7,182 7s. 10d., of which it is estimated will rank for dividend £2,133 12s. 10d., against assets £3,916 5s.

At the first meeting of creditors a composition of 8s. in the pound, to be paid within a month, was accepted. At the Lewes Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday, Mr. Isaac Vinall, solicitor, applied for a confirmation of the composition, which had been accepted unanimously by the creditors. The Official Receiver, in his report, stated the composition on the ground that the debtor had committed offences against the Bankruptcy Act. His Honour said he would sanction the scheme, but the books had not been properly kept, and he should be more strict with regard to that matter in future.\nSILSBURY & KINGSWELL. — A receiving order was made against Henry Silsbury and James Kingswell, trading as Silsbury & Kingswell, Grove Road, Ventnor, Isle of Wight, in the Newport Bankruptcy Court, on the 23rd ult.

Assets, £1,112 0s. 1d.
