SIXPENNY TELEGRAMS.
IN response to numerous requests from correspondents and subscribers, we purpose publishing in our columns a list of registered telegraphic addresses, which we think will prove a most acceptable adjunct to this paper.
The necessity for the utmost conciseness in the composition of telegraphic messages renders any assistance in this direction invaluable, especially in the wood trade, where the dispatches are numerous and lengthy.
The list will be in the form subjoined, and a nominal charge of one guinea per annum will be made for each address inserted.
Early notification from intending subscribers will oblige, as we are desirous of making the list as complete as possible without delay.

ROGERS & HUBARD.—This case was reported last week. The debtors surrendered at the Lewes Bankruptcy Court on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Blaker, for their public examination. Mr. A. Mackintosh (the Official Receiver) said that the examination would be a lengthy one, and as the first meeting had not been concluded, he thought it best to apply for an adjournment instead of dealing with the matter piecemeal. The Registrar acquiesced, and adjourned the examination till the 30th inst.
H. W. VINE.—This failure has been previously reported, the debtor being a builder and confectioner of Eastbourne, who recently filed with gross liabilities to the amount of £7,182 7s. 10d., of which it is estimated will rank for dividend £2,133 12s. 10d., against assets £3,916 5s. The debtor surrendered at the Lewes Bankruptcy Court on Friday. Mr. Mackintosh, Official Receiver, represented the estate, and Mr. Glenister (Davenport & Glenister, of Hastings), the debtor, who was subjected to a brief examination, which was adjourned till the 30th inst.
HARRY STEVENS.—This failure has been previously reported. At the first meeting of creditors a composition of 8s. in the pound, to be paid within a month, was accepted. At the Lewes Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday, Mr. Isaac Vinall, solicitor, applied for a confirmation of the composition, which had been accepted unanimously by the creditors. The Official Receiver, in his report, stated the composition on the ground that the debtor had committed offences against the Bankruptcy Act. His Honour said he would sanction the scheme, but the books had not been properly kept, and he should be more strict with regard to that matter in future.
SILSBURY & KINGSWELL. — A receiving order was made against Henry Silsbury and James Kingswell, trading as Silsbury & Kingswell, Grove Road, Ventnor, Isle of Wight, in the Newport Bankruptcy Court, on the 23rd ult. The first meeting of creditors was held at the Chamber of Commerce, 145, Cheapside, London, E.C., on Saturday morning, under the presidency of Mr. Samuel Wheeler (Official Receiver), who reported that the statement of affairs filed in the matter showed total liabilities £2,000, and net assets £967 11s. 1d., with a deficiency of £924 13s. 1d., which the debtors attributed to bad debts. An offer of 5s. in the pound was made, but owing to the furniture of both debtors being claimed by their respective wives it was decided to adjourn the meeting till after the public examination.

was held at the Town Hall, Newport, Isle of Wight, on Wednesday, before his Honour Judge Leonard. Mr. Samuel Wheeler represented the estate, and Mr. T. Hamilton Urry the bankrupts. Kingswell was first examined, and said their statement disclosed all the assets they possessed. They had been endeavouring to effect a private arrangement through Mr. Urry. A circular of September, in which the liabilities were placed at £1,200. Amongst the assets were book debts, good, £240, but the witness explained that some had been paid, and others set-offs, which reduced the amount to £169, and furniture in his house in the statement. The house belonged to his wife, who let lodgings. She purchased it with money she had when they were married. The rent of the house was £70, held on a lease. He had some property in his separate estate, but it was fully mortgaged. Silsbury was also examined as to his furniture, which he stated to pass to his partner's.

G. PRINCE.—The bankruptcy of George Prince, of Holland Street, Blackfriars Road, Peckham, lawn tennis racquet maker and turner, and saw-mill proprietor, passed his public examination before Mr. Registrar Pepys, on Tuesday, upon accounts showing unsecured debts, £1,887 9s. 8d.; debts fully secured, £998 19s. 11d.; and preferential claims, £15. Assets, £1,112 0s. 1d. He stated in the course of his examination that his business had latterly been injured by the importation of Swedish and Norwegian turnery goods at such prices that he was unable to compete with them, and his failure was also partly attributable to the introduction of glass screw stoppers for mineral water bottles.
