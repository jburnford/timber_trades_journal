TURNER.\n6, Lime-street, London House, West India Dock Road, London, E., May 5th, 1885.\n\nDOCK CHARGES FOR LATHS.\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nSir,—The charges made by the several dock companies are very often complained of as being extremely high, but I have never seen a more unjust charge than that made for laths by the West India Dock Company.\nA friend of mine imported from Gothenburg 500 bundles of laths of various lengths of which averaged about 3ft.\nThe freight from Gothenburg amounted to £2 1s. 8d.\nThe Dock Company calculated this parcel to be equal to one standard 5 3/4 for which they charged £2 1s. 8d., or exactly the same amount as had been paid for the freight.\nIt is not to be wondered at that trade seeks cheaper channels when such enormous charges it is not to be wondered at that trade seeks cheaper channels for conducting such stuff, as it wou'd not have to pay half the amount at any other port in the kingdom.—I am, &c.,\nA SUBSCRIBER.\nMay 5th, 1885.\n\nLEGAL INTELLIGENCE.\nACTION FOR BREACH OF AGREEMENT.\nCHRYSTIE v. M. I. WILSON & Co.\nAt the Liverpool Assizes, on the 5th inst., the case of Chrystie v. M. I. Wilson & Co. was heard.\nThe plaintiff, Alfred N. Chrystie, a timber merchant, of Havre, sued M. I. Wilson & Co., timber merchants, of Liverpool, to recover £75 for breach of contract.\nMr. Tobin appeared for the plaintiff, the defendants being unrepresented by counsel.\nIt appeared that Wilson & Co., of Liverpool, shipped a cargo of timber to the plaintiff at Havre, and in consequence of some irregularities in the shipment he declined to honour a draft which was drawn upon him by Wilson & Co.\nThe defendants’ firm then undertook to guarantee the plaintiff against any loss if he accepted the draft, which he did, and under those circumstances he brought the present action.\nThe defence was that the nephew who made the contract—the nephew was a principal in the defendants’ firm—had no authority to act in their name.\nThe jury found for the plaintiff.\n\nThe barque Harmonic was passed at sea, abandoned and waterlogged.\nBarque Harmonic (Nor.), Capt. Jensen, left Pensacola, March 4th, for London.\nThe above may be the vessel referred to.\n\nTHE NATIONAL INVENTORS’ INSTITUTION.—In consequence of the opening of the Inventions Exhibition, Mr. Edward G. Peyton, of Jesus College, Cambridge, has issued a pamphlet in which he suggests the formation of a National Inventors’ Institution, as a means of bringing meritorious inventions immediately before the public.\n\n‘These are not much in our way, except that, like nearly every other civilized being, we wear a head gear of some sort.\nThat this should be of the newest style and of good material is the accepted sign of respectability.\nMr. Karl Kreutz, of 120, Newgate-street, E.C., timber merchants, so Mr. Karl Kreutz informs us.\nThis and the fact that the trade are sadly deficient in what is engaged in the trade and visible sign” of their respectability, as an inducement to them to mend their ways in this respect, Mr. Kreutz offers a reduction of 10 per cent. to all timber merchants who will purchase his stylish and durable articles of head dress.\nWe are given to understand that he re-puts “the chimney-pot” to a pristine gloss of the praiseworthy (h)attempt to ameliorate the condition of a “deserving class” will doubtless meet with due appreciation.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.\nImports of mahogany, &c., appear under the heading of “Mahogany and Hardwoods” on another page.—ED.]\nBARNSTAPLE.\nMay 4 John—Drammen—27,875 planed flooring boards—How & Co.\nBERWICK.\nApr. 29 Chieftain—Apalachicola—80 pcs. hewn fir, 300 pcs. sawn fir, 103 deals—Allan Bros.\nMay 1 Cornwall (s)—New York—13 cs. handles—T.
