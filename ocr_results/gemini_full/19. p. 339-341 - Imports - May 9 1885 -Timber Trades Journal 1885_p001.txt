CORRESPONDENCE
PADOUK WOOD.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
Sir,—I wish to correct an error which you made in your last paper, May 2nd, Trade Notes, page 309.
You say there has been a very active demand for Sabiou during past week to fill large Government contracts for the manufacture of gun carriages for the use of our troops in India.
The Government authorities specified the use of a certain timber called “Padouk,” a wood of a bright red colour, and which is not attacked by the white ant, but from the absence of this wood in the English market Sabicu has been substituted.
This is not correct, as I am now executing an order for 6,000 bars out of Padouk wood, and have enough wood in stock to execute another order of the same quantity if required.

DOCK CHARGES FOR LATHS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
Sir,—The charges made by the several dock companies are very often complained of as being extremely high, but I have never seen a more unjust charge than that made for laths by the West India Dock Company.
A friend of mine imported from Gothenburg 500 bundles of laths of various lengths of which averaged about 3ft.
The freight from Gothenburg amounted to £2 1s. 8d.
The Dock Company calculated this parcel to be equal to one standard 5 3/4 for which they charged £2 1s. 8d., or exactly the same amount as had been paid for the freight.
It is not to be wondered at that trade seeks cheaper channels when such enormous charges it is not to be wondered at that trade seeks cheaper channels for conducting such stuff, as it wou'd not have to pay half the amount at any other port in the kingdom.—I am, &c.,

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
ACTION FOR BREACH OF AGREEMENT.
CHRYSTIE v. M. I. WILSON & Co.
At the Liverpool Assizes, on the 5th inst., the case of Chrystie v. M. I. Wilson & Co. was heard.
The plaintiff, Alfred N. Chrystie, a timber merchant, of Havre, sued M. I. Wilson & Co., timber merchants, of Liverpool, to recover £75 for breach of contract.
Mr. Tobin appeared for the plaintiff, the defendants being unrepresented by counsel.
It appeared that Wilson & Co., of Liverpool, shipped a cargo of timber to the plaintiff at Havre, and in consequence of some irregularities in the shipment he declined to honour a draft which was drawn upon him by Wilson & Co.
The defendants’ firm then undertook to guarantee the plaintiff against any loss if he accepted the draft, which he did, and under those circumstances he brought the present action.
The defence was that the nephew who made the contract—the nephew was a principal in the defendants’ firm—had no authority to act in their name.
The jury found for the plaintiff.

The barque Harmonic was passed at sea, abandoned and waterlogged.
Barque Harmonic (Nor.), Capt. Jensen, left Pensacola, March 4th, for London.
The above may be the vessel referred to.

THE NATIONAL INVENTORS’ INSTITUTION.—In consequence of the opening of the Inventions Exhibition, Mr. Edward G. Peyton, of Jesus College, Cambridge, has issued a pamphlet in which he suggests the formation of a National Inventors’ Institution, as a means of bringing meritorious inventions immediately before the public.

‘These are not much in our way, except that, like nearly every other civilized being, we wear a head gear of some sort.
That this should be of the newest style and of good material is the accepted sign of respectability.
Mr. Karl Kreutz, of 120, Newgate-street, E.C., timber merchants, so Mr. Karl Kreutz informs us.
This and the fact that the trade are sadly deficient in what is engaged in the trade and visible sign” of their respectability, as an inducement to them to mend their ways in this respect, Mr. Kreutz offers a reduction of 10 per cent. to all timber merchants who will purchase his stylish and durable articles of head dress.
We are given to understand that he re-puts “the chimney-pot” to a pristine gloss of the praiseworthy (h)attempt to ameliorate the condition of a “deserving class” will doubtless meet with due appreciation.
