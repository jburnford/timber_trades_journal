HOLLOWAY'S PILLS
Sir SAMUEL BAKER,
In his work on the Sources of the Nile, says:—
"I ordered my dragoman Mahomet to inform the "Faky that I was a doctor, and that I had the best "medicines at the service of the sick, with advice "gratis. In a short time I had many applicants, to "whom I served out a quantity of Holloway's Pills. "These are most useful to an explorer, as possessing "unmistakable purgative properties, they create an "undeniable effect upon the patient, which satisfies "him of their value."
This fine Medicine cures all disorders of the Liver, Stomach and Bowels, is a GREAT PURIFIER OF THE BLOOD, and in all ailments incidental to Females is wonderfully efficacious—it is a medicine for all times and seasons, and for rich and poor, young or aged.
