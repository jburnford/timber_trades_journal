B., builder, Ealing Green, W.—This case was noticed last week, and the first statutory meeting was held on Tuesday, before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The unsecured liabilities are returned at £6,631 15s. 11d., and debts fully secured £56,111 1s. 8d., with assets nil. The debtor had already been adjudged bankrupt, and appeared on his behalf. Some discussion took place as to the appointment of a trustee, but in the result no resolution was passed, and the Official Receiver will therefore wind up the proceedings.\nBARONS, W. H.—At the East Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, before Mr. R. G. Edmonds, Registrar, W. H. Barons, carpenter and joiner, of Garfield House, Axtown, Horrabridge, Devonshire, came up for his public examination. Debtor's statement of affairs showed a deficiency of £354 19s. 9d. Debtor attributed his failure to pressure by a creditor, and inability to sell his house at Axtown. The Official Receiver's observations were that the debtor commenced business two years and two months ago as a carpenter and joiner at Axtown, Horrabridge, without any capital, and previous to that he was in the United States of America. The debtor had two houses at Axtown, known as Garfield House and Tecumseh House, which with the household furniture and stock-in-trade, he estimated to be worth £1,500, but the property was subject to a mortgage. The deficiency was accounted for by household, travelling, and legal expenses, interests, costs, and expenses incurred in endeavouring to dispose of his houses. Mr. H. Greenway, who appeared for the Official Receiver at the examination, said he did not propose to ask the debtor any questions, as it was uncertain whether there would be any estate, the estimated assets consisting entirely of the surplus of the property which was mortgaged, and had not yet been realised. The Registrar thereupon adjourned the examination until May 18th, before the judge. The following are creditors:—\nUNSECURED.\n£ s. d.\nBaker W.

Replying to the Official Receiver (Mr. J. C. Moberly, M.A.), bankrupt said he started business in January, 1886, having succeeded to the business of his father, who had then just died. Up to then the business was a success, and his father left a good deal of property. He left the business in January last, having in the previous December sold a portion of the stock by auction, and the remainder in a similar way. He could not say what amount was realised. The accounts of the business were then handed to the debtor, who said that they appeared to be correct. Between December and January he bought a quantity of goods, but did not pay any cash for them, the same being allowed off his share of the residue. He believed the executors' accounts to be correct. The business of his father proved of little value, as the foreman left, and he lost all the work of the Government offices. The foreman first discovered his expenses by some means securing it. He did not know this when he could not pay his expenses. He should assume this was about June, 1886. He had assisted his father in the business, but knew nothing about the practical part of it. That was the whole fault of it. The money realised by the sale of his effects was paid him by instalments, but he did not bank the money, having cashed the cheques given him. Did not then know he was",
