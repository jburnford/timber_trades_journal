The Trust has approved of the position taken up by the secretary, and instructed him to submit a print of the bill after the same had been introduced into the House.\n\nTHE STOPPAGE OF KINGHORN SHIPBUILDING YARD.\nThe closing of Kinghorn Shipbuilding Yard, where so recently from 500 to 600 workmen found employment, is a serious affair for the town of Kinghorn at the opening of the year. At a very busy time as many as 1,000 workmen have been employed at the yard, which has been the mainstay of the place. As, however, two vessels are in course of construction, one well advanced, good hopes are entertained that work will shortly be resumed. Meantime most of the workmen have left the district, many for Glasgow, while others have come to England in search of employment.\n\n29\nGLASGOW.\nDamage to the extent of £300 was done by fire, water, and smoke at the cabinet and chair factory of Crichton & Mooney, Nesbet Street, on Saturday last week. A quantity of loose timber on the top of a boiler was destroyed by fire last week at the premises of J. Watt, Torrace & Co., Maxwell Road.\n\nCAMPBELTOWN.\nThe death of Mr. Donald Mackay, ship-builder, occurred at his residence, Greystones Cottage, on Friday, the 22nd ult. Mr. Mackay was born in 1836, and served his apprentice-ship with Barclay, Curle & Co., of Glasgow, and afterwards commenced business in Camp-beltown. On the formation of the Campbel-town Shipbuilding Company in 1878, he entered the partnership of the firm. He was one of the best known men in the district, and was deeply interested in its welfare.\n\nAN ABERDEEN ENGINEERING INVENTION.\nWhat appears to be a very practical, as well as ingenious mechanical arrangement, has just been patented by Mr. G. Duncan, engineer with the North of Scotland and Orkney and Shetland Steam Navigation Company, Aberdeen, with the view of preventing loss of life by steam pipe explosions or other similar oc-currences. The patent is obtained on an automatic shut-off throttle valve. The throttle valve is placed next the main-stop valve on boilers. It consists of a long enough chest, with one end open, to allow sufficient space between the centre of the chest and the centre of the throttle valve to admit the steam cylinder to operate the valve. In the event of a steam pipe bursting, a casing door giving way, or a tail shaft breaking, the increased velocity of steam oper-ates a disc and the throttle valve is shut, with the result that a further inrush of steam into the engine-room or stoke-hole is prevented. The invention has been laid before the Board of Trade.\n\nGREENHEART,\nMACLEAN, TODD, & CO\nGREENOCK.\nTelegraphic Address.—\"GREENHEART.\"\n\nJAMES JONES,\nTIMBER MERCHANT,\nLARBERT\nEvery description of round and cut-up Home Timber supplied for Collieries, Cartwrights, Coachbuilders, Shipbuilders, &c.\n\nESTABLISHED 1857.\nM. & J.
