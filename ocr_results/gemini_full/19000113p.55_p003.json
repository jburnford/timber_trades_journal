The liabilities were re-\nported to be £1,117, and the assets £613,\nshowing a deficiency of £504. The following\nare among the creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nAdams, Jno, Derby .. .. .. 30 0 0\nGraham & Bennett, Derby .. .. 17 8 0\nRoe's Timber Co., Ltd., Derby .. 207 18 11\nSmart & Elsom, Derby .. .. 202 2 9\n\nBATCHELOR, GEORGE, the younger\nformerly trading at Strood, Rochester, as a\ncontractor.—This was an application for dis-\ncharge made before his Honour Judge Sir\n\n57\nIn\nSAWN PLANKS\nand SCANTLINGS\nCUT TO SIZES,\nSAWN and HEWN\nLOGS.\n\nWilliam L. Selfe, at the Rochester County\nCourt, on Wednesday. The receiving order\nwas made in September of 1898, the total lia-\nbilities being just over £1,000. The Official\nReceiver (Mr. R. T. Tatham) reported that a\nfirst and final dividend of 7s. 2½d. had been\ndeclared. He submitted two offences against\nthe debtor, that of omitting to keep such\nbooks of account as were usual and proper\nin his business, so as to disclose his financial\nposition within three years of the bankruptcy,\nand also that he had continued to trade after\nknowing himself to be insolvent. The attention\nof the Court was directed to a transaction of\ndebtor's with Crudall & Co., timber merchants.—Debtor\nstated that he was doing nothing\nnow, but had worked at a salary of about\n30s. a week on an average since his\nbankruptcy. His wife was now carrying on\nhis late business, and he had to admit he as-\nsisted her in that. His wife herself entered\ninto the contracts.—His Honour con-\nsidered both the charges brought against the\ndebtor by the Official Receiver to be estab-\nlished, but said the discharge would be granted\nsubject to the debtor consenting to judgment\nbeing entered up against him for the payment\nof £125, after setting aside £2 per week for\nthe maintenance of debtor and his family.\n\nCASTLE, WM. and HY., builder, 97 and\n99, Southwark Bridge Road, S.E.—The debtors\nrecently filed their own petition, and the first\nmeeting of their creditors was held on Tues-\nday, before Mr. E. L. Hough, senior Official\nReceiver. Accounts were lodged showing lia-\nbilities £1,545 11s. 2d., and assets £783,\nsubject to preferential claims for £104. The\ncreditors include :—\n£ s. d.\nMay & Son, Old Kent Road, S.E. .. 12 4 6\nBenton & Son, Cannon Street, E.C. 66 14 7\nRoss, Smith & Co., Lower Road,\nRotherhithe.. .. .. .. 69 7 6\nThe Official Receiver stated that the debtors\nbegan partnership in 1876. The business up\nto 1868 was carried on by their father, but he\nretired in that year, and the elder brother then\ntook the business. The firm attributed their\nfailure to losses on accommodation bills, law\ncosts, and falling off of trade. The case now\nwent into bankruptcy, Mr. R. J. Ward,\nchartered accountant, Clement's Inn, being\nappointed trustee to wind up the estate.—The\npublic examination of the debtors is fixed for\nFebruary 7th.\n\nCOOPER, ALFRED GEO., builder and\ndecorator, 96, High Street, Fulham, S.W.—\nDebtor filed his own petition, and the first\nmeeting of creditors was held on Friday, before\nMr. E. L. Hough, senior Official Receiver.\nThe statement of affairs was not filed, but the\nliabilities are estimated at about £500, with\nassets of small value. Andrews & Son, tim-\nber merchants, of East Molesey, are returned as\ncreditors for £150. The Chairman stated that\nthe debtor formerly carried on business as a\npublican, and at Christmas, 1894, started as\n\nTIMBER FROM CORSICA.\nSPECIALITY :—Railway Sleepers, Wood Paving, etc.\nSAW MILLS and FORESTS at SOLENZARA, AJACCIO, COZZANO, PROPRIANO, PORTO.\nFERRAND & CO., 3, PLACE DU CIRQUE NANTES (FRANCE).\nOFFICES:—8, PLACE DE LA MADELEINE, PARIS.\nAddress Correspondence to 8, Place de la Madeleine, Paris.\nRed and White Corsican Pine, Spruce, Maritime Pine, Alder, Elm,\n......
