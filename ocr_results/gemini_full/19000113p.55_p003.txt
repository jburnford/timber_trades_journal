went Bridge, Derby, one of the creditors was

William L. Selfe, at the Rochester County
Court, on Wednesday. The receiving order
was made in September of 1898, the total lia-
bilities being just over £1,000. The Official
Receiver (Mr. R. T. Tatham) reported that a
first and final dividend of 7s. 2½d. had been
declared. He submitted two offences against
the debtor, that of omitting to keep such
books of account as were usual and proper
in his business, so as to disclose his financial
position within three years of the bankruptcy,
and also that he had continued to trade after
knowing himself to be insolvent. The attention
of the Court was directed to a transaction of
debtor's with Crudall & Co., timber merchants.—Debtor
stated that he was doing nothing
now, but had worked at a salary of about
30s. a week on an average since his
bankruptcy. His wife was now carrying on
his late business, and he had to admit he as-
sisted her in that. His wife herself entered
into the contracts.—His Honour con-
sidered both the charges brought against the
debtor by the Official Receiver to be estab-
lished, but said the discharge would be granted
subject to the debtor consenting to judgment
being entered up against him for the payment
of £125, after setting aside £2 per week for
the maintenance of debtor and his family.

CASTLE, WM. and HY., builder, 97 and
99, Southwark Bridge Road, S.E.—The debtors
recently filed their own petition, and the first
meeting of their creditors was held on Tues-
day, before Mr. E. L. Hough, senior Official
Receiver. Accounts were lodged showing lia-
bilities £1,545 11s. 2d., and assets £783,
subject to preferential claims for £104. The
creditors include :—
£ s. d.
May & Son, Old Kent Road, S.E. .. 12 4 6
Benton & Son, Cannon Street, E.C. 66 14 7
Ross, Smith & Co., Lower Road,
Rotherhithe.. .. .. .. 69 7 6
The Official Receiver stated that the debtors
began partnership in 1876. The business up
to 1868 was carried on by their father, but he
retired in that year, and the elder brother then
took the business. The firm attributed their
failure to losses on accommodation bills, law
costs, and falling off of trade. The case now
went into bankruptcy, Mr. R. J. Ward,
chartered accountant, Clement's Inn, being
appointed trustee to wind up the estate.—The
public examination of the debtors is fixed for
February 7th.

COOPER, ALFRED GEO., builder and
decorator, 96, High Street, Fulham, S.W.—
Debtor filed his own petition, and the first
meeting of creditors was held on Friday, before
Mr. E. L. Hough, senior Official Receiver.
The statement of affairs was not filed, but the
liabilities are estimated at about £500, with
assets of small value. Andrews & Son, tim-
ber merchants, of East Molesey, are returned as
creditors for £150. The Chairman stated that
the debtor formerly carried on business as a
publican, and at Christmas, 1894, started as
