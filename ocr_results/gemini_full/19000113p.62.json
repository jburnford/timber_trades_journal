Macandrew & Co., who celebrated their jubilee on Tuesday last week. The top flat of the three-storey building, which was chiefly built of wood, was destroyed with its contents. The damage is estimated at £2,000.\n\nTHE 1899 COMPLETE LIST OF\nQuality Marks ON SAWN AND PLANED WOOD\nExported from BALTIC, CANADA, &c.,\nwith NAMES of SELLING AGENTS.\nPrice 6/- in Cloth; in Leather 7/6.

The point at issue was whether an addition to the dining and recreation hall fell within the contract. Lord Pearson has dismissed the note, and found the respondents entitled to expenses. He said the arbitration clause bore to submit to the architect questions concerning the meaning of the contract, and he did not think he was running counter to any of the decided cases when he held that prima facie the clause covered the questions which had arisen between the parties; and he took leave to add that the kind of question which had emerged was quite as well fitted for the decision of an architect as of a Court of Law. It was a question no doubt depending to some extent on the legal construction, but it was a mixed question of law and fact arising during the progress of the work, and touching the true intent and meaning of the contract. Counsel for the complainers—Mr. Dewar. Agents Davidson & Syme, W.S. Counsel for the respondents—Mr. Campbell, Q.C., and Mr. G. Addison Smith. Agent—R. Addison Smith, S.S.C.\n\nTHE AFFAIRS OF A GREENOCK SHIPBUILDING FIRM.\nA meeting of the creditors in the sequestration of Carmichael, Maclean & Co., shipbuilders, Greenock, for the election of a trustee was held in the Faculty Hall, Glasgow, on Wednesday, when there voted for the election of Mr. Patrick Rattray, C.A., 60 creditors claiming £28,600, and in favour of Mr. Robert Reid, C.A., 21 creditors claiming £19,000. Mr. J. C. Crawford, of J. C. Smith, Macdonald & Crawford, represented Mr. Rattray.\nWith regard to the above it is reported that the trusteeship in this sequestration has not yet been finally decided. There appears to be a dispute as to the validity of a shipowner's claim of £17,000, which affects the voting.\n\nMILL FIRE IN AMERICA.\nThe saw mill of the Perkins Manufacturing Company and the Georgia Iron Works, owned by the Perkins Manufacturing Company, were destroyed by fire on December 26th. The loss is $175,000. It was only owing to the absence of wind that many near-by dwelling-houses were not swept away. The loss on the lumber stored in the yards, is $125,000, and on the Georgia Iron Works, mill and machinery, $50,000.\n\nFINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE EDINBURGH BUILDING TRADE.\nDuring the past week difficulties have arisen in the building trade in Edinburgh, and Mr. J. Slater, builder and contractor, 172, Easter Road, Edinburgh, has suspended payment. A. & J. Robertson, C.A., have issued a circular regarding his affairs. These are said to be involved and complicated, and as Mr. Slater was unable to submit any offer to his creditors, it was deemed advisable, in order to cut down any possible preferences, to take out sequestration. On Monday sequestration was awarded by the Court of Session, and Mr. J. A. Robertson-Durham has been appointed judicial factor on the estate. Mr. Slater's liabilities are said to be considerable.\nWe understand that further failures are anticipated, the principal cause of the collapse being the dearness of money, which has wiped out the margin of profit, and the disposition of banks to restrict advances.\nIt is reported that matters have reached a more acute stage, and, in addition to another builder who has executed a trust deed on behalf of his creditors, a firm of Leith solicitors are reported to have failed. This firm are creditors of Slater to the extent of £28,000. The firms most heavily hit are in Leith, and the position there is strained.\n\nMUIRHEAD & SONS,\nTimber Importers & Saw-Millers,\nGrangemouth Saw Mills.\nTelegraphic Address:—\"Muirhead, Grangemouth.\"\n\nTo Fit the Waistcoat Pocket.\nIn Limp Cloth, 3in. x 4in. for the Waistcoat Pocket, Price Sixpence.\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL POCKET CALCULATOR.\nPrice per lineal ft. | All sizes, from 4-in. x 2-in.\n\" \" standard | to 4-in. x 12-in.; also\n\" \" cube | number of running feet\n\" \" ton, 66ft. | in standard.\nComparative price per standard and per yard of Flooring.\nPrice per Standard to running feet and cube from £4 10s. to £19 10s.\nComparative price per Cube, Standard, and Load and Ton.\nComparative price per standard and per yard of Flooring\nRailway carriage comparison per ton, per cube, and per lineal foot.\nWILLIAM RIDER & SON, LIMITED.\nTimber Trades Journal Office,\n164, ALDERSGATE STREET, LONDON, E.C.",
