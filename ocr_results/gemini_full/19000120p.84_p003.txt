THE RE-AFFORESTING OF IRELAND.
The question of the re-afforesting of Ireland is now on the tapis, and practical steps are being taken in that direction by public men interested in the matter.
At the quarterly meeting of the Cork County Council held last week, an important resolution on the subject was adopted.
The absence of trees and standing timber in Ireland is one of the greatest drawbacks of the country.
With trees on barren and waste hill sides, at present quite utilitarian, the scenic attractiveness of Ireland would be greatly enhanced.
From a purely utilitarian point of view, the subject is of the first importance, and this is the opinion expressed by the Cork County Councillors in their resolution (carried unanimously), which runs as follows:—"That as this council is allowed to proceed unchecked to injure the present and future prospects of the country, and destroy its beauty, we ask the Irish members of Parliament to prepare a short Bill and do all in their power to have it passed in the next session, to restrain and regulate the wholesale destruction of the forests in the country, and compel every owner, seller, or purchaser to plant two or three trees for every one cut down, and give power to the County Councils to deal with this subject, and also take steps towards the re-afforesting of Ireland.
That we ask all the Irish County Councils in their respective Councils."
It is to be hoped that this resolution, which is to be circulated amongst all the Irish County Councils, will lead to practical results.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in bankruptcy lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

ADAMS, JOHN, builder, Derby.—The debtor's examination was closed on Tuesday at the Derby Bankruptcy Court.
ALLEN BROS., builders, Hendon.—A private meeting of creditors under the deed was held on Wednesday at the Cannon Street Hotel.
A statement of affairs gives the liabilities at £1,376 9s. 2d., and assets, stock and book debts £300.
There is a property complete, upon which £990 would have been expended, there would then be a surplus from that property for the benefit of creditors, provided the landlord would agree to the work being carried out.
A resolution was passed that Mr. A. C. Bourner, of the Timber Trades Association, Bush Lane House, Cannon Street, E.C., be appointed trustee under a committee of inspection.
The following gentlemen as a committee of inspection: Messrs. Harding (Harding & Vick), Hawkins (Hawkins & Co.), Mansfield (Lee & Sons), and Lockhart.
The following are amongst the creditors:—
Harding & Vick ... 128 12 1
Vigers Bros. ... 120 18 1
Lee & Sons ... 120 10 7
ASMAN, DESTIN WILLIAM.—The examination was closed on Thursday at the Bradford County Court.
BEYSON, GEO., Mooretown ; EVAN REES, and REES, Llansamlet (Glamorganshire), carrying on business as Beyson, Thomas and Rees, builders, Skewen.—The public examination of these debtors (represented by Mr. A. R. Thomas), was held at Neath Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, the 11th inst., before Mr. Registrar Charles.
The estimated liabilities totalled £1,193 1s. 11d., and the deficiency £1,159 2s. 9d., failures attributed to losses on contracts and bad debts.
Debtors had executed no deed of partnership, but each had an equal share in the business.
Payments were suspended last October 5s. in the £ offered, payable at one month, but the offer was refused.
They only kept a cash-book.—The Official Receiver did not consider the indefiniteness of detail as to the date of last money receipt satisfactory.
The cash book only covered 1898 and 1899, and debtors were trading five years.—Mr. Thomas promised he would try and find the other books.—The Court, and the case was then adjourned.
COLE, WALTER HORACE, builder, Ley Street, Ilford.—The first meeting of the creditors interested hereunder took place at the offices of the Official Receiver for the Chelmsford district, Temple Avenue, E.C., on Tuesday, under the presidency of Mr. Mercer.
The statement of affairs filed by the debtor disclosed gross liabilities amounting to £1,257 11s. 6d., due to 32 unsecured creditors.
The assets amounted to £30, thus showing a deficiency of £1,227 11s. 6d.
The debtor stated that he first became aware that he had not sufficient property to pay his debts in full two months ago.
He attributes his insolvency to increase in price of materials and bad debts.
Eventually the estate was left in the hands of the Official Receiver.
FAULKNER, GEORGE STEPHEN, builder and contractor, Blackborough Road, Reigate.—The sitting for the adjourned public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Croydon Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Fox.—Mr. T. Britten, Assistant Official Receiver, represented the Board of Trade ; Mr. Braby appeared for the trustee ; and Mr. Hodges for the bankrupt said that before he prepared his statement of affairs no valuation was made of the assets, and to his knowledge none had been made since.
The assets were valued at £2,486.
He meant that he could pay his creditors 20s. in the £.
He thought if they received 12s. in the £ they should be satisfied (laughter).—He believed that he had properly valued his assets.—Mr. Britten offered no opposition to the examination being closed, and Mr. Braby said he had no questions to ask.
The bankrupt was, therefore, allowed to pass his public examination.
FITT, ROBERT, cabinet maker, Curtain Yard, Shoreditch.—The sitting for the bankrupt's public examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hope.
After being examined at some length by the Official Receiver, Mr. E. L. Hough, the trustee (Messrs. Horne & Co., 8, Delahay Street, S.W.), will sell a quantity of mahogany, walnut, and other wood boxes, &c., at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, on the 23rd inst.
