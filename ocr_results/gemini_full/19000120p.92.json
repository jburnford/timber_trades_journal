Beattie.\n---:o:---\nBUILDING & TIMBER TRADES.\n---\nWith the advent of the new year, the building trade has suffered one of those severe shocks which recur every now and again with more or less frequency in the suspension of payment of one of our largest builders, Mr. James Slater, Easter Road, Edinburgh. The liabilities are very heavy, rumour placing it somewhere about £100,000, and as many local firms connected with the building trade are involved, it is feared some may not be able to bear the strain, and that further failures may result. It was generally expected that this year would see a certain diminution in the volume of building operations, as in certain quarters of the city over-building has taken place, the result being a large proportion of unlet property, but it was never anticipated that a shock so severe was to be experienced, and the result will have a very serious effect on the trade. However, if the same is avoided, and the storm bravely we have no doubt that matters will soon rectify themselves, and ere many months are over, things will resume their normal condition. The failure of the City of Glasgow Bank, which caused such widespread ruin in the building trade. Our city is large, and the liabilities are well spread over, not only those connected with the trade, but even engineers, drapers and lawyers being involved. Some of the latter are severely hit, and may not be able to bear the strain. It is gratifying to learn that those in the timber trade have comparatively come out well, and no collapse is expected to result in that quarter. When the state of affairs is published, their claims will amount to not one tenth of the total liabilities, an experience which is seldom felt. No doubt there will be some individual cases of hardship, but this will only affect a very few. Some of the timber merchants most heavily involved will not even find their balance-sheets much, if any the worse, the former year, this thing, below that of being accounted for by the briskness of trade during the past twelve months, accompanied by an advance in prices on stocks held, which will, after all is taken into account, make it an average year. A very short time will suffice to find the timber trade in its usual condition. Panics often occur, not so much among those who are most involved, but among those who have only a remote connection.\n---:o:---\nDUNDEE BUILDING AND WOOD WORKING TRADES.—Although interrupted by the weather, building trade on the whole continued fair during December.

The Sheriff says: It is clear that the injury to the pursuer resulted through his having to conform to the master's direction, but the question remains whether he was bound to so conform. Now, I do not think it necessary under the 3rd sub-Section of Section 1 of the Employers' Liability Act that the person giving the direction should have any general superintendence of either the work or the workmen. I think it can hardly be doubted that the master of any vessel is entitled to direct workmen, requiring access to be on board, both how they are to obtain access to their work on board and how they are to leave it. In the present case he gave pursuer no practical alternative but to comply with his directions. I award pursuer £27 and expenses. Mr. W. Stronach was agent for pursuer, and Mr. Robert Orkney for defenders.",
