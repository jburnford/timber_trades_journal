The following are creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nGardam, Wm, Staines .. .. .. 142 8 9\nLake, William, Staines .. .. .. 52 4 0\nMontgommrey, —Brentford .. .. 29 0 0\nMott, —, Staines .. .. .. .. 10 0 0\nBLADES, WILLIAM ARTHUR, builder, 57, Wellfield Road, Sheffield.—This debtor’s examination was closed on Thursday last week at the Sheffield Bankruptcy Court.\nBEDWORTH, ALFD. CHARLES, builder, lately residing at 47, Crompton Road, Handsworth.—This debtor was examined at the Birmingham Bankruptcy Court on Friday last week. He is 22 years of age, and started business as a builder in 1898, appearing about twelve months later in the Bankruptcy Court with a deficiency of £1,532 17s. in his accounts. Mr. Norris Foster was for the bankrupt, and Mr. Jaques represented the Official Receiver, who is the trustee.—Mr. Jaques, in the course of his examination, elicited from the bankrupt that when he was nineteen years of age he purchased certain property to the amount of £300, but about 12 months afterwards the property was transferred to his mother, Mrs. Hodgetts, who gave him £600 to commence business. Mr. Jaques wanted to get at the ownership of a diamond ring, which bankrupt had stated at the previous examination that he was in the habit of wearing, and Bedworth now said that it belonged to his mother. Bankrupt said he used to work from early morn till late at night.—When Mr. Jaques came down to July last year, the month previous to the bankruptcy, and asked Bedworth if his mother did not tell him that creditors were worrying about money, to which the young bankrupt replied, “No; she objected to people coming there constantly, and said she should not allow it, and should not answer them if they came to the door any more about my affairs.”—Mr. Jaques: Why did you have your mother’s address on your business note-headings? Was it not to represent you as the occupier of that house?—Bankrupt: Certainly not.—In reply to further questions, bankrupt denied that he was now carrying on a timber business at Bewdley, but Mr. Jaques elicited that he was engaged “as a paid servant” by R. Crump and Co. (Limited), timber merchants—a firm in which the chief shareholders were his mother and a Mrs. Crump. He had been officially appointed as manager, he said, at a salary of 30s. a week, but he had no salary for a month past.—Mr. Foster interposed to ask if all this was not irrelevant, and the Registrar cautiously observed that he did not know what it was leading up to.—Mr. Jaques observed to his fellow advocate, “If you want it in a few words, this man is the company; this man is everything.”—“That may be,” returned Mr. Foster, “but you can’t prove it by the way you are going on.”—Mr Jaques returned to the salary question, and asked bankrupt how he had been living of late? He received the reply, “Oh, 30s. a week doesn’t keep me, Mr Jaques.”—Mr Jaques concurred, and suggested that this modest amount would not even pay for the young gentleman’s tobacco, at which several indignant creditors interposed, “Cigars.”—The Official Receiver then took up the role of questioner. At the outset he found it necessary to caution the bankrupt against an\n\n“impudent” use of his (Mr. Sharp’s) name in response to questions. “You say you are working early and late,” he remarked in sarcastic tones, “but that has been no advantage to you. It may have afforded you time to smoke the cigars; but the result of your working early and late has been a loss of £1,600 to your creditors.”—The bankrupt silently assented.—You commenced business in 1898, and you failed in August, 1899, with a deficiency of £1,632?—Yes.—In your amended deficiency account you say you have made no profit on your trading, but sustained a loss of £1,054 1s. 8d.?—Yes.—And you have expended upon yourself in little more than a year £290 17s.?—Yes.—Did you pay anything to your mother for that?—I have not. It went for business purposes.—Would £16 11s. for cigars be for business purposes?—That was not included in that?—I have had to file bankruptcy in £11 worth of Hodgetts, your £522?—That is in thousands of How was that? It was owing to want of time.—It was suggested that the losses in business had been owing to bankrupt’s inexperience, but Bedworth did not concur. He said he had disclosed the whole of the facts, and he had never lost money in gambling.—The examination was then adjourned for the formal signing of the notes.\nBRIGGS, G., builder, Essex Road, East Ham, E.—A sitting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The receiving order was made upon the petition of Mr. J. Byford, of Moody Wharf, Poplar, and the accounts were filed, but the liabilities were estimated at £500, and there are stated to be no assets of any value. Proofs of debt were lodged by :—\n£ s. d.\nNorman, William .. .. .. 33 0 0\nRoberts, Alfred .. .. .. 11 6 5\nTanfe & Evens, Old Broad Street, E.C. 60 1 11\nThe debtor states that he carried on business as a circular sawyer, and began in his own name without capital in Oct., 1893, at 88, Warner Place, Hackney Road. He rented the premises, including power and machinery, paying only the saws, so practically no capital was required, as the work he did was paid for week by week. In November last a private meeting of creditors was held, but the debtor does not know what took place at the meeting. All the timber at his premises belonged to creditors. He attributed his failure to illness and bad trade. A solicitor stated that between the months of October, 1897, and August, 1898, his client, a timber merchant supplied timber to the debtor, and there was still a balance of 400 pieces which had not been delivered back. He now asked the debtor what had become of it. Debtor replied that he had been ill, and it was most likely delivered during his illness; he kept no books so could not say for certain. The solicitor suggested that he had sold it and appropriated the money for his own use; the timber had certainly not been delivered. Debtor denied that he had sold it, and the Official Receiver intimated that he would look into the matter at the sitting which was to be held for the debtor’s public examination on February 14th. He had been adjudicated, and the estate would be wound up in bankruptcy in the usual manner.\nCOLE, WALTER HORACE, builder, 2, Tey Street, Ilford.—The liabilities in this case amount to £1,257 11s. 6d., and the assets are estimated at £30. The following are among the creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nAustin, J. G., Ilford .. .. .. 49 14 2\nBaines, Jno., Epping .. .. .. 10 0 0\nDavis, W., Forest Gate .. .. .. 20 0 0\nDeason, C. & Son, London .. .. 98 19 5\nGray, G.

The statement of affairs shows gross liabilities £700, of which £262 was expected to rank for dividend. From the Official Receiver’s observations, it appears that 2½ years ago debtors, who were bricklayers, commenced business as builders, without any capital. The failure is attributed to trading without capital, and loss on contracts. The average drawings of the partners had not exceeded 10s. a week each. The debtors admitted that since August they had had goods from Tailby & Co., of Birmingham, to the value of £86, for which not a penny had been paid, and £30 was owing for wages. —No offer was made to the creditors, and the estate will be dealt with by the Official Receiver.\nILLINGWORTH, GEORGE ALBERT, builders’ merchant, Shipley, and residing at Lidg[?], Oakworth. The estate of this debtor has been left in the hands of the Official Receiver to be wound up.\nJONES, THOMAS, builder, Hinckley.—The debtor’s examination was closed at Leicester Bankruptcy Court on Friday last.",
