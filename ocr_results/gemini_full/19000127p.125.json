The market being Park, is gradually settling down after the recent disturbances, and there has been more doing this week, but buyers are acting kindly to the large advance. This feeling was reflected in the biddings at the Auction held on Tuesday, by D. W. Beattie, at the Baltic Dock, considerable difficulty being experienced in getting buyers up to the present level. As the exposer was firm, the amount of business done was restricted, and was chiefly in whitewood prices were realised for which the following prices were obtained, viz. :—\nWhite 11 x 3 deals ... 3½d per lin ft\n\" 9 x 3 \" ... 2¾d. \" \"\n\" 8 x 3 \" ... 2d. \" \"\n\" 6½ x 2½ battens ... 2d. \" \"\n\" 6 x 2½ \" ... 1¾d. \" \"\n\" 6 x 2 \" ... 1s 5-16d \" \"\n\" 5 x 2 \" ... 1s 1-16d \" \"\n\" \" \" ... 11d \" \"\n\nJANUARY 27, 1900.

A. Roberston-Durham, C.A., was unanimously appointed trustee.\nThe judicial factor he had prepared the following report :—\n\"The estates were sequestrated by the Lord-Ordinary on 8th January, and the reporter was appointed judicial factor. Since his appointment he has done everything in his power to obtain information to enable him to make up a state of affairs. For many years Mr. James Slater has been engaged in building adventures with other parties, and the judicial factor has found it impossible at this moment to state with anything like accuracy the position of matters in connection with these various adventures. Many of the properties stand in the names of other parties. Deeds have been granted in connection with some of the properties which it will be the duty of the trustee to take steps to reduce. The judicial factor sent out a circular to all the creditors whose names appeared in the books, asking for statements of their claims. A number of creditors have not sent in statements, and possibly because they do not themselves know how accounts stand between them and Mr. Slater. There has been an enormous number of bill transactions, and, so far as the judicial factor has been able to ascertain, there is no less than £70,000 of bills in the circle. In order to provide money to pay the workmen, the judicial factor has rendered a number of accounts, and has kept on a large number of men. He has recovered sufficient funds to pay all the workmen whose wages were past due. He has paid off a large number of the men, and has kept on only such foremen and others as are necessary to look after the jobs on hand. A statement of the judicial factor's intromissions is, as required by the statute, submitted herewith. It is impossible at the present time to form anything approaching even an approximate estimate of what the estate may probably yield.\"\nMost of the properties connected with the joint adventures, Mr. Robertson-Durham added, stood in other peoples names, and it was absolutely necessary that an action should be taken place in connection with them before it could be ascertained how Mr. Slater really stood. He had had search made of deeds put upon record since 10th November last. His own belief was that these deeds must be reduced, and that there would be no opposition in connection with them. As to the nature of these, Mr. Robertson-Dunham intimated five deeds which were denominated declarations of trust in favour of Mr. J. Campbell Irons, four of them being dated 3rd, and recorded 4th January, 1900, four days before the sequestration, and the fifth dated and recorded on 5th January, 1900. He said he did not want to mention anything in any name that perhaps should not be mentioned at that stage, and he gave these as an indication of deeds put on record immediately before sequestration with the intention of endeavouring to give security where perhaps security should not have been given. (Hear, hear.) He could assure them that the whole matters was exceedingly involved, and would require a very great amount of trouble to unravel. Knowing what he did, he had thought it prudent and expedient at that moment not to put before the creditors any detailed state of affairs which would be incomplete and incorrect, and in which he would possibly have mentioned a name or names which it would not be fair to mention until he knew exactly how matters stood. Mr. Slater himself had, as he was required to do, made up a state of affairs which he (the trustee) was not in any way responsible for, and which he could not vouch for in any way. It was as follows:—Heritable property and interest in joint adventures impossible to estimate at present; workshops, office, and ground, £4,500; stock-in-trade, £2,000—£2,500; bonds valued at £7,000; machinery and plant at Easter Road and Morningside Road, £1,900; plant at various contracts, £2,100; amount due on sundry contracts, valued at £1,272; amount due on open account estimated at £4,831 15s. 6d.; stocks and shares, £5,536 £10 (Mr. Robertson-Durham was afraid that had merely a nominal value); policies of assurance, estimated at £100; household furniture, at Lyon & Turnbull's valuation, £198 9s. 6d.; total, £25,458 15s. Liabilities—Wages, £200; sums due in respect of bills and on open account, £65,589 3s. 10d.; amount due in cash credits and personal bonds, £14,150; total, £79,939 3s. 10d.\nMr. Mitchell, Mr. Thomas S. Pearson, and Mr. Cossar Mackenzie were appointed commissioners on the estate.\nThe Chairman said he had gone over the stock books very carefully, and considered it exceedingly moderately valued. That was an item amounting to about £7,000, so that, if the other items detailed by Mr. Slater were anything approximating to its correctness, the statement of the assets should be fairly reliable.\nA vote of thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings.\n\n:o:\n\nIMPORTS.\nABERDEEN.\nJan. 22 Minsk (s)—Fredrikstad—566 lds. fire-wood—C.

Hitherto a great drawback in conection with diamond saws has been the cost involved by the losing of diamonds, but Mr. Anderson has devised a means by which the precious stones are prevented from dropping out. The principle adopted is that of fixing by electricity. The diamonds are dropped into small holes bored into steel sockets, and the sockets are then placed into an electric welding machine, with the result that the diamonds have a compact mass of metal sealed around them. The saw is 5-ft. in diameter, and in its periphery 126 sockets are inserted at intervals of 1¼-in, 12 being in the centre and 42 at each side. At a recent test, the saw made 560 revolutions per minute, and on two occasions it cut a stone 4-ft. 8-in. long in less than 5-min, this being at the rate of a little more than 5-in. per minute; but a much higher speed can be developed.\n\n:o:\n\nFIRE IN GLASGOW.\nA destructive fire broke out on Saturday last, in the shipbuilding establishment of A. Rodgers & Co., Port Glasgow. The fire originated in the joiners' shop, and spread with alarming rapidity to the saw mills, the polishing, blockmakers' and engineering departments, despite the efforts of the fire brigade, who had an abundant supply of water. The whole of these buildings, consisting of three flats, 200 feet by 60 feet, were completely destroyed, along with a fire-proof wall. The drawing offices, private offices and counting office, were saved with considerable difficulty, but during the operations two firemen were dangerously injured by falling timbers. The damages are estimated at £12,000.\n\n:o:\n\nNEW COMPANY.—The South Glasgow Fryery Corporation Limited, has been registered, with a capital of £70,000 in £1 shares (35,000 five per cent cumulative preference), to adopt an agreement with William Hill, 141, West George Street, Glasgow, and to carry on the business of builders, feuars, &c. The offices of the new company are at Baltic Chambers, 50, Wellington Street, Glasgow.\n\nINVERNESS.—A block of buildings 210 feet long and four storeys high, is to be built in Church Street and Queensgate, Inverness, at an estimated cost of £25,000. Mr. W. L. Carruthers of Union Street, Inverness, is the architect.\n\n:o:\n\nAN INDIAN RELIC.\nThe place of honour in the city office of the Ottawa Lumber Company at Ottawa is given to a rusted and battered tomahawk. This was secured in the heart of a 2½in. pine log, and judging from the workmanship of the hatchet, and the size of the log itself, the hatchet must have lain in the log for 75 years, having probably been imbedded when the tree was a mere sapling. On either side of the tomahawk can be noticed the marks where the wood had apparently eaten well into the wood.",
