GALASHIELS.—DEATH OF MR. ADAM STIRLING, BUILDER.—Mr. Adam Stirling, Builder, Galashiels, died on Friday evening, the 8th inst., after an illness of about two months. He was widely known in the building trade, and in some departments had attained a high reputation for skill and superior workmanship. He paid special attention to the construction of conservatories, and was employed in the erection of vineries on the most extensive scale and improved plans, such as those at Floors Castle and the Tweed vineries of Mr. Thomson at Clovenford. For some years Mr. Stirling had a seat at the Council Board, and in the discharge of his duties showed great judgment and prudence. He will be much missed both in the trade and the social circle.—Scotsman.
