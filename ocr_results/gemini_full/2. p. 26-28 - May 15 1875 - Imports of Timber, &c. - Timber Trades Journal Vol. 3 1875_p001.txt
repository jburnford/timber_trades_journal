28 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. [MAY 15, 1875.

most part have undertaken work which must be finished by the Whit-sunday term, and they consequently could not help themselves.
The joiners at Greenock are on strike at present, making similar demands for an advance of wages; but meantime the masters maintain a firm attitude, chiefly against such requests of the men as an allowance of three hours for sharpening tools when leaving one employer to go to another, &c., &c.
In reference to the state of the timber trade in this quarter, I cannot report at present any favourable or encouraging prospect of business.
At a term time working jobs must be finished; but on more solid grounds there does not seem to be much likelihood of a large or prosperous trade being done in this neighbourhood for some time to come.

LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.)
May 13th, 1875.
Importations of wood goods in the Firth have been on the increase since my last communication.
Say, seven cargoes battens, three cargoes staves, four cargoes squares, and sixteen cargoes pit props.
There have been three sales during last fortnight, consisting of battens, deals and various timber.
The prices throughout were very low, and cannot be quoted as fair market prices.
I regret to have to announce the failure of Mr. A. R. Rennie, an extensive importer of battens and timber generally, a gentleman highly esteemed in this locality.
I am not aware of any sales to take place for some time, except Messrs. Thomson's on the 18th, which has already been duly noticed.
Freights from the Baltic, &c., remain unchanged, and no demand for tonnage.

NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE.
(From our own Correspondent.)
May 13th, 1875.
Since date of my last letter there is little change to report in the state of the timber trade.
The arrival of goods, principally common battens from Norway, has been numerous, and seem to have found a ready market.
Old stocks have now almost disappeared, so that what is now sold will be turned over at a profit.
The prospects of a very busy season in almost every branch of trade are unusually good; and now that prices in Norway and Sweden have apparently seen their lowest, we fully anticipate larger sales and more general activity among timber buyers.
At the Tyne Dock, yesterday, a considerable quantity of deals, battens, and boards, principally the property of London merchants.
The attendance was exceedingly small, the bidding very languid, and only a very small quantity changed hands.
