The Gardner Process of Seasoning and Preserving Timber.
At the last meeting of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, Mr. Deas, C.E., read a paper on “The Gardner process of seasoning and preserving timber from decay.” It was claimed for this process—1, that it seasons timber of all descriptions more thoroughly and rapidly than any natural or artificial processes at present in use; 2, that while thoroughly seasoning timber, it also preserves it from decay; 3, that by impregnating timber with a certain solution it can be further fortified against decay; 4, that the timber by similar means can be made invulnerable to all worms and insects; 5, in a similar manner it can be rendered non-inflammable; 6, it strengthens the timber; and 7, that by it timber can be permanently stained and coloured to a variety of shades. It was stated that it was only eighteen months since experiments were made outside of the firm’s own works in Glasgow, where it has been in use for three or four years. By a chemical process the sap was dissolved, and then the moisture left in the timber was drawn out, the whole operation only taking from four to fourteen days, according to the density and bulk of the timber so operated on. Specimens of prepared timber used as pit props were exhibited, which after being down ten months were taken up quite sound, while a prop without the process was considerably decayed. Another experiment had been made with a prepared sleeper put into the tunnel of the North British Railway at Queen-street alongside of others prepared in the usual manner. It was found that the sleeper which had been submitted to the Gardner process was quite fresh after the others had shown signs of decay. The paper also referred to the excellent results which had been obtained from the prepared timber in the cabinet work of Messrs. A. Gardner and Sons and in other cases; and pointed out the advantages which were to be gained by its use over wood in its natural state. Some shavings of the ordinary wood were burned in presence of the meeting, while shavings rendered non-inflammable by the process could not be burned.
In the course of discussion Mr. John Jex Long mentioned that the extracting of resinous matter from wood was not new, as he did it regularly himself, and a patent had been taken out by a gentleman in London for rendering lucifer matches non-inflammable after having been burned for a certain length. Dr. Wallace expressed his regret that the society had not been told more about what the process really was, but perhaps if it was not patented that could scarcely be looked for.

SPRUCE TIMBER.—Some time ago Mr. C. Graham Smith read a very able paper before the Liverpool Polytechnic Society, on the different varieties of pine and fir timber, remarking on their respective qualifications for engineering purposes, &c., extracts of which were published in the Timber Trades Journal of the 3rd of March last.
I am sorry to observe some of Mr. Smith’s remarks on spruce timber.
He says,—
“Spruce being strong, tough, and straight-grained, forms an excellent material for temporary work. When exposed to the weather it cannot be depended upon to stand more than five or six years, unless kept properly painted, or otherwise protected; and when employed in the construction of houses it is extremely liable to rot if in contact with warm damp atmosphere.” Some of the foregoing remarks are diametrically opposite to my own experience relative to the durability of spruce timber for various purposes; and I consider that such remarks expressed by a gentleman of Mr. Smith’s position and experience are apt to bring spruce timber into disrepute. Thirty-two years ago an extensive farm steading was to be built upon this estate, and it was then determined that the roofing of the byres and stables was to be of spruce, being considered the best kind of roofing to resist the hot damp atmosphere arising from the breath of cattle and horses. I supplied the spruce roofing from sound timber perfectly free from rot. Yesterday I examined carefully and minutely the state of the roofing. The byre is generally occupied with from forty to forty-five milch cows, and the stable with eight horses. I found the roofing of these as fresh and hard as possible, and judging from present appearance they may stand good till they arrive at a hundred years of age. It is a well-known fact over my employer’s estates, that spruce timber is admirably adapted for roofing byres and stables. From the tops of the spruce trees that supplied the roofing for the above steading I got bars cut for erecting an upright paling around my garden. The posts and horizontal rails were of sound larch, and the upright bars were of spruce. This upright paling with little repairs has stood proof against hares and rabbits for twenty-one years. I could enumerate many other purposes for which spruce timber is admirably adapted, as well as for the foregoing purposes.—W. McCorquodale, in “Journal of Forestry.”
