It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.\"—*Civil Service Gazette*.—Made simply with boiling water or milk.

The sitting for public examination was held at the Salisbury Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, the 2nd inst. The Official Receiver (Mr. F. Aston Dawes) represented the estate, but the debtor, however, did not put in an appearance. After waiting it was decided to adjourn the examination until February 13th, and the Registrar intimated that he should report to the Judge the absence of the debtor. It appears that the debtor lately had something like £100 more in his possession than he has accounted for. The debtor pleads that he had paid £13 for rates and a considerable sum for money. The adjourned first meeting is on the 8th inst.\n\nH. S. RIBBANDS.—A private meeting of the creditors of the debtor, who trades as a timber merchant at 40, Myrtle Street, Hoxton, London, N., was held on Monday last at the Guildhall Coffee House, Gresham Street. A statement of affairs was presented, and the debtor made an offer of 15s. in the pound. The proceedings were adjourned to see if the debtor could obtain guarantees for the payment of the composition, and to lay the proposal before all the creditors, many of whom were absent from the meeting.\n\nG. PRYOR.—A first meeting was last week held before Mr. Stewart, Assistant Receiver, last week in the case of George Pryor, of May Villa, Wightman's Road, Hornsey, builder. The receiving order was made on December 4th, upon the petition of Mr. F. Paine, lath-render, Wellington Street, Shacklewell, and the debtor furnished a statement of affairs showing unsecured debts £1,953 8s., and debts fully secured £5,945; with assets, £641 10s., comprising an estimated surplus from securities of £515.

His books did not sufficiently disclose his business transactions and financial position. Various proofs of debt having been admitted, the debtor was examined by Mr. E. Foreman and Mr. Ward on behalf of creditors, and it appeared that his assets were over-valued, and were not likely to realize more than £150. In reply to the Chairman, the debtor said that he would offer 4s. in the pound, payable in four quarterly instalments. Mr. Hun. Hawker, the largest unsecured creditor, said that he had always found the debtor a very honest man, and had great faith in him. He should accept the offer if the composition were properly secured. The debtor said he believed that he could find security, and his proposal was accepted, subject to the composition being secured to the satisfaction of Mr. E. Foreman, of the Timber Trades Association, 57, Grace-\n\nchurch Street. The meeting for public examination stands for the 22nd inst.\n\nJ. EBERHARD.—The debtor filed his petition on November 26th, describing himself as of 15 & 17, Edward Street, 165, Hampstead Road, and 17, Robert's Mews, parquet floor manufacturer and cabinet joiner, trading under the style of J. Eberhard & Co.; and the first meeting of creditors took place last week, before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £1,490 15s. 1d., and assets at £427 7s. 4d., after deducting preferential payments. The following were returned as creditors:—\n£ s. d\nBurch J. D., 13, Rutland Street, N.W.... ... 175 2 0\nBurton J., 195, Old Kent Street, E.C.... ... 57 16 5\nFourdrinier D., Catherine Street, W.C. ... 36 7 0\nGedge & Co., St. John Street, E.C. ... ... 127 3 9\nHopkinson & Prince, Walbrook... ... ... 43 16 9\nLa Construction Industrielle, Brussels ... ... 14 10 11\nMeulch Emma, Camden Town ... ... ... 87 2 6\nOliver & Sons, Bunhill Row ... ... ... 52 10 8\nParry & Co., Camden Town ... ... ... 10 0 0\nQuatman —, Queen Victoria Street ... ... 16 6 8\nReed W., 175, Strand ... ... ... ... 150 18 10\nSage F., Gray's Inn Road... ... ... ... 157 8 0\nTaylor Maria, College Place, N.W. ... ... 13 0 0\nTyler T., timber merchant, Bonny St., N.W. 10 3 6\nWhite & Son, Oxford Street ... ... ... 12 17 5\nWitt & Palmer, Drummond Street, N.W. ... 32 8 0\nYoung & Shadbolt, West India Docks ... ... 56 0 0\n\nThe Official Receiver reported that the debtor attributed his failure and deficiency to bad debts, to losses arising from severe competition and from the stoppage of his work for two months during repairs to boiler, to loss from purchase of timber, which proved to be decayed, and to depreciation in the value of his assets as estimated for realization. The debtor had kept books which appeared to have been balanced to March last, but since that date they had not been properly written up. The plant, machinery, stock and trade effects had been valued for realization at £310. The Court had made an order for the summary administration of the estate. Mr. Serjeant, on behalf of the debtor, offered a composition of 5s. in the pound, but payment not being secured to the satisfaction of the creditors, an adjudication of bankruptcy was resolved upon, and Mr. G. N. Read, accountant, Queen Victoria Street, was appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection. The meeting for public examination is fixed for the 16th inst.\n\nC. H. RICHARDSON, builder, Alice Road, Romford Road, E.—In this case (noticed last week) the following are scheduled as creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBoulcott Joseph & Co., Limehouse ... ... 46 8 6\nBlake Mrs., Forest Lane, E. ... ... ... 30 0 0\nChapman R., Stratford New Town ... ... 45 0 0\nHarris W.

SMITH.—The suspension of Mr. Arthur Smith, of Commercial Works, Rotherhithe, of Albany Road, Camberwell, and of St. Margaret's, Twickenham, builder and contractor, is announced. Mr. Smith has been extensively engaged for some years past in building operations in Camberwell, Twickenham, Clapton, Wimbledon, and other suburban districts. The total liabilities are believed to amount to about £170,000, of which about £24,000 will rank for dividend. Hopes were until the last day or two entertained that the matter might be arranged without bankruptcy proceedings, and a committee of the principal creditors was recently appointed with that object, but the action of a few of their number rendered an application to the Court inevitable. Messrs. Lawrance, Plews, & Baker are the solicitors in the matter, and by direction of the committee on Tuesday last they obtained the appointment of Mr. Mollett (assistant secretary to one of the firms most largely interested) as special manager. The cause of the failure appears to have been the continued depression in trade and the too rapid development of properties.\n\nJOHN YEATES MARGISON.—The debtor, who was formerly a timber merchant, traded as an auctioneer and valuer at Hull. His examination took place in the Hull Bankruptcy Court on Monday last. In reply to the Official Receiver, Mr. Margison said that he was formerly a timber merchant in partnership with his brother, but he left that business in 1869. He took over the liabilities and paid his brother £1,000. His Honour, referring to the statement of affairs, said that he under-",
