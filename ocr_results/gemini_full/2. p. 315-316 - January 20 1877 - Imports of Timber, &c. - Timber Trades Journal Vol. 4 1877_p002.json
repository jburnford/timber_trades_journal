Beyond such opportunities as were offered to dispose of charter room, New York has had no connection with the movement; yet, as a matter of more or less moment to all lumbermen, we have endeavoured to obtain a few points upon the subject. Naturally where a business remains in an experimental condition—and the trade in deals of the United States must as yet be so considered—those engaged are quite indifferent about communicating information, and we have been unable to accomplish anything very brilliant. So far as our report goes, how-ever, it can be relied upon as coming from a source positively authorita-tive.\nThe primary causes leading to the shipment of white pine deals can clearly be traced; first to the ruling low rates and a disposition among manufacturers to at all times treat liberally with cash buyers, which, of course, more operating on foreign account must be considered; and second, by the cheapness of transportation, lake and rail, to the sea-board, supplemented by easy ocean freight charges. Having carefully canvassed the position, a Canadian concern, with the leaven of Yankeeism, in the person of a member from St. Louis, commenced the experiment late last winter by contracting for a few million feet of deals, and as they became better informed generally, they branched out more largely until finally when the season closed they had handled some-where in the neighbourhood of 35,000,000 feet, board measure. Of this amount some eight or ten vessel loads were sent direct from loading points to European ports, and with one exception had a speedy and successful voyage; about 2,000,000 feet, board measure, went to Quebec, and the balance was shipped via Amherstburg, Ontario, and Canada Southern R. R. to New York, and thence by three or four specially chartered vessels abroad. On the first of last month there was still left at Amherstburg probably 10,000,000 feet, cross-piled and drying for early spring shipment. These deals are simply three-inch plank of two grades, the standard size being twelve feet long and eleven inches wide, claimed to be of better quality in timber, and largely better in average grade than has been shipped from Canada in many years. They are purchased by board measure, but shipped and sold on the other side by either the Quebec or Petersburg standard. The former represents 2,750 feet, and the latter 1,980 feet, board measure. The annual value of the deals shipped last session will not vary greatly from 35 dols. per M feet, board measure, in New York, and it is estimated that ocean freight will average about 90 shillings per standard. The first\n\ninto arriving were forward by steamers, but the companies took no interest in the matter, and the deals were handled so carelessly as to be more or less injured. For two or three months also the clearance papers were made out in a somewhat bungling manner, which prevented a proper classification upon the Government books, but through the efforts of our custom officers this has since been rectified, and in future deals will appear under their proper heading. Through the courtesy and with the assistance of the head of the proper bureau in our custom-house, we have carefully analyzed the clearances, and find that the ship-ments of deals from the port of New York for the year 1876 will aggre-gate about 23,100,000 feet, including some lots other than those referred to above. As the exact figures for December are at the present writing not as yet fully compiled, there may be a slight error—a shortage if anything,—but the above aggregate is substantially correct.\nAs to the continuation of this movement, nothing at the moment appears to be known. So many contingencies have to be considered, the way of transportation charges, inland and ocean, and the wants of the foreign markets, that operators are loth to proceed, except with great caution, and little has been done as yet in the way of contract-ing for supplies. Our western exchanges seem to indicate a desire to cut this class of stock, and also ability to furnish large quantities, while the Canadians contend that the Michigan pineries will never turn out quality or quantity to satisfy the foreign call, and in one instance have tried to figure the American forest out of existence, within a remarkably short space of time. Our neighbours across the line have evidently made the acquaintance of that monster sporting the green lined optic, and are desirous of throwing cold water on a project which promises to make serious inroads into a portion of the lumber business they have heretofore considered their sole preroga-tive.\n\nCHICAGO.\n(From the “North-western Lumberman,” December 25th.)\nThe business for the month of December is stated to have been in most cases equal, and in some in excess of the amount transacted during the corresponding week of 1875. This feature of the trade it would seem ought to encourage the dealers and be productive of a cheerful feeling, though it cannot be said that such is the case. The reason for this is found in the fact that it is always more or less dull at this season of the year, and the operators regard it as their manifest duty to complain whether they have reason for so doing or not.\nWere it not for the scarcity of money throughout the country, the trade from interior points would doubtless be unusually brisk. The roads in nearly every interior section supplied from this market are in a most excellent condition, and apparently nothing is wanting to start up a good trade among the country dealers but the ability on the part of the farmers to buy.\n\nSAGINAW VALLEY.\n(From the “Lumberman’s Gazette,” December 20th.)\nPrincipal attention is now being directed toward logging matters, and all of our operators are providing for full stocks. The fall has been an especially favourable one for work in the woods, and everything is well advanced—most of the teams have been experienced in all portions of the State a large number of teams have been put in the banking of quite a large number of logs. Though there has not been snow enough as yet to make comfort-able hauling, still the boss loggers have ordered the teams on in many locali-ties, for the purpose of making a good smooth bottom, which will make the roads all the better hereafter.\n\nTHE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.\n(From the “Lumberman and Manufacturer.”)\nThe weather thus far gives promise of a long season’s haul to the loggers of the north-west, who are now getting fairly under way, cutting, and, in most localities, hauling on a fair amount of snow, the reports showing that, with the continuance of favourable weather, the cut will be larger than any of the estimates which have been made so far; for the operators in the woods have at least three weeks’ start of the usual hauling time, and over a month ahead of the last winter’s cutting, but there is now no probability of doubling up with teams and men in January.\n\nThe Gazette.\nADJUDICATIONS OF BANKRUPTCY.\nBrown, Goodman, 27, Kensington Park-road, Notting Hill, builder and zinc-worker.
