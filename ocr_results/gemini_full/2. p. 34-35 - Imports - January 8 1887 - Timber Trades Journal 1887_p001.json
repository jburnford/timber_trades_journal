The gross liabilities were £5,896 12s. 5d., of which £5,533 4s. 10d. are expected to rank, and the assets estimated at £73 12s. 9d. The principal creditors are:—\nHawes W., Stroud Green Road, N. ... ...\nHowell S., Blackstock Road, N. ... ...\nHunter J., 119, Seven Sisters Road ... ...\nSpooner Henry, Hornsey Road ... ...\nThomas W., Seven Sisters Road, N. ... ...\nFULLY SECURED.\nHawken C., North Street, Wandsworth ...\nArnott G., Charlton ... ... ...\nLIABILITIES LIST \"D.\"\nUnder this head the debtor makes the following entry:—\"I am liable for certain mortgages in which I acted merely as the nominee of Mr. Henry Adolphus Phillips, of Finsbury Park, timber merchant, and I estimate my liability under the mortgages at £5,000.\" The following are the Official Receiver's observations:—\n\"The debtor states that he commenced building in 1880, with a capital of £300, on building material, on Woodbury Lodge Estate, Stamford-ham, under an agreement with Mr. Phillips, by whom he was financed; and that in 1882 he paid a composition under a private arrangement with his creditors, on debts amounting to about £1,000. Further, that in the year 1884, he recommenced building (without capital) at Hermitage Road, Tottenham, and later on at Eade Road, Tottenham, and was financed by the same person, and that this person's stoppage, the debtor attributes his failure. The debtor has not kept any proper books of account, and is apparently unable to give any explanation of his financial position, and interest in respect of the various properties (many of which are unfinished), beyond that they are fully mortgaged; that the mortgagees are in possession in every case, and that there is no realisable surplus equities. The security held by'creditors returned as fully secured is stated to be a charge on the debtor's leasehold house, 1A, Eade Road, Holloway, the value being estimated at the amount of the claims (£344 1s. 6d.), and on stock-in-trade, &c., which had been seized under an execution, was sold with his consent, and that they are no realisable assets, beyond £65 15s. 6d., subject to expenses of the sale. The debtor on his consent has been adjudged bankrupt.\" In the absence of a quorum of creditors no resolution was passed. An order for summary administration has been made, and the debtor having been already adjudged bankrupt, the Official Receiver will wind up the estate.\nASTRUP THOMAS, timber merchant, 25, Lombard Street, E.C.—On Wednesday a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Giffard under a petition presented by the debtor to Messrs. Phipps, Wright and Co., of Melbourne. The act of bankruptcy alleged was the failure of the debtor to comply with the terms of a bankruptcy notice. Nothing transpired with reference to liabilities and probable assets.\nBALDOCK, WILLIAM, builder, Tunbridge Green.—A meeting of the creditors of this debtor was convened at Messrs. Spencer and Reeves' offices, on Friday week, under the presidency of Mr. Cully, the Deputy Official Receiver, but only one creditor, Mr. Carey, put in an appearance. The debtor's statement of affairs showed his net liabilities to be £196, and assets £95. Although the debtor states that his stock-in-trade and furniture are worth £95, Messrs. Spence & Reeves, the Official Receiver's agents, only value it at £35, and as the debtor owes £16 for rent, there will thus be nothing for the creditors. The creditors are:—\nCarey & Co., timber merchants, Tunbridge Wells ... ... ... ... ...\nChambers, Monnery & Co., ironmongers, Bishopsgate Street, London ... ...\nFinnemore W., ironmonger, Cranbrook, Sussex ... ... ... ... ...",
