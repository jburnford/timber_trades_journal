LIABILITIES LIST “D.”
Under this head the debtor makes the following entry :—“I am liable upon certain mortgages in which I acted merely as the nominee of Mr. Henry Adolphus Wickes, of Finsbury Park, timber merchant. . . . I estimate my liability under the mortgages at £5,000.” The following are the Official Receiver’s observations :—
“The debtor states that he commenced building in 1880, with a capital of £300 in cash and material, on Woodbury Lodge Estate, Tottenham, under an agreement with a person by whom he was financed ; and that in 1883 he paid a composition under a private arrangement with his creditors on debts amounting to about £1,000. Further, that in January, 1884, he recommenced building (without capital) at Hermitage Road, Tottenham, and later on at Eade Road, Stoke Newington, financed by the same person, and to this person’s stoppage, the debtor attributes his failure. The debtor has not kept any proper books of account, and is apparently unable to give any explanation of his affairs, position, and interest in respect of the various properties (many of which are unfinished), beyond that they are fully mortgaged, that the mortgagees are in possession in every case, and that there is no realisable value in the equities. The security held by creditors treated as fully secured is stated to be mortgages on the debtor’s leasehold house, 1A, Russell Road, Holloway, the value being estimated at the amount of the claims (£344 1s. 8d.). The stock-in-trade, &c., which had been seized under an execution, was sold with the concurrence of the Official Receiver, and realised £65 15s. 6d., subject to expenses of levy and sale. The debtor on his consent has been adjudged bankrupt.” In the absence of a quorum of creditors no resolution was passed. An order for summary administration had been made, and the debtor having been already adjudged bankrupt, the Official Receiver will wind up the estate.
ASTRUP THOMAS, timber merchant, 58, Lombard Street, E.C.—On Wednesday a receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Giffard under a petition presented against the debtor by Messrs. Phipps, Turnbull & Co., of Melbourne. The act of bankruptcy alleged was the failure of the debtor to comply with the terms of a bankruptcy notice. Nothing transpired with reference to the liabilities and probable assets.
BALDOCK, WILLIAM, builder, Hurst Green.—A meeting of the creditors of this debtor was convened at Messrs. Spence & Reeves’ offices, on Friday week, under the presidency of Mr. Cully, the Deputy Official Receiver, but only one creditor, Mr. Carey, was in an appearance. The debtor’s statement of affairs showed his net liabilities to be £127 10s., and assets £35. Although the debtor states that his stock-in-trade and furniture are worth £35, Messrs. Spence & Reeves, the Official Receiver’s agents, only value it at £14, and as the debtor owes £16 for rent, there will really be nothing for the creditors. The creditors are :—

BISHOP, HENRY, builder, of Putney.—The public examination of this debtor has been fixed for the Wandsworth Court, on the 27th inst. Meanwhile Mr. Cecil Mercer, the Official Receiver, of Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W., has just issued the preliminary details to the creditors. These contain a summary of the debtors statement of affairs, showing gross liabilities, £6,691 11s. 4d.; unsecured creditors, £1,405 11s. 5d.; creditors fully secured, £5,278 17s. 11d.; estimated value of securities, £6,275 leaving a surplus to go to the other side of £996 12s. 1d.; total liabilities expected to rank against the estate for dividend, £1405 11s. 5d.; Assets, stock-in-trade, building plant, &c., £65; book debts, £80; the surplus previously mentioned from the securities in the hands of the creditors fully secured, £996 12s. 1d. Deduct £7 2s. 6d. preferential claims, leaving net available assets, £1,134 9s. 7d. Deficiency, £271 1s. 10d. The Official Receiver states that the receiving order was made on the 18th December on the debtor’s own petition, and that he (the debtor) attributes his insolvency to insufficient capital, losses on contracts and buildings, and inability to realise his property. He, however, gives no detailed account of his deficiency, and the books which have been handed over to the Official Receiver (prime cost books for each job) do not, in that gentleman’s opinion, sufficiently disclose that debtor’s financial position and business transactions within the three years immediately preceding his bankruptcy. He (the debtor) states that he commenced business in or about 1875, with a capital of £150, and that he became aware of his insolvency about July, 1886, and has contracted several debts since that date. The Official Receiver, in his report, says that the securities held by the creditors fully secured consist of mortgages upon Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, Santos Road, Wandsworth, and Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6, Byne Road, Penge; and house, yard, workshop, and premises, 118, Disraeli Road, Putney. The Beckenham Local Board have a charge upon the four houses at Penge, for paving work executed by them. The debtor admits that in October, 1883, he filed his petition for liquidation, and that the creditors accepted a composition of 6s. in the pound, and that this was paid within seven days of the offer being confirmed. At the close of his report, Mr. Mercer (the Official Receiver) says that he is of opinion that the debtor ought to be called upon to render every detailed deficiency and cash accounts for the two years immediately preceding his bankruptcy; and that on reference to the item, “surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured, £996 12s. 1d.,” it would be probably found that this surplus had been greatly overestimated, and would not realise anything like the amount set down by the debtor, and that probably, also, his “building plant, &c., £65,” would not realise the amount. We last week published a list of creditors. The first meeting of creditors is fixed for next week.
BRAGG, H., builder, Stralock Terrace, Parsons Green, S.W.—A receiving order was made by Mr. Registrar Giffard on Thursday under a petition presented against the debtor by Eastwood & Co. (Limited), of Belvedere Road, S.E. The debtor was examined, and it appeared that his available assets were of small value.
CREASER, HENRY, and ROBERT CREASER, joiners and builders, carrying on business at 5½, The Crescent, Blossom Street, York.—The statement of affairs in this matter is as follows:—Liabilities to unsecured creditors £924 4s. 10d., to creditors fully secured £3,069 5s. 6d., less estimated value of securities £3,757 8s., surplus to contra £688 2s. 6d., total £924 4s. 10d. Assets; By stock-in-trade, estimated cost £15, estimated to realise £14 6s., book debts (good) £85 2s. 6d., surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured £688 2s. 6d., total £787 11s., less preferential creditors for rent, rates, taxes, wages, &c., payable in full £44 5s. 8d., leaving net assets £743 5s. 4d., and a deficiency of £180 19s. 6d. The debtors attribute their failure to difficulty in disposing of property, and having to borrow money upon interest, owing to their capital being locked up in property and losses by unprofitable contracts. The Official Receiver’s observations are:—The debtors commenced business as joiners and builders in July, 1885, with a capital of £50. It was understood that the partners should be on equal terms. They have not kept proper books of account. Their chief business has

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 7
been the building of small houses on speculation mainly of twenty-five houses, which are in mortgage for £2,910 for principal and £99 5s. 6d. for interest. These houses are let at about £4s. per week, and the debtors estimate that they are worth £688 2s. 6d. more than the amounts taken between them about £3 10s. per week out of the business for personal expenses. The debtors previous to filing their own petition had been adjudged bankrupts. The following are creditors :—

FLEMING, THOMAS.—In this matter, previously reported, a second meeting of creditors was held at the offices of the Official Receiver on Friday, at which a resolution was passed confirming those passed at the first meeting, to the effect that the scheme of arrangement by which the debtor is to pay a dividend of 20s. in the pound be paid by the debtor within a period of six months from the date of approval by the Court of the scheme, together with the costs, charges, and expenses of these proceedings, be accepted. Mr. George Aylen, of Landport, public accountant, is the trustee, and Mr. William Pelham, of Blackfriars Road. Southsea, merchant, Mr. William Richard Cowan, 14, Montgomerie Road, Southsea, merchants’ clerk (clerk to Mr. Henry Moody, timber merchant, Landport), and Mr. George Loney, of Cumberland Street, Portsea, monetary agent, are to constitute the committee of inspection, for the purpose of superintending the administration of the debtor’s property by the trustee. The debtor proposes to consolidate his estate, and to obtain an advance sufficient to carry out this scheme o arrangement. Negotiations for this loan have been in progress for some months past, and it is alleged are now ripe for completion. The scheme proposed does not carry debtor’s discharge unless the creditors are paid in full.
FORD, HENRY, builder and contractor, Tisbury, Wilts.—The first meeting of the creditors of this debtor was held on Thursday at the offices of the Official Receiver (Mr. F. Aston Dawes), Salisbury, Mr. Dawes presiding.

The Official Receiver, in his observations, said he should require an amended deficiency account, as no effort appeared to have been made to supply details of the losses, &c. The debtor commenced business in 1878 or 1879
