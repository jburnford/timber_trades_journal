LEITH.
There is still no great pressure of arrivals of wood goods to record, but there must now be a considerable number of cargoes on the way to this port from all parts of the Baltic, the bulk of which may be expected to arrive shortly.
Business in selling goods is steady but quiet, in sympathy with the state of trade generally, which always tells on the consumption of wood, and unfortunately there is no immediate prospect of improvement.
There was a public sale held on Tuesday by Messrs. A. Garland & Roger, but it was chiefly a clearance sale of old balances of stock and oddments, which were exposed without reserve to clear out their yard. A start was made with cut yellow pine boards, which were all cleared out, and then the more miscellaneous lots were taken up, and mostly all disposed of, but the actual quantity got through was not large. I give you some of the principal prices obtained, but of course they are no fair criterion of values of fresh bright goods:—
Cut yellow pine boards, 2d. per sup. foot for ¾in. average.
Cut mahogany boards, 3d. per sup. foot for ¾in. average.
6½ x 2½ red battens (Lulea), short lengths, ⅞d. to 1p[?]d. per lin. foot.
6½ x 2½ white battens (Drontheim), 3rds, ¾d. to 1d. per lin. foot.
5 x 2 white battens (Namsos), 3rds, ⅝d. per lin. foot.
4 x 2 white battens (Namsos), 3rds, 7/8d. per lin. foot.
9 x 3 white deals (Riga), 2nds, 1½d. per lin. ft.

STATELY old dame (housekeeper), during absence of the family, showing the bed Queen Elizabeth slept in.—Visitor: "Is it bona fide?" Dame (bridling): "No, Sir, Hinglish Hoak."
BRITISH COLUMBIA.—A telegram dated the 1st of June says :—" Signs of trouble are manifesting themselves in British Columbia. A recent Order in Council imposes heavy dues on Dominion timber, and otherwise regulates lumbering. The residents on the Pacific coast consider this a breach of faith and destructive of that industry. The newspapers there excitedly and pointedly declare that the integrity of the Dominion is endangered."
