Hastings ... ... 1570 4 2\nWILLIAM HENRY STEER, of 29, Broomwood Road, Wandsworth Common.—The first meeting of the creditors in this case was held on the 1st inst. at the offices of the Official Receiver for the district, 109, Victoria Street, Westminster, Mr. H. Shirtcliffe presiding. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £2,044 16s., to creditors fully secured £15,905, and the value of the security held by them is estimated at £19,945, thus creating a surplus of £4,040. Preferential claims payable in full, £182 12s. The assets are plant, £100; book debts, £91 2s. 1d.; cash, £1 16s. 3d.; furniture, £50; other property (consisting of two £10 shares fully paid up in the Artisans', Labourers' and General Dwellings Company), £20; surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured, £4,040, making a total of £4,303 17s. 7d., and after deducting preferential claims leaves a balance of £4,115 5s. 7d. The debtor, not making any proposal, was adjudicated a bankrupt, and Mr. F. A. Boulton, of 39, King William Street, was appointed trustee at such remuneration as may be determined upon at a subsequent meeting. The debtor, it appears, commenced business about six years ago, having retired from the partnership of Haycock and Steer, of Forest Gate, with a capital of about £300. He was formerly in partnership with Mr. John Haycock. The partnership was dissolved about six years ago, he leaving the business with a capital of about £300. The debtor has kept books but has not balanced them. The liabilities are stated to have been incurred in the business about which he is still in possession. Several meetings of his creditors have been held on two occasions, and he seems to have had sufficient for the Official Receiver's opinion. Several meetings against creditors had commenced on the 17th and 24th of April last respectively. At the meeting of his creditors held on the 1st inst. the debtor was adjudicated a bankrupt, and Mr. F. A. Boulton, of 39, King William Street, was appointed trustee at such remuneration as may be determined upon at a subsequent meeting.\nThe following is a list of the creditors showing unsecured claims £21. Assets appeared as creditors fully secured £21.\nCREDITORS.\nChapman —, London\nDyer —, Walthamstow\nDay —, Ferry Boat House, Tottenham\nEverett —, Walthamstow\nFrancis —, 9, Austin Friars\nGoulding —, Lea Bridge Road\nJones —, Lamb street, Spitalfields\nLott —, Walthamstow\nMills —, Curtain Road\nPalmer G., Leytonstone\nParker —, Shandy Street, Mile End\nReader —, Bethnal Green\nSkelton —, High Street, Homerton\nWebster —, Waltham Abbey\nCREDITORS FULLY SECURED.\nBristol Land Society\nBuilding Societies (anonymous)\nCoborn —, Coborn, Road, Bow\nFrancis —, 9, Austin Friars\nPARTLY SECURED.\nDyer W. B., Walthamstow\nThe trustee (Mr. C. J. Singleton) stated that from the investigation he had made he had every reason to believe that the debtor had not disclosed all his estate, but had concealed a portion of it. The public examination was fixed for the 1st July, and he should oppose any application for an adjournment. Mr. Registrar Brougham said he should not grant an adjournment, and he fixed the 1st. July for the public examination. The debtor supported the application for an adjournment.\nHENRY HOPCROFT, victualler, the Angel Inn, Stourport.\nThe following is a list of the creditors :—\nBishop & Sons, London\nEckstein & Co., Birmingham\nGoodman Charles, Astley, Worcester\nGarrick Thomas, Stourport\nJones Eliza, Stourport\nLeonard & Harrington, Worcester\nMitton T. & Co., Stourport\nShepherd & Broom, Kidderminster\nStringer James, Stourport\nSoutherton Thomas, Stourport\nThompson & Sons, Dudley\nWickham & Norris, Bristol\nYoung & Co., Liverpool",
