J. & W. G., cabinet-makers, Hanover Buildings, and St. Mary Road, Southampton.—The sitting for the public examination of this debtor was held at the Southampton Bankruptcy Court, last week, before Mr. Registrar Daw. Mr. W. L. Bell appeared for the trustee (Mr. A. Bennett), Mr. W. A. Killby for bankrupt, and Mr. J. C. Moberley (Official Receiver) for the Board of Trade. The Registrar examined the senior debtor with reference to the circumstances under which the stock in St. Mary Road was sold, and on Mr. Bell's application, the accounts ordered at the last sitting being only filed that morning, a further adjournment was ordered for a fortnight. A more complete account of the transactions with Mr. Furber and a cash account were also ordered to be furnished in the meantime, the bankrupts being told that unless they gave more satisfactory replies the examination would be adjourned sine die.\nBOWIE, FRANCIS, builder, Lower Clapton, E.—The receiving order in this case was made in September last, and the bankrupt applied on Wednesday for his order of discharge. The liabilities were £1,582 8s. 7d., and it appeared that the assets had realised £20. The bankrupt, who had carried on business for about seven years, having started with £350 capital, attributed his failure to his inability to finish certain houses on which he was engaged. His books of account were imperfectly kept. Mr. Registrar Giffard suspended the order of discharge for three weeks.\nBUXTON, W.

Debts, £1,796; assets, £348. In reply to the Official Solicitor the bankrupt said he had traded as a builder and contractor since June, 1884. He had previously failed in 1879, and paid 20s. in the pound. By the stoppage of the West of England Bank in June, 1884, he had a capital of £1,000, and paid £725 for a building agreement, by which he lost over £1,000. He kept no books. The debt of £290 to Mr. Lewis was quite correct; it was for the purchase of the Empire Steam Joinery Works in December, 1886. He could not meet the bills which he gave for the purchase money. The bankrupt passed his examination.\nCOLEMAN, GEORGE, joiner, Walcote, Leicestershire.—The following creditors are interested in this failure :—\n£ s. d.\nNixon William, Ullesthorpe ... ... ... 125 10 0\nBuck & Son, Lutterworth... ... ... 30 10 0\nColeman H., Rugby... ... ... ... 20 10 0\nMatterson, Huxley, & Watson, Coventry ... 13 7 0\nHill Henry, Leamington ... ... ... 10 10 0\nCooper & Sturges, Leicester ... ... 18 9 0\nTurner Thomas, Lutterworth ... ... 10 10 0\nMillar & Co., Rugby ... ... ... ... 29 10 0\nDriver James, Lutterworth ... ... ... 10 0 0\nSavage J.
