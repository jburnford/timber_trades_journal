THE AUSTRALIAN TIMBER TRADE.
MESSRS. LORD & HUGHES, of Melbourne, state in their circular of the 22nd August that the amount of business done in the market for timber and building materials during the past month has been fairly good, and prices for Oregon deals and Norwegian flooring show a considerable advance on July sales, whilst Baltic deals have fully maintained last month's rates. Deliveries from storage yards have been active, and dealers report a good demand for consumption. As the spring weather has now fairly set in, we look for an improved trade demand during the next few months.
Messrs. GEMMELL, TUCKETT, & Co.'s monthly timber report, dated August 24th, says:— Business carried through during the month has been well up to the average, notwithstanding that this is the dull period of the year, when a falling off in the consumption is usually expected. Deliveries from the store yards have been steady, and from present appearances the existing activity in the building trades is likely to continue, and there is every prospect of an active demand in the spring. Norwegian and Scotch flooring.—Imports, 2,507,813 ft. lin. The bulk of this line offered at auction during the month consisted of parcels of Scotch manufacture, RMS brand, ex Loch Broome, Loch Vennachar, and Loch Garry, which realized an advance on last month's rates. We also report sales ex Noatun, Wiese & Co.; parcels ex Katoomba and Burrumbeet, transhipped from Sydney, AHK & Co., and C & Co., and various brands ex Concordia, Tambarskelver, &c., which have been some time in store, and quote for red, 6x1 1/2, t. and g., 11s. to 10s. 9d.; 4x1 1/2, 7s. 3d.; 6x 3/4, 10s. 6d.; 6x 5/8, 6s. 6d.; 6x 1/2, beaded, 6s. 3d.; 4x 1/2 do., 3s. 10d.; 6x 3/4 do., 6s. 9d.; 6x 5/8 do., 5s.; 4-out weatherboards, 6s. 3d.; white, 6x1 1/2, 9s. 9d.; 6x 3/4, 10s. 3d. to 9s. 9d.; 6x 5/8, 6s. 9d. to 6s. 3d.; 6x 1/2, beaded, 6s. 3d.; 6x 3/4 do., 6s. 3d.; 6x 5/8 do., 5s. to 4s. 11d.; 4-out weatherboards, 6s. 3d. to 5s. 9d.; 9x1 red torus skirting, 18s.; 7x 7/8 white do., 10s. per 100 ft. lin. Baltic red deals.—We report sales ex Forfarshire, A+S, 16 to 13 ft. 9x3, 4 1/2d. to 4 1/4d. Ex Noatun 9x3, Wiese & Co., white, 3-cut, 3 1/4d.; 7-cut, 4 1/4d. The cargo ex Jotun was offered at auction on the 18th inst., when 15,776 out of 19,375 pieces were sold. 3rds realized a slight advance on last quotations, but 4ths were a shade lower, viz., WSW, 9x4, 5 1/2d. to 5d.; 11x3, 5 1/4d. to 5 1/8d.; 9x3, 5d.; 8x3, 4 3/4d. to 4 1/2d.; 7x3, 4 3/4d.; 7x2 1/2, 4 1/2d. to 4d.; WTW, 11x3, 4 3/4d.; 9x3, 4 1/2d.; 7x3, 4 1/4d.; 7x2 1/2, 4 1/4d. to 4d. per ft.; 9x3 12 ft. and up. Stocks in store are still very heavy, having been reduced very slowly during the past few months; in fact, all lower qualities than the best Baltic 3rds are now superseded by Oregon timber. Spruce deals.—Ex Llewellyn J. Morse, a small parcel was quitted at auction for 11x3 4 1/4d.; 9x3, 3 1/2d. per ft. 9x3. Pitch pine.—No sales. Californian redwood.—No sales. Stocks here are ample for present requirements, but the next parcels offered will realize an advance on late quotations. Doors.—The following rates have been obtained at auction during the month:—For 2·6x6·6 1 1/4 D.M., red deal (colonial), 11s. 6d.; American 2·8x6·8 1 1/2 D.M., clear pine, 17s. 6d., duty paid; 2·6x6·6 1 1/4 D.M., 15s. to 14s. do.; American 2·10x6·10 1 3/4 D.M., No. 1 quality, 18s., in bond; do. No. 2, 16s. 6d.; do. No. 3, 15s. 6d. (duty, 5s. each). Mahogany.—No sales. Laths.—Considerable sales have been made this month at an advance on previous rates. Spruce laths, 4 1/2 ft., 31s.; Baltic do., 4 1/2 ft. 28s. 6d. to 24s.; do. 4 ft., 21s. The arrivals include—From Glasgow: Loch Vennachar, 966,880 ft. Scotch flooring; Loch Garry, 626,492 ft. Scotch flooring. From Fredrikstad: Noatun, 407,239 ft. flooring, 781 deals, 1837 bundles laths.

COMPRESSED WOOD.—In reference to the wood-compressing machine of Mr. Pickles, Burnley, Lancashire, recently noticed in our columns, we are asked to state by the inventor that he will be glad to subject to experiments any woods our readers may send him for this purpose.
