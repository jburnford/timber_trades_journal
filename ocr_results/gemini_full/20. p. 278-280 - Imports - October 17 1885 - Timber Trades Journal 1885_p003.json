WATSON, builder, 1, Parade, Lordship Lane, Dulwich.—This debtor filed his own petition on the 29th August, and his accounts show fully secured debts of £3,031, partly secured £678 14s. 4d. (the value of the securities being £420), and unsecured £1,701 15s. 3d., against assets of £581 4s. 2d. The first meeting of creditors was held on Monday week, before Mr. Wildy, one of the assistant Official Receivers.

A., Bermondsey ... ... ... 178 14 4 (Estimated value of security £20)\nMr. A. G. Ditton appeared for the debtor, while Mr. Street appeared for creditors. Mr. Ditton, on the debtor's behalf, offered a cash composition of 5s. in the pound on condition that the three execution creditors now in possession agreed to come in with the other creditors. After some short discussion, the meeting accepted the composition, the Official Receiver being appointed to distribute it at a commission of 5 per cent.\nB. TILLETT, builder, Leytonstone.—This case (reported last week) was again before the Court on Tuesday. Mr. Registrar Pepys had refused to confirm the scheme agreed to by the creditors, mainly upon the ground that the debtor had neglected to keep proper books ; and Mr. Woolf, on the debtor's behalf, now asked his Honour to reconsider his decision. The Registrar said that the case now assumed a different aspect from that in which it was presented to him last week. It now appeared that, although the debtor did not keep proper books, he had an acceptance book, and kept a banking account, and that with the aid of these materials he would have had little trouble in ascertaining how he stood. The application was also concurred in by creditors for £3,800 out of a total of about £4,000, and he should therefore reverse his previous decision and order the scheme to be approved.\nW.
