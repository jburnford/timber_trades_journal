[MAY 16, 1885.]
A TIMBER - LADEN KEEL capsized in the River Humber, on Wednesday morning. The captain was swept away and drowned, and his wife and three children, who were sleeping on board, were also drowned. The mate was saved by getting into the boat, from which he was picked up by the smack Samples. A later telegram from Hull states that the steam tug Hecla was towing down from Keadby on Wednesday morning, when the captain of the Whitton lightship asked the tug to stop, and assist with the keel, which was floating bottom upward, as he thought some one was alive on board. The keel was broken into, and the captain's wife and child rescued by a man named Rushworth, who entered the hull. Mrs. Snowden had occupied her floating prison for 17 hours. Her husband and two other children were found dead, entangled in the rigging.

DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN TIMBER YARDS.
Saturday last will henceforth be considered a red letter day in the annals of the London Fire Brigade. On that day there were no less than five fires in different parts of London, two of which assumed gigantic and most alarming proportions. One of the latter took place at Memel Wharf, Canal Bank, Albany Road, Camberwell, almost adjoining the Walworth Road. The spot where it first broke out was in the centre of a huge stack of firewood, covering an area of 90 ft. by 80 ft., and piled to a height of 45 ft. The front of the stack, which is the property of Messrs. Groom & Son, overlooked the Albany Road, while the back abutted on a small dock from the Surrey Canal. Alongside the stack stood stabling, and then some dwelling-houses, while towards the Walworth Road the houses were separated from it by a narrow roadway. It was at once seen that the stack was well alight, and in less than an hour there were no fewer than twenty-nine steamers, two hydrants, and one standpipe in full work. As in all fires of this description, there was no getting at the heart of it with the water, and the heavy work of unbuilding had to be gone on with. This was a task of great magnitude, and was rendered more difficult by the blinding smoke.
About seven o'clock a number of the men were at work on the canal side, when suddenly the whole face of the stack fell out, burying one of the firemen from Brixton station, named Joseph Clark, who was afterwards extricated, and conveyed to Guy's Hospital. Almost directly after this, there was another fall on the side, which partly demolished the stables, from which the horses had been already removed. About eight o'clock the American extension ladder was brought up, and with the aid of it the work of hauling down was commenced from the roadway. From the ladder, to which they were attached by stout ropes, so that in the event of a fall they would remain suspended in mid-air, about a dozen firemen got to work throwing down the timbers, and giving openings for the water from the adjoining rooftops to be poured down into the burning mass in the heart of the stack. Though the process is slow it is sure, and all fears of any spread beyond the timber yard were soon at an end. All the steamers were arranged along the banks of the canal, from which they pumped the water directly, while the fuel was supplied from a coal wharf adjoining. Beyond the burning out of the timber yard, the dwelling houses next the stables were damaged by fire through them, or having the hose conveyed through other houses were in-convenienced to burn during the afternoon. The stack and stock were insured in the Guardian and Magdeburg offices.
