MYERS' BOX AND BARREL CO.
The statutory meeting of Myers' Patent Box and Barrel Machine Company, Limited, was held on Friday week at the Cannon Street Hotel, Mr. John Crosfield, J.P., presiding.
Mr. William Kennedy (the secretary) having read the notice calling the meeting,
The Chairman said: Ladies and gentlemen, we directors are very pleased to meet you here to-day, but you understand that this is merely the statutory meeting which has to be held within a certain time by Act of Parliament.
The works at Bow are being altered to suit the important manufacture that is going to take place, and I may tell you that since the date of these works we have been at full work, and that we have more orders than we can execute, so that the prospects of the company are eminently satisfactory. (Cheers.) The machinery, when it is fixed, will be capable of making from 12,000 to 15,000 boxes a day, and 2,000 barrels a day. All of your directors are interested in the case and barrel trade, either directly or indirectly. At every meeting we have held since the company was formed we have had applications for from 1,000 to 1,500 shares, and to-day the number of shares taken is 95,000. (Hear, hear.) I may mention that if any shareholders would like to go and see the works there will be either one or two of the directors there to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock. You should know, however, that the works are not completed. The new building it was decided to have erected is being slated at the present time and Mr. Myers, our managing director, informs me that in the course of a very short space of time he will have the place going at full work. (Hear, hear.) I need hardly tell you shareholders that the great advantage of this company is that we have Mr. Myers himself as our managing director. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Myers is the inventor of nearly all the machinery that is employed at these works, and as regards its character I can speak from my own experience as a manufacturer, because we have got Myers' box-making machines, his printing machines, his planing machines, and his saw bench, at our works at Warrington, and we are making 10,000 boxes a week. Thus I can speak with great confidence, from my own experience, of the value of this machinery, and I say to you shareholders that I believe you have in this company what will prove to be one of the most prosperous concerns in the kingdom. (Cheers.) I may also tell you that we have a lease of land at Bow, that we pay only £200 a year, and the lease has 34 years to run, and the value of that lease to-day is four or five times more than what we paid for it. (Cheers.) This is a great and important item in the concern, because it means a considerable saving in your working expenses when you have a cheap lease. The situation of the works
