PRACTICAL
[OUR Readers are invited to make free use of this column both to ask and to answer matters connected with saw-milling, wood machinery and materials, and to give any information by replying to the questions. Questions are given one week to be replied to them in the following issue.]
QUESTIONS.
Heating Buildings.—Can any reader say how many cubic feet of boiler power is required to heat a building containing 100,000 cubic feet of space ?—X. Y. Z.
Watertight Cement for Cisterns.—Will you oblige me with a recipe for above ?—B. P.
Proportion of Boiler Chimney.—Will you oblige me with any information on the above, and is there a reliable rule to go by on the subject? I want the correct size for a chimney suitable for a 30 horse-power boiler, working at 60 lbs. of steam, using steam coal, and occasionally sawdust.—"MATCHED LINING."
Shaping Hexagonal Church Spire Legs.—Can you inform me what is the best way to do the above, or give me name and maker of such a machine and the cutters?—C. M. R. (Manchester).
Housing Stair Treads.—What is the best way to do the above, and the best machine or apparatus for the purpose?—J. T.
Grease in Feed-water of Boiler.—I am constantly finding a considerable quantity of grease and dirt in the feed-water of my boiler, and am not able to account for it. Is its presence in the boiler injurious or otherwise, and what is the best way to get rid of it?—SUBSCRIBER.
ANSWERS.
Tapping Birch Trees.—In reply to "P. G." tapping birch trees is practised in Norway and Sweden ; it is done in March by inserting a tap or spout into the trunk of the tree some two feet from the ground. We believe the sap is used to mix with wine, such as sherry, and is said to be very palatable, but we have never tasted any. We should recommend you to put yourself under a practical forester for a few months, and buy some good books on the subject of forestry and arboriculture.
Tapping Birch Trees.—In Kamschatka the sap of the birch is made into a beverage and vinegar: a sugar is extracted and a spirit distilled from it ; 240 bottles of sap give one of syrup, which is used in Russia in the same way as sugar without being crystallised. During the siege of Hamburg by the Russians in 1814 almost all the birch trees in the neighbourhood were destroyed by the Boshkirs and other barbarian soldiers in the Russian army by being tapped for their sap. The wine is produced by fermenting the sap with sugar, hot water, and hops in the usual manner. The sugar is produced by boiling and evaporating, and the wine is made as follows:—The sap is first obtained by boring a hole 1 in. or 1½ in. deep in each tree, near the ground, and on the south side of the trunk. In England several holes are sometimes bored in the same tree at once, but in France this method is thought to deprive the tree of its sap too suddenly. The hole should have a kind of fosset fixed in it, which may be made of a piece of elder with the pith scooped out, or of a large quill. The outer end of the tube is placed in a bottle or large bladder to preserve the sap. In some places the collectors of the sap cut off the extremities of the branches, tying a bladder or vessel to the end of the wounded branch. When a sufficient quantity of sap has been collected, the hole in the tree is stopped with a wooden peg, or the end of the wounded branch is covered with pitch. This operation is always performed in spring, and most sap is said to be produced after a severe winter. Several holes should be bored at the same time, in order that a sufficient quantity of sap may be obtained in one day, as it is spoiled by being kept. It has been observed that the sap flows in greatest abundance about noon. When the wine is to be made, the sap should be boiled with moist sugar or honey, in the proportion of four pounds of sugar to every gallon of liquor. While boiling the scum is taken off as fast as it rises, till the liquor is quite clear. It is then worked off in the usual way. The juice and rind (pared very thin) of a lemon, and one Seville orange, may be added to every gallon.
A DERBYSHIRE TIMBER MERCHANT.
At the Derbyshire Assizes, held at Cromford, Derbyshire, on Monday last, a certain timber merchant, who formerly resided at Holloway, near Cromford, pleaded guilty to forging the acceptance of a certain bill of exchange for the payment of £22 10s. with intent to defraud the Derby and Derbyshire Banking Company, Limited, at Matlock, on the 10th November, 1886. Mr. Weightman, Q.C., addressed his Lordship in mitigation of the sentence, pointing out that the prisoner was a respectable tradesman who had got into difficulties through the depreciation of the value of his property, and that he had been tempted to do this wrong act to tide over a certain period, when he expected to be able to meet all liabilities. Evidence as to his good character was called. His Lordship, taking into consideration the prisoner's good character, and other matters, passed sentence of six months' imprisonment with hard labour.
