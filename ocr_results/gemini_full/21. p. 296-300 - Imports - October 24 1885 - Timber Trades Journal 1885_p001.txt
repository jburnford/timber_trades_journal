shipping ports including besides Archangel, several in the White Sea, and several of the Norwegian ports, such as Christiania, Porsgrund, and Drontheim.
The busy state of the docks is scarcely reflected in the state of the trade, so far as selling is concerned, there being comparatively little doing, and most of the wood now arriving will have to go into stock, the only extensive outlet in prospect being the International Exhibition Buildings to be erected in Edinburgh. It is now announced that the Building Committee have accepted the tender of Messrs. Arrol Bros., for the steelwork of the permanent building ; Messrs. Robert Shillinglaw & Son, for the mason, brick, and timber work of the permanent building ; and Messrs. William Beattie & Sons for the whole of the temporary buildings. This last will require a very large quantity of wood, but the stocks held here are considered quite ample for all requirements.
There was a public sale held on Tuesday, by Messrs. Ferguson, Davidson, & Co., at the Imperial Saw-mills, but the attendance of buyers was not large, and the quantity disposed of inconsiderable. The cut yellow pine formed the chief item, and the prices obtained for what was sold averaged 2d. per sup. ft. for in. average. Of deals and battens there were not many sold, with the exception of 6½x2½ whitewood at 1½d. per lin. ft. Owing to the small attendance and lack of competition the sale finished early.

WATER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CARDIFF AND THE MIDLANDS.
A scheme for an improved water communication between Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury, and the Bristol Channel ports, which was before Mr. Salt’s committee in the session of 1883, is now being again brought before the leading merchants of Cardiff, Newport, and Swansea. Among a long list of supporters of the scheme, which embrace the great importers and exporters at Cardiff, are the names of Messrs. Spiller & Co., Messrs. Alexander & Co., Messrs. Bland & Co., Messrs. Watson & Son, Messrs. Elliott & Son, &c., and one firm has offered to guarantee freights amounting to £20,000 annually. From Cardiff to Worcester, via Berkeley Canal and the River Severn, there is an uninterrupted water communication for vessels of 200 tons. The canal from Worcester to Birmingham has been the stumbling -block in the way of opening to Birmingham and South Staffordshire a good water communication with the towns on the seaboard in the Bristol Channel, and with Ireland and France. Plans have been prepared by Mr. George William Keeling, C.E., Victoria Street, Westminster, for the widening, deepening, and improving of this canal, so as to enable steam vessels of 200 tons or lighters of 250 tons to take in or discharge a cargo at Birmingham. The cost of this undertaking is estimated by him at £600,000, and for the purpose of furthering the scheme Mr. Keeling and a few of the promoters had an interview a few days since with the Mayor of Birmingham, while a few of the merchants at Cardiff, Newport, and Swansea, who have taken the matter up warmly, are obtaining the signatures of other merchants and shippers promising support. The great advantage to the merchants and shippers of Cardiff and Newport is the effectual competition such a water scheme would offer to the present railway rates. The present rate for grain and timber from Cardiff to Birmingham or vice versa is 9s. 8d. per ton. By the proposed route the cost will be 5s. 6d. per ton, while the delay in transit as compared with the railway rate is only twelve hours. Iron ore imported at Cardiff is sent to the South Staffordshire furnaces at 6s. 2d. per ton, but by the proposed route the rate would be very low. At the present time a large proportion of the Spanish ore imported here is sent on to South Staffordshire. It is stated that the trade at the Bristol Channel ports amounts to one-fifth of the total shipping trade for England and Wales. The geographical position of the Bristol Channel offers great shipping facilities to and from foreign ports, and Cardiff is the port best situated as a depot for the great trade flowing between the Midland district and New York, and a trade, which now mainly flows to Bristol, would be directed to Cardiff, and should the Atlantic Dock be constructed, the water communication between Birmingham and Cardiff via the Berkeley and the Worcester Canals would act as a great auxiliary to it. One of the largest manufacturing firms at Birmingham has recently leased land from Lord Tredegar, on the bank of the Usk, near Tydu, for the purpose of erecting works that will give employment to a large number of hands, and enable them to save the railway rates on the raw material sent to them, and the railway rates of the manufactured goods to the port of shipment.

A FRAME SAW is shown in a painting at Herculaneum. The sawyers are at each end, one standing and the other sitting. The bench to which the timber is clamped is supported by four-legged stools. The saw frame is square and the saw blade is strained in the middle. The teeth stand perpendicular to the plan of the frame.
