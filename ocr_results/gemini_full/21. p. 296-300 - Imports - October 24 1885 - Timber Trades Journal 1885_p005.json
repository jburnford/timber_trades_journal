The statement of affairs filed shows total liabilities £187 16s. 4½d., and assets £107 12s. 7½d., with a deficiency of £80 3s. 9d. The causes of failure alleged by the debtor are want of capital, bad trade, bad debts, pressure of creditors, and sickness of self. The Official Receiver made the following observations :— The debtor states he commenced business in 1880, without any capital. A seizure by the sheriff under an execution for £38 necessitated the filing of his petition. As the debtor consented to an immediate adjudication, I deemed it in the interests of the creditors to direct an immediate realization of the estate. The matter was left to the Official Receiver to realize. The following are the creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nGadstone C. & B., ironmongers, 11, Brushfield Street, London ... ... ... ...\nHopton T. W., timber merchant, 136, Broadwall, Stamford Street, London, S.E. ... 44 3 1\nLloyd & Co., oil and colour merchants, 3, James' Hall Buildings, Upper Thames Street, London ... ... ... ... 31 14 3\nParker F., Bonhay Foundry, Exeter ... ... 14 12 4\nReynolds & Son, merchants, Tucker Street, Bath Street, Bristol ... ... ... ... 23 16 0\nWay & Algar, merchants, Palace Gates, Exeter ... ... ... ... ... 13 17 4\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... 18 10 5\nG. C. LAY.—The public examination of this bankrupt, whose failure has been previously reported, was held at the Winchester Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, before Judge Leonard. Mr. W. Shenton, Deputy Official Receiver, conducted the examination. The bankrupt was subjected to a long and searching examination relative to some goods which it was alleged had been sold by auction, and also to his large deficiency, of which no account had been given, and eventually it was decided to adjourn the case for a month, the bankrupt in the meantime to furnish to the Official Receiver a detailed account, showing how his deficiency was caused.\nBERRY & TAYLOR.—The debtors, Philip Berry and Alfred Taylor, traded as builders and contractors, Danbrook Road, Lower Streatham, and Gladstone Road, North Croydon. The receiving order was made against these debtors on the 25th September last, and the first meeting of creditors was held on the 14th inst. at the office of the Official Receiver, Mr. Cecil Mercer, 109, Victoria Street, Westminster. The statement of affairs filed shows debts due to unsecured creditors £556 18s., and to creditors fully secured £4,008 10s., the value of the securities being estimated at £4,100, thus showing a surplus of £91 10s., and this surplus and stock-in-trade, estimated to realize £10, constitute their only assets. The statement, therefore, shows a deficiency of £455 8s. The debtors commenced business in partnership about, June 1884, Berry with a capital of £200, and Taylor with a capital of £100. The business of the partnership only continued for about twelve months, and ended in June last, and they have since then been endeavouring to compromise with their creditors. They have omitted to keep proper books of account, and in consequence their financial position is not shown. The securities held by creditors fully secured consist of mortgages on freehold property at Old Town, Croydon, and Zingley and Bancroft Villas, and the amount at which the property has been valued only shows a surplus of £91 10s., although it cost considerably more, and the difference in its present value is accounted for by the serious depreciation in property and the general depression in the building trade, and the debtors account for their deficiency in this way. The debtors state that every endeavour has been made to realize the property, and that it has been put up to auction but no bid was made. An offer to make any offer for the bankrupts, the Official Receiver being appointed trustee, with the principal creditors as a committee.\nBradford J., 22, Little Heath, Charlton\nBrickfields Co., Little Heath, Charlton\nChadwick H.

MARKOFF v. BURT, BOULTON, & HAYWOOD.—At the Southampton County Court on Tuesday, Mr. F. Markoff, captain of the barque Amanda, of Southampton, sued Messrs. Burt, Boulton, & Haywood, timber merchants, Southampton, to recover the sum of £29 10s. balance of freight due in respect of the conveyance of a cargo of deals and battens from the Baltic to Fletcher's Wharf at Ealing. Mr. W. Coxwell, solicitor, represented the plaintiff, Mr. Sims-Williams, barrister-at-law, instructed by Messrs. Lamport & Trunnell, for the defendants. Captain R. W. Evans, assisted the judge as nautical assessor. The defendants counterclaimed £29 10s. for damage done to the timber. It appeared that owing to there not being enough water to allow the vessel to get to Ealing, the captain lightened the deckload into lighters, and they were taken to Fletcher's Wharf at Ealing. Notice was given to the defendants' agents on the 16th July. The barge remained in the position it had taken up the whole of the night and the whole of the next day, the consequence being that at the evening tide the lighter, which was flat-bottomed, \"sucked the mud,\" as it was called, and would not rise. The cargo was flooded with water, and the contention of the defendants was that it was damaged to the extent of £29 10s. For the plaintiff it was alleged that, if any damage was caused, it was no neglect of the plaintiff. Evidence was given in support of the defendants' case, to the effect that the timber had been considerably damaged and suffered in value. It was also urged that the timber was never delivered. Rebutting evidence having been called, his Honour gave judgment for plaintiff, both on the claim and the counterclaim, with costs.\n\nTHOMAS [?]\nTIMBER PR[?]\nENGLISH & FOREIGN [?]\nWITHAM SAW-MILLS, W[?]\nImporter of Permanent and Temporary Sleepers.\nSilver Medal Awarded Scientific Exhibition, London.\nTHOMAS HO[?]\nSaw Mill Engineers, Molesey, London, S.W.\nSAWING AND WOOD-WORKING MACHINERY.\nMAKERS OF\nSTEAM\nEngines\nBOILERS,\nSHAFTING, &c.\nSuitable for Saw Mills, Timber Yards, Contractors, Wagon Builders, Ship-builders, Railway Companies, Joiners, Builders, Cabinet-makers, Wheelwrights, &c.\nSaw Bench, improved Patent.
