ARTHUR BOUTT.—In the Brighton County Court, on the 6th inst., before Mr. Registrar Jones, an order was made against the estate of Arthur Boutt, of 1, Havelock-road, Preston, builder and contractor, for summary administration. The debtor shows unsecured debts £2,024 1s. 6d.; creditors fully secured, £1,850; creditors partly secured, £1,850; less estimated value of securities, £1,850; leaving £300 to rank for dividend. The total liabilities, £2,324 7s.; total, £2,324 1s. 6d. The assets consist of stock-in-trade, at cost £650, estimated to produce £250; book debts £500, estimated to produce £200; furniture (all good), £62 7s. 11d.; surplus from securities in the hands of creditors, estimated at £40; total, £552 7s. 11d.

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
£50; total, £342 7s. 11d. Deduct amount due to preferential creditors for rent, rates, and taxes, £21 8s. 3d., leaving net assets, £320 19s. 8d. with a deficiency of £1,680 1s. 6d., which is accounted for by losses on building, deterioration in value of property mortgaged, loss on plant, and forced sale of stock, and £320 by reason of a contract with Messrs. Butt & Co. It appears the debtor commenced business in September, 1881, with a capital of £50, and had resided at Frederick Place and Havelock Road, Brighton. Messrs. Newington and Nicholson had obtained judgments against the debtor, which caused him to suspend payment on the 2nd May, and he was not aware till then that he was insolvent. He prepared a statement of his affairs at the end of last year, and also took stock, for his own information, and from that he appeared to be solvent. His annual income he estimated at £200, and his household and personal expenditure about £150. At the meeting of creditors a composition will be offered.

The Official Receiver made the following observations:—The debtor states that since 1860 he carried on business at Kensington as a builder and decorator, at which time he estimates that he had a capital or surplus of £800, he purchased a lease of certain plots of ground at Harlesden, and commenced building. In August, 1884, he sold the stock and goodwill of his business at Kensington for £300, subject to certain deductions and the amount realized from the collection of his outstanding book debts chiefly on the proceeds. The debtor attributes his failure and deficiency to loss by over payments, &c., for the buildings at Harlesden, and by depreciation in the value of the property; to loss by the forced sale of his plant and material; to law and other expenses in connection with the foreclosure of a mortgage, and to the stoppage of his credit, which prevented his proceeding with his building. His books have been imperfectly kept. Mr. Bolton and Mr. S. Ward appeared for the creditors and debtor, and he signed a consent to an adjudication. No offer was made, and an order for summary administration had been made, and the Official Receiver will wind up the estate. The public examination stands for June 3rd.
MOSES STILLWELL, timber merchant, The Plain, Wandsworth.—The receiving order was made against this debtor on 30th April last, and the first meeting of creditors was held on the 19th inst. at the offices of the Official Receiver, 109, Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W., Mr. H. Shirtcliffe in the chair. The statement of affairs shows liabilities to unsecured creditors, £786 16s. 4d.; to creditors partly secured, £230; less estimated value of securities, £100; which leaves £130 to rank, and makes total liabilities £916 16s. 4d., and assets as follows:—Stock-in-trade, £5; book debts, £361 17s. 11d.; cash, 10s. 10d., and furniture, £10; making a total of £377 8s. 9d., from which has to be deducted £1 5s. for preferential claims, thus leaving net assets at £376 3s. 9d., and showing a deficiency of £540 12s. 7d. The debtor states that he became aware of his insolvency in or about February last, and that he called a private meeting of his creditors at the offices of the London Timber Trades Association. No statement was then presented thereat, but he made an offer of 10s. in the pound, payable by instalments. He commenced business in 1877 with a capital of £400 to £500, and attributes his failure to bad debts and bad trade, and can account for his deficiency in no other way. The security held by the creditor partly secured consists of the deposit of the lease of the debtor's premises for a loan of £230. After some discussion it was resolved that the debtor be adjudicated bankrupt, and Mr. Ernest Foreman, of 57, Gracechurch Street, was appointed trustee to act with a committee of inspection. The following is a list of the principal creditors:—
