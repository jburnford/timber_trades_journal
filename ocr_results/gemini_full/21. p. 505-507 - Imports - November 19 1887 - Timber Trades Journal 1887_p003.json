Bryant, Powis, & Bryant, for the purpose of getting credit, that you had £1,400 worth of stock-in-trade besides book debts?\nThe bankrupt: Nothing of the kind.\nMr. Clayton: Did you represent anything as to the value of the stock?\nThe bankrupt: I cannot say.\nMr. Clayton: Did not you say that your stock-in-trade was sufficient of itself to pay your debts in full?\nThe bankrupt: I did not.\nMr. Clayton: Did they promise to give you credit in consequence of what you said?\nThe bankrupt: They promised, but did not.\nFurther examined, he said that after his previous failure he borrowed money, a portion of which he paid back.\nHe had been insolvent ever since his former failure.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence, Mr. Clayton asked, having regard to the deficiency appearing upon the accounts and the absence of proper books, that the bankrupt should be ordered to file a cash account.\nMr. Registrar Giffard then adjourned the case, and ordered the bankrupt to file the desired account on or before January 1st.\n\nBROWN, GOODMAN, builder, 2, Kingsland Green, N.—This case was noticed last week, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver.\nThe bankrupt, trading as Brown & Son, returned his unsecured debts at £893 19s., and assets consisting of book debts estimated to realise £181 10s.\nThe following were scheduled as creditors :-\n\n507\n\nAllshorn (trustee of), Dalston Lane ... ... £ s. d. 12 5 0\nAttle James, Ealing Green ... ... ... 60 0 0\nBaker R.

Davies (Davies, Codner, & Co.) being appointed trustee, and the Official Receiver acting as a committee of inspection.\n\nHOWE, CHARLES WILLIAM, chair manufacturer, 20, Devonshire Street, Bridgwater.—The statement of affairs filed herein shows gross liabilities £1,149 10s. 9d., viz.: unsecured creditors £515, fully secured creditors £547 10s. 11d., &c., expected to rank for dividend £515.\nThe assets are fittings, &c., £170, stock-in-trade, machinery in hand, 15s., other property £60, total £230 15s.\nThe deficiency is £284 5s.\nThe Official Receiver's observations are: The failure are bad trade and want of capital.\nThe accounts for his business show an excess of liabilities over assets on 31st October, 1886, £350, net loss from carrying on business since that date £60, household expenses of self, wife, and children £90, depreciation of stock, fixtures, fittings, &c., £50, total £550.\nThe following is a list of the principal creditors :-\nAlbert J., High Wycombe ... ... ... £ s. d. 15 13 9\nBland & Co., High Wycombe ... ... ... 10 2 6\n\nDRAPER, JOSEPH.—As briefly reported in the Timber Trades Journal last week a private meeting of the creditors of Mr. Joseph Draper, firewood merchant, was held at the Cannon Street Hotel on Friday, 11th November.\nThe statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £5,247 17s. 10d., against assets £5,898 7s. 10d.\nThe trade fixtures and fittings were estimated at £1,310, and the buildings at £2,170.\nThe lease of the premises had been deposited with Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. some twelve months prior, but it was understood the lease was regarded as of no value.\nMr. Ward (Thomson & Ward), in estimating the assets for the purpose of a composition, expressed an opinion that Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. had by virtue of the deposit of the lease an equitable mortgage not only on the premises, but also on the trade fixtures and fittings.\nThis was taken exception to by some of the creditors, who considered that, as there was no document in writing, Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. could not have any claim on the fixtures.\nUltimately a proposal was submitted to sell their debts for 7s. 6d. in the pound, payable by instalments.\nThe meeting was adjourned to give an opportunity of seeing whether those creditors who were not present would assent to the arrangement.\nWe learn that in the interest of the general body of creditors it was decided early in the week to place the matter in bankruptcy.\nAccordingly a petition has been filed and a receiving order obtained.\nAs the debtor lives at Battersea, the case comes under the jurisdiction of the Wandsworth County Court.\nThe following is a list of creditors over £20 :-\nGas Light & Coke Company ... ... ... £ s. d. 22 0 6\nHorn E.
