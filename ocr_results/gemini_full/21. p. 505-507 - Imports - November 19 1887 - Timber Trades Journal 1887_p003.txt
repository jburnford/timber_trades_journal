FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]

BROOM, GEORGE, mahogany and timber merchant and sawyer, Wilmer Gardens, Hoxton.—This was an adjourned sitting for public examination, before Mr. Registrar Giffard, on Friday week.
The receiving order was obtained on July 13th last, and the bankrupt's statement of affairs showed debts to the amount of £1,750, of which £1,704 were expected to rank, with assets £601.
He attributed his failure to losses by bad debts and the falling off in his business through depression, and inability, owing to his long illness, to attend to business.
The Official Receiver reported that the position of the bankrupt's affairs did not appear to have been ascertained at any time, but, having regard to his lack of capital and his losses by bad debts, he had evidently been insolvent for several years past.
Mr. Clayton appeared for the trustee, and Mr. Howell for the Official Receiver.
The bankrupt was extremely deaf, and the Registrar could not make him hear a word even with the aid of an instrument.
Counsel, however, succeeded better.
He stated, in reply to Mr. Clayton, that he estimated his stock at the value of £91, and his machinery at £159.
The Official Receiver had sold them, and they had only realised about £170.
He had kept a ledger and a kind of bill book.
Up to about two years ago his daughter kept them, but since she left him they had not been properly posted up.
He had been insolvent all his life.
The greater part of the debts had been contracted during the last two or three years.
When he contracted the debt of Longley & Sons of £477 in September, 1886, and July, 1887, he had no more expectation of being able to pay than he had now.
He had never been a bankrupt before, but on one occasion he became unable to pay his debts and filed a liquidation petition.
He remembered applying for his discharge, but whether he obtained it or not he did not know.
Mr. Howell stated that he believed the bankrupt was undischarged, but inquiries should be made on the subject.
The bankrupt said he believed his creditors were aware all along of his insolvent position.
Mr. Clayton: Did you represent to Messrs. Bryant, Powis, & Bryant, for the purpose of getting credit, that you had £1,400 worth of stock-in-trade besides book debts?
The bankrupt: Nothing of the kind.
Mr. Clayton: Did you represent anything as to the value of the stock?
The bankrupt: I cannot say.
Mr. Clayton: Did not you say that your stock-in-trade was sufficient of itself to pay your debts in full?
The bankrupt: I did not.
Mr. Clayton: Did they promise to give you credit in consequence of what you said?
The bankrupt: They promised, but did not.
Further examined, he said that after his previous failure he borrowed money, a portion of which he paid back.
He had been insolvent ever since his former failure.
At the conclusion of the evidence, Mr. Clayton asked, having regard to the deficiency appearing upon the accounts and the absence of proper books, that the bankrupt should be ordered to file a cash account.
Mr. Registrar Giffard then adjourned the case, and ordered the bankrupt to file the desired account on or before January 1st.

BROWN, GOODMAN, builder, 2, Kingsland Green, N.—This case was noticed last week, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver.
The bankrupt, trading as Brown & Son, returned his unsecured debts at £893 19s., and assets consisting of book debts estimated to realise £181 10s.
The following were scheduled as creditors :-

HOWE, CHARLES WILLIAM, chair manufacturer, 20, Devonshire Street, Bridgwater.—The statement of affairs filed herein shows gross liabilities £1,149 10s. 9d., viz.: unsecured creditors £515, fully secured creditors £547 10s. 11d., &c., expected to rank for dividend £515.

DRAPER, JOSEPH.—As briefly reported in the Timber Trades Journal last week a private meeting of the creditors of Mr. Joseph Draper, firewood merchant, was held at the Cannon Street Hotel on Friday, 11th November.
The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £5,247 17s. 10d., against assets £5,898 7s. 10d.
The trade fixtures and fittings were estimated at £1,310, and the buildings at £2,170.
The lease of the premises had been deposited with Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. some twelve months prior, but it was understood the lease was regarded as of no value.
Mr. Ward (Thomson & Ward), in estimating the assets for the purpose of a composition, expressed an opinion that Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. had by virtue of the deposit of the lease an equitable mortgage not only on the premises, but also on the trade fixtures and fittings.
This was taken exception to by some of the creditors, who considered that, as there was no document in writing, Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. could not have any claim on the fixtures.
Ultimately a proposal was submitted to sell their debts for 7s. 6d. in the pound, payable by instalments.
The meeting was adjourned to give an opportunity of seeing whether those creditors who were not present would assent to the arrangement.
We learn that in the interest of the general body of creditors it was decided early in the week to place the matter in bankruptcy.
Accordingly a petition has been filed and a receiving order obtained.
As the debtor lives at Battersea, the case comes under the jurisdiction of the Wandsworth County Court.
