THE GREENOCK HARBOUR TRUST IN DIFFICULTIES.
A circular was issued on Thursday week announcing what practically amounts to the suspension of the Greenock Harbour Trust.
This important crisis has been brought about by the abnormal depression of trade at the harbour of Greenock during the past winter.
The present debt of the trust is, roughly speaking, one million and a half, and the revenue last year was over £50,000—the lowest during ten years.
Procrastination is alleged to have taken place in grappling with the present difficulty, with the result that when the official figures were presented to the Trustees a few days ago they found themselves unable to tide over and meet their liabilities.
That such an important work as the Harbour Trust of a town like Greenock should thus, so to speak, be financially swamped at the approach of the first wave of adversity is not creditable, and much adverse criticism is being indulged in.
Meantime forbearance on the part of bondholders and creditors is advocated, and as the Trustees and the inhabitants are now fully alive to the seriousness of the financial position of the town and port, they are now likely to bestir themselves.
The following is the circular which has been issued by the Trust:—
“Greenock, 11th May, 1887.
“I am instructed by the Harbour Trustees to inform you that, in consequence of the difficulty of negotiating loans, owing to the present depression of trade, and the decrease of revenue arising from the same cause, the Trustees very much regret that the payment of principal and interest, due on the 15th inst., will be delayed.
The Trustees are, in the meantime, under the best advice, considering what is the wisest and best course to follow, and are in course of preparing a scheme of readjustment of the debt which, it is hoped, will prove satisfactory to all the bondholders of the trust.
As soon as the scheme has been completed the bondholders will be invited to meet together and consider the proposal of the Trustees.
“I am, your obedient servant,
“THOS. WILSON, Secretary.”

THE CONTRACT FOR THE MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL.
The Lancashire Evening Post of Monday last announced that provisional arrangements had been entered into between the directors of the Manchester Ship Canal and Mr. T. A. Walker, contractor, who is constructing the Preston Dock Works, for the construction of the canal.
The sum mentioned as the price of the contract is £5,000,000.
Mr. Walker has already in hand contracts to the amount of £18,000,000.

THE commencement of the Great North Sea and Baltic Canal has been fixed for June 6th, and it is expected that the ceremony will be attended by the Emperor of Germany, the Crown Prince, Prince Bismarck, and a crowd of German sovereigns.

CANADIAN LUMBER NOTES.—The log-cut in the Lake of the Woods region of Canada is estimated this year at 32,000,000 ft.
The Kewatin Lumber Company will get in 12,000,000 ft. of logs and 150,000 ties.
The operations of the others are as follows:—Dick & Banning, three camps, will cut 6,000,000 ft.
Cameron & Kennedy, three camps, probable cut, 2,000,000.
The Ontario & Minnesota Lumber Company have five camps working, and expect to tow 12,000,000 in the spring.
The Rainy Lake Lumber Company is surveying an extension to one of its timber limits on Rainy Lake.
The company is now in liquidation and not cutting this winter, but will have 9,000,000 ft. of old logs to saw this season.
In addition to this, great quantities of wood and ties have been taken out.
Ferguson & McDonald have taken out 150,000 ties and 5,000 cords of wood.
Cameron Bros., 5,000 cords of wood; Buchanan Bros., 125,000 ties; Chapman Bros., 70,000 lineal feet of piling; Buchanan & Sullivan, 50,000 cords of wood.
A despatch from Ottawa, of recent date, says:—The estimate of square timber made in the Nipissing and Ottawa districts during the past season is: White pine, 530,000 ft.; waney white pine, 355,000 ft.; red pine, 485,000 ft.; total, 1,370,000.
The export of Canadian lumber to Michigan is expected to be heavy this year.
From the Nipissing district it is computed that about 75,000 standards of logs will go to Michigan.
The district lumbermen unite in protesting against the increase made by the Quebec Government in the ground rents of timber lands.
They claim the new rents to be exorbitant.
It is said to be their intention to strip the timber from the areas in Quebec in as brief a space as possible, in order that they may then cease to pay the increase.
