Crundall, Mayor of Dover,\nwas examined last week before the House of\nLords committee on the subject of the Dover\nHarbour (corporation) Bill. He was under\nexamination for a considerable time, and\ngave the committee much valuable informa-\ntion. We understand that owing to an\ninformality in proceeding with the bill it\nhas been withdrawn. This, however, will not\nprevent the promoters taking action again\nnext session, which we learn is their intention.\n\nFOREIGN-OWNED SHIPS AND THE TIMBER-\nCARRYING TRADE.—In connection with the\ncircular issued from the Secretary of the Board\nof Trade regarding the application to foreign\nmerchant vessels of the Merchant Shipping\nAct, which appeared in the Glasgow Herald, the\nfollowing comparative statement, compiled by\nMr. L. G. Belleau, of H.M. Customs, Quebec,\nof the number and tonnage of sailing vessels\nand steamers cleared from Quebec in the years\n1882-86, will be interesting to those engaged\nin the timber-carrying trade:—\nBRITISH AND NORWEGIAN AND SWEDISH VESSELS\nCLEARED FROM QUEBEC IN THE YEARS 1882 TILL 1886.\nYear.

Bryant\n& May, Bow, had turned out on strike, owing\nto a dispute with their employers as to\nthe deductions from their earnings. The\ngirls are to be paid on the piecework system,\nand from every shilling they earn it is\ncustomary to deduct a penny or twopence,\naccording to circumstances. It appears that\nthe old foreman had left the works for some\nreason, and the earnings of the girls being\nsomewhat altered, and the mode of working\nbeing distasteful under the new system, the\nhands unanimously resolved to strike until\ntheir original locus standi had been re-\nestablished. If the strike continues very\ngreat distress will follow. So ran the report.\nA letter from the secretary of the company on\nWednesday, however, put a different com-\nplexion on the matter. It was to the\neffect that \"On Friday afternoon last, a\nforeman of one department resented some\nremonstrance from a manager, and resigned\nhis position, upon which about 100 female\noperatives, who had been under his control,\nleft work, stating as their reason that they\nwould not work under any other foreman. In\nconsequence of this partial strike, frivolous and\nridiculous in the extreme, operatives in other\ndepartments were necessarily thrown out until\nthis morning, when the disaffected ones\nreturned to work.\" Messrs. B. Bell & Co., of\nWandsworth, also write to say that, far from\nthe alleged strike being general in the match\ntrade, they are in perfect harmony with their\nworkpeople.\n\nPRACTICAL NOTES\n[Our Readers are invited to avail themselves\nof this column both to ask questions on all\nmatters connected with saw-mill and building\nmachinery and materials, and also to impart\ninformation by replying to the questions asked.\nQuestions are given one week and the answer\nto them in the following issue.]\n\nQUESTIONS.\nSilenetic Mortar.—Will you kindly inform\nme how the above is made, and is it considered\neffective ?—C.C.C.\n\nLubricating Cog Wheels.—What is the\nbest and most economical lubricant for the\nabove ?—S.W.M.\n\nInlaying Wood by Pressure.—Can you\ninform me how the new process of inlaying\nwood by pressure is performed, is it considered\neffective, and where can it be seen in opera-\ntion ?—VENEER.\n\nContinuous Feed Saw-Bench for\nColonial Use.—I hear there is a continuous\nfeed saw-bench especially adapted for Colonial\nuse, can you inform me as to how it works and\nthe name of the maker ?—COLONIAL.\n\nLow Water in Boiler.—What is the\nbest course to pursue in case of low water in\na boiler ?—TYRO.\n\nSidewear on Crank-Shaft Bearings\nof Deal Frame.—The bearings on the crank-\nshaft of my deal frame are constantly giving\ntrouble through excessive sidewear; can you\ntell me the best way to overcome this, and a\ngood lubricant to use that is not easily expelled\nfrom the bearings ?—DEAL.\n\nANSWERS.\nVenetian Blind Lath Planing\nMachine.—In reply to \"Enquirer,\" if you\nwant a machine to do a large quantity, a\npatent machine made by Johnston, Hewetson\n& Co., of Walworth, should suit your purpose.\nThis machine planes three sides of the lath at\none operation, and the other side at another,\nat the rate of 250 ft. per minute. A cheaper\nmachine which planes only one side at a time\nand does not plane the edges is Hazeland's\nPatent. If you did not require a large out-\nput this might answer your purpose.\n\nVenetian Blind Lath Planing\nMachine.—Mr. Chas. Hoyle, of Broadfield,\nRochdale, writes: \"If \"Enquirer\" will send his\naddress to me, I think I can put him in the\nway of getting a good, simple, cheap, and\neffective machine for this purpose, planing the\nlaths as fast as the attendant can place them\non the table.\"\n\nWatertight Cement for Wooden\nCisterns.—In reply to \"B.P.,\" mix lime,\nclay, and oxide of iron in equal quantities.\nMix with water when wanted for use.—B.\n\nProportion of Boiler Chimneys.—In\nreply to \"Matched Lining,\" there cannot be any\nexact rules for the above, as the amount of\nnecessary chimney area depends on a variety\nof circumstances, such as the nature of the fuel,\nthe plan of firing and care of fireman, the\nnature of site surrounding buildings, &c. The\nfollowing is one of the rules published for find-\ning the required chimney area for any boiler:\n—Multiply the nominal horse-power of the\nboiler by 112, and divide the product by the\nsquare root of the height of the chimney in\nfeet. The quotient will be the required area in\nsquare inches. We append a table of propor-\ntions on the American system, and as calcu-\nlated by Mr. Armstrong; we prefer the latter.\nTABLE SHOWING THE PROPER DIAMETER AND\nHEIGHT OF CHIMNEY FOR ANY KIND OF FUEL.\nNominal h.p. of boiler. Height of Chimney in ft. Inside diameter at top. American. Armstrong.\n10 ... 60 ... 1ft. 2in. ... 1ft. 6in.\n12 ... 75 ... 1ft. 2in. ... 1ft. 8in.\n16 ... 90 ... 1ft. 4in. ... 1ft. 10in.\n20 ... 99 ... 1ft. 5in. ... 2ft. 0in.\n30 ... 105 ... 1ft. 9in. ... 2ft. 6in.\n50 ... 120 ... 2ft. 2in. ... 3ft. 0in.\n70 ... 120 ... 2ft. 6in. ... 3ft. 6in.\n90 ... 120 ... 2ft. 10in. ... 4ft. 0in.\n120 ... 135 ... 3ft. 2in. ... 4ft. 6in.\n160 ... 150 ... 3ft. 7in. ... 5ft. 0in.\n200 ... 165 ... 3ft. 11in. ... 5ft. 6in.\n250 ... 180 ... 4ft. 4in. ... 6ft. 0in.\nMr. Armstrong says the proportions he gives\nhave been found to answer well with inferior\nsteam coal.\n\nHeating Buildings.—In answer to \"L.S.,\"\nspeaking approximately, one square foot of\nsteam pipe surface is required for 80 cubic feet\nof space; one cubic foot of boiler is required\nfor 1,500 cubic feet of space. One horse-\npower boiler is sufficient for 40,000 cubic feet\nof space.\n\nShaping Hexagonal Shaft and Table\nLegs.—Mr. John C. Atkinson, timber mer-\nchant, Elswick Saw-mills, Newcastle-on-Tyne,\nwrites:—\"In reply to your correspondent,\n'C.M.R.,' Manchester, I have a machine for\nshaping hexagonal chair legs (12 at once),\nwhich I will sell very cheap, as I have given\nup the business.\"\n\nShaping Hexagonal Chair and Table\nLegs.—In answer to \"C.M.R.,\" Messrs. Rob-\ninson & Sons, Limited, of Rochdale, fit an\napparatus for the above purpose to their cir-\ncular moulding machines when required.\nIt consists briefly of a horizontal cutter-block,\ncarried at the end of a radial overhanging\nbracket, and made to rise and fall on a slide.\nThe leg to be worked is held between two\nheadstocks, one of which is fitted with a\ndividing plate, the cutter-block is fed down past\nthe leg by means of a hand wheel and screw, and\noperates on one side of the leg at once. The\ndividing plate enables the sides of the leg to\nbe accurately set out.\n\nHousing Stair Treads.—In answer to\n\"X.Y.Z.,\" this can be done by means of a cutter\nmounted in an overhead vertical spindle\nafter the manner of a recessing machine, but\nthe slide carrying the spindle should be arranged\nwith lateral and radial movements. The slide\nshould also swing so as to allow the cutter to\nwork at any desired angle and to suit the posi-\ntion of the grooves in the framing. This\napparatus can be fitted to an ordinary vertical\nspindle moulding and shaping machine with\nadvantage, as a large amount of work may be\ndone with it at a considerable saving over hand\nlabour. Consult our advertising columns.\n\nGrease in Feed-water of Boiler.—In\nreply to \"A Subscriber,\" the grease and dirt\nyou speak of in the feed-water is more than\nprobable comes from the engine cylinder, as\nwe presume the exhaust steam is used to heat\nthe feed-water in the usual way. It is a matter\nof very considerable difference of opinion as to\ngrease in the boiler being injurious or other-\nwise; we are decidedly of the opinion that it is\nno good purpose and if it has a tendency to\ncause the boiler to prime. There is also little\ndoubt that it often settles in patches on the\nincrustation and prevents the water reaching\nthe boiler plates, causing them to burn. To\nget over these difficulties and at the same\ntime to effect a considerable saving in fuel, we\nstrongly recommend you to use an efficient\nfeed-water heater and filter.\n\nBUILDING NEWS.\nThe Liverpool Royal Infirmary is to be re-\nbuilt.\nCrediton Parish Church is to undergo res-\ntoration.\nA new Inland Revenue office is to be erected\nat Durham.\nFive cottages are to be constructed at\nLymington, Hants.\nIt is proposed to erect an hotel in College\nRoad, Long Eaton.\nMarkets with arcades are to be erected at\nCarlisle.\nNew cottage homes are to be built at Faz-\nkerley, near Liverpool.\nExtensions are to be made to the St. Cle-\nment Street Public Schools, Aberdeen.\nAdditions are to be made to the Boys' and\nGirls' Department of Stoughton Board School,\nGuildford.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Mrs. H. Cosmo\nBonsor performed the ceremony of opening a\nnew vestry-hall, which has been erected at\nMitcham, at a cost of £3,500. It\noccupies the site of three ancient relics, namely,\nthe parish pound, the \"cage,\" or lock-up, and\nthe parish stocks, which, according to the parish\nminutes, were provided by the lords of the\nmanor 200 years ago.\nA Local Government Board inquiry was\nheld at Bournemouth last week into an appli-\ncation of the commissioners for works of street\nwatering and flushing, and for works of street\nimprovement. For the former item, £7,000\nwas to be borrowed. With regard to the former\nitem, it was stated that the commissioners\nproposed to water the streets and flush the\nsewers with sea water. This application was\nopposed by the Gas and Water Company,\nrepresented by their barrister, Mr. Kydd, who\ncontended that the company were able to supply water for all the\nrequirements of the town, and the\ncommissioners were not justified in ignor-\ning them.\nThe School Board for London sold\nthe following interests in sites purchased for\nsites for schools on terms men-\ntioned:—\nGREENWICH.—Stanley Street.—Owner,\nMrs. M.
