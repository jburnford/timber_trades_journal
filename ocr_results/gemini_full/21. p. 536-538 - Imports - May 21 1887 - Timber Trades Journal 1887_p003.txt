THE DOVER HARBOUR (CORPORATION)
BILL.—Mr. W. H. Crundall, Mayor of Dover,
was examined last week before the House of
Lords committee on the subject of the Dover
Harbour (corporation) Bill. He was under
examination for a considerable time, and
gave the committee much valuable informa-
tion. We understand that owing to an
informality in proceeding with the bill it
has been withdrawn. This, however, will not
prevent the promoters taking action again
next session, which we learn is their intention.

FOREIGN-OWNED SHIPS AND THE TIMBER-
CARRYING TRADE.—In connection with the
circular issued from the Secretary of the Board
of Trade regarding the application to foreign
merchant vessels of the Merchant Shipping
Act, which appeared in the Glasgow Herald, the
following comparative statement, compiled by
Mr. L. G. Belleau, of H.M. Customs, Quebec,
of the number and tonnage of sailing vessels
and steamers cleared from Quebec in the years
1882-86, will be interesting to those engaged
in the timber-carrying trade:—

STRIKE IN THE MATCH TRADE.—On Tuesday
it was reported that 1,200 of the girls employed
in the great match factory of Messrs. Bryant
& May, Bow, had turned out on strike, owing
to a dispute with their employers as to
the deductions from their earnings. The
girls are to be paid on the piecework system,
and from every shilling they earn it is
customary to deduct a penny or twopence,
according to circumstances. It appears that
the old foreman had left the works for some
reason, and the earnings of the girls being
somewhat altered, and the mode of working
being distasteful under the new system, the
hands unanimously resolved to strike until
their original locus standi had been re-
established. If the strike continues very
great distress will follow. So ran the report.
A letter from the secretary of the company on
Wednesday, however, put a different com-
plexion on the matter. It was to the
effect that "On Friday afternoon last, a
foreman of one department resented some
remonstrance from a manager, and resigned
his position, upon which about 100 female
operatives, who had been under his control,
left work, stating as their reason that they
would not work under any other foreman. In
consequence of this partial strike, frivolous and
ridiculous in the extreme, operatives in other
departments were necessarily thrown out until
this morning, when the disaffected ones
returned to work." Messrs. B. Bell & Co., of
Wandsworth, also write to say that, far from
the alleged strike being general in the match
trade, they are in perfect harmony with their
workpeople.

PRACTICAL NOTES
[Our Readers are invited to avail themselves
of this column both to ask questions on all
matters connected with saw-mill and building
machinery and materials, and also to impart
information by replying to the questions asked.
Questions are given one week and the answer
to them in the following issue.]

QUESTIONS.
Silenetic Mortar.—Will you kindly inform
me how the above is made, and is it considered
effective ?—C.C.C.

Lubricating Cog Wheels.—What is the
best and most economical lubricant for the
above ?—S.W.M.

Inlaying Wood by Pressure.—Can you
inform me how the new process of inlaying
wood by pressure is performed, is it considered
effective, and where can it be seen in opera-
tion ?—VENEER.

Continuous Feed Saw-Bench for
Colonial Use.—I hear there is a continuous
feed saw-bench especially adapted for Colonial
use, can you inform me as to how it works and
the name of the maker ?—COLONIAL.

Low Water in Boiler.—What is the
best course to pursue in case of low water in
a boiler ?—TYRO.

Sidewear on Crank-Shaft Bearings
of Deal Frame.—The bearings on the crank-
shaft of my deal frame are constantly giving
trouble through excessive sidewear; can you
tell me the best way to overcome this, and a
good lubricant to use that is not easily expelled
from the bearings ?—DEAL.

ANSWERS.
Venetian Blind Lath Planing
Machine.—In reply to "Enquirer," if you
want a machine to do a large quantity, a
patent machine made by Johnston, Hewetson
& Co., of Walworth, should suit your purpose.
This machine planes three sides of the lath at
one operation, and the other side at another,
at the rate of 250 ft. per minute. A cheaper
machine which planes only one side at a time
and does not plane the edges is Hazeland's
Patent. If you did not require a large out-
put this might answer your purpose.

Venetian Blind Lath Planing
Machine.—Mr. Chas. Hoyle, of Broadfield,
Rochdale, writes: "If "Enquirer" will send his
address to me, I think I can put him in the
way of getting a good, simple, cheap, and
effective machine for this purpose, planing the
laths as fast as the attendant can place them
on the table."

Watertight Cement for Wooden
Cisterns.—In reply to "B.P.," mix lime,
clay, and oxide of iron in equal quantities.
Mix with water when wanted for use.—B.

Proportion of Boiler Chimneys.—In
reply to "Matched Lining," there cannot be any
exact rules for the above, as the amount of
necessary chimney area depends on a variety
of circumstances, such as the nature of the fuel,
the plan of firing and care of fireman, the
nature of site surrounding buildings, &c. The
following is one of the rules published for find-
ing the required chimney area for any boiler:
—Multiply the nominal horse-power of the
boiler by 112, and divide the product by the
square root of the height of the chimney in
feet. The quotient will be the required area in
square inches. We append a table of propor-
tions on the American system, and as calcu-
lated by Mr. Armstrong; we prefer the latter.
TABLE SHOWING THE PROPER DIAMETER AND
HEIGHT OF CHIMNEY FOR ANY KIND OF FUEL.
Nominal h.p. of boiler. Height of Chimney in ft. Inside diameter at top. American. Armstrong.
10 ... 60 ... 1ft. 2in. ... 1ft. 6in.
12 ... 75 ... 1ft. 2in. ... 1ft. 8in.
16 ... 90 ... 1ft. 4in. ... 1ft. 10in.
20 ... 99 ... 1ft. 5in. ... 2ft. 0in.
30 ... 105 ... 1ft. 9in. ... 2ft. 6in.
50 ... 120 ... 2ft. 2in. ... 3ft. 0in.
70 ... 120 ... 2ft. 6in. ... 3ft. 6in.
90 ... 120 ... 2ft. 10in. ... 4ft. 0in.
120 ... 135 ... 3ft. 2in. ... 4ft. 6in.
160 ... 150 ... 3ft. 7in. ... 5ft. 0in.
200 ... 165 ... 3ft. 11in. ... 5ft. 6in.
250 ... 180 ... 4ft. 4in. ... 6ft. 0in.
Mr. Armstrong says the proportions he gives
have been found to answer well with inferior
steam coal.

Heating Buildings.—In answer to "L.S.,"
speaking approximately, one square foot of
steam pipe surface is required for 80 cubic feet
of space; one cubic foot of boiler is required
for 1,500 cubic feet of space. One horse-
power boiler is sufficient for 40,000 cubic feet
of space.

Shaping Hexagonal Shaft and Table
Legs.—Mr. John C. Atkinson, timber mer-
chant, Elswick Saw-mills, Newcastle-on-Tyne,
writes:—"In reply to your correspondent,
'C.M.R.,' Manchester, I have a machine for
shaping hexagonal chair legs (12 at once),
which I will sell very cheap, as I have given
up the business."

Shaping Hexagonal Chair and Table
Legs.—In answer to "C.M.R.," Messrs. Rob-
inson & Sons, Limited, of Rochdale, fit an
apparatus for the above purpose to their cir-
cular moulding machines when required.
It consists briefly of a horizontal cutter-block,
carried at the end of a radial overhanging
bracket, and made to rise and fall on a slide.
The leg to be worked is held between two
headstocks, one of which is fitted with a
dividing plate, the cutter-block is fed down past
the leg by means of a hand wheel and screw, and
operates on one side of the leg at once. The
dividing plate enables the sides of the leg to
be accurately set out.

Housing Stair Treads.—In answer to
"X.Y.Z.," this can be done by means of a cutter
mounted in an overhead vertical spindle
after the manner of a recessing machine, but
the slide carrying the spindle should be arranged
with lateral and radial movements. The slide
should also swing so as to allow the cutter to
work at any desired angle and to suit the posi-
tion of the grooves in the framing. This
apparatus can be fitted to an ordinary vertical
spindle moulding and shaping machine with
advantage, as a large amount of work may be
done with it at a considerable saving over hand
labour. Consult our advertising columns.

Grease in Feed-water of Boiler.—In
reply to "A Subscriber," the grease and dirt
you speak of in the feed-water is more than
probable comes from the engine cylinder, as
we presume the exhaust steam is used to heat
the feed-water in the usual way. It is a matter
of very considerable difference of opinion as to
grease in the boiler being injurious or other-
wise; we are decidedly of the opinion that it is
no good purpose and if it has a tendency to
cause the boiler to prime. There is also little
doubt that it often settles in patches on the
incrustation and prevents the water reaching
the boiler plates, causing them to burn. To
get over these difficulties and at the same
time to effect a considerable saving in fuel, we
strongly recommend you to use an efficient
feed-water heater and filter.

On Wednesday afternoon, Mrs. H. Cosmo
Bonsor performed the ceremony of opening a
new vestry-hall, which has been erected at
Mitcham, at a cost of £3,500. It
occupies the site of three ancient relics, namely,
the parish pound, the "cage," or lock-up, and
the parish stocks, which, according to the parish
minutes, were provided by the lords of the
manor 200 years ago.
A Local Government Board inquiry was
held at Bournemouth last week into an appli-
cation of the commissioners for works of street
watering and flushing, and for works of street
improvement. For the former item, £7,000
was to be borrowed. With regard to the former
item, it was stated that the commissioners
proposed to water the streets and flush the
sewers with sea water. This application was
opposed by the Gas and Water Company,
represented by their barrister, Mr. Kydd, who
contended that the company were able to supply water for all the
requirements of the town, and the
commissioners were not justified in ignor-
ing them.
