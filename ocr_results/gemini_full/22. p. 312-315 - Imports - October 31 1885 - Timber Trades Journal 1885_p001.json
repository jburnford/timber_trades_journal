Comber & Chinery, coach-builders, &c., 20, Euston Buildings, and 20, Euston Mews, Euston Square, N., have dissolved partnership. Debts by John Chinery, who continues the business.\nMessrs. J.

Vine & Gerrard, builders and contractors, 439, Liverpool Road, Islington, have dissolved partnership.\n* * *\nTHE goodwill and stock-in-trade of the business of the late Mr. Wm. Carvill, known as the Rathgar Sawing, Planing, and Moulding Mills, have been purchased by Messrs. Wm. Locke and T. B. M. Woods, who will continue the business under the style of Locke & Woods, timber, slate, brick, and tile merchants, at the Custom House Docks, Dublin.\n* * *\nTHE QUEBEC TIMBER MARKET.—The Quebec Chronicle of October 16th says:—“The timber market at this port still continues in a very dull state. We do not hear of any new transactions.”\n* * *\nA GREAT LUMBERING INDUSTRY.—A despatch from Ottawa says:—“Lumbermen unanimously declare that along the Whanaparae, Spanish Dog and the Michipicotin rivers, north of Lake Superior, will now spring up a great lumbering industry, rivalling that of Northern Michigan. There are said to be the finest forests of pine on this northern continent uncut there. The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway opens the whole district to the markets of the world.”\n* * *\nREMOVAL.—The stores department of the Great Northern Railway has been removed from Peterborough to Doncaster.\n* * *\nWE understand that Messrs. William Baird & Co. of Gartsherrie, have secured a contract from the London and North-Western Railway Company for the supply of a large quantity of creosote oil for timber preserving purposes, for which, we believe, it has been found very suitable. The success of Messrs. Baird & Co. possesses considerable local interest and importance, for their creosote oil is one of the by-products that the firm is now obtaining, under their ammonia-recovery process, from the smoke or gases which used to go to waste at their furnaces at Gartsherrie. It may also be mentioned that the firm is successfully treating this same oil for fuel purposes at their well-known works.\n* * *\nCALIFORNIA REDWOOD.—An American contemporary speaking, of the reception of this wood in the United States, says that particularly in the shape of dimension shingles it seems to be gaining ground in the Chicago and adjoining markets. It is largely used in suburban residences, not only on the roofs but makes it admirably adapted to this use without the addition of paint. Only recently the supply in Chicago was entirely exhausted, and users were obliged to wait for the arrival of consignments. There is also considerable demand for finishing lumber, and redwood is seen in a good many places where two or three years ago it would not have been thought of.\n* * *\nTHE WOODS OF MICHIGAN.—The North-Western Lumberman says:—“There is an unusual stir in the pine land and logging business on the upper Michigan peninsula. The woods seem to be full of pine hunters, numerous purchases of lands and stumpage have been made, and camps are being started in many places. It is the general verdict of late investigators that there is an abundance of excellent pine on the upper peninsula. The shore of Lake Superior is now a favourite field of logging operations. A large amount of pine is to be cut and banked on the lake the coming season, and next year rafted to mills on Lake Huron and in Saginaw Valley. The diminishing supply of high-class logs in lower Michigan is prompting operators to go into the more virgin forests of the upper peninsula, where good timber is yet plentiful.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nIMPORTS.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
