Sandison\nTHE AMERICAN FORESTRY CONGRESS.\nThe fourth annual meeting of the American Forestry Congress began at the Horticultural Hall, Boston, on Tuesday, September 22nd.\nThe association was started on the 25th of April, 1882, at Cincinnati, Ohio, and, like the British Association it is peripatetic in its movements.\nBaron Von Steuben and several prominent gentlemen interested in the preservation of the forests of the continent were the chief movers in the organization of the Congress, which, despite its youthfulness, has already done excellent work in behalf of the cause it has at heart.\nPresident Higley delivered an address.\nHe said: The subject of forestry is of the greatest importance to the welfare of the American people, and they were slowly and steadily becoming aware of the fact.\nOf necessity there must eventually be a national forestry association.\nChina, had she had Prussia's forests, would have escaped her terrible famines and floods.\nChina has made agriculture almost a religion, and has done everything for irrigation, but nothing has proved sufficient to take the place of natural resources.\nHer troubles are largely due to the destruction of her forests.\nThere is abundant evidence in America of the effects of the cutting down of the forests.\nIn Central New York, where this has been done, streams that 30 years ago kept mills going and furnished a never-failing supply of running water, are now dry in summer, yet with the warm rains and thaws of spring overflow their banks; spring is later, peaches will not ripen, droughts are more frequent, and in spring the freshets are very serious.\nThe cutting of trees from the headwaters of streams is also the cause of the difficulty in navigating the large rivers in certain seasons.\nFor two years the engineers of the waterworks of Philadelphia have been looking about in regard to a water supply, and they find that the supply from the Schuylkill has diminished in an alarming degree from the cutting off of the trees at its head.\nIn China and India, in Greece and many other countries, the cutting off of the forests has proved their destruction.\nThe forest areas exercise a positive climatic influence on the surrounding country.\nThey equalize the temperature and the water supply, and agriculture and horticulture are aided and protected.\nPeople live and calculate for the present.\nWe claim, however, that a proper management of the present forests would entail to the present and future generations benefits to all.\nUntil profit will plant trees for such purposes.\nThe Kansas and Nebraska settlers, however, soon found it to their necessity and advantage to plant trees.\nAs a source of profit the raising of trees in Nebraska ranks next to that of stock raising.\nAt the present rate of cutting the trees in the lumber districts the most verdant districts will soon be bare.\nPrussia, from her 6,000,000 acres of State forests, has an income of 7,000,000 dols.\nSaxony, from her 400,000 acres of forests, 1,250,000 dols., and Bavaria, from her 3,000,000 acres, a profit of 4,500,000 dols.\nThe forests of Alsace and Lorraine are equally profitable.\nDuring a period of 120 years these forests are depopulated and again repopulated.\nIn New England and the Middle States forests may be renewed with little trouble.\nA protection of worn-out fields from cattle and the planting of a little seed will work wonders.\nA valuable farming country should have 25 per cent of its area in forests.\nOur forests suffer a terrible\n\n315\nloss from fire and browsing animals; in 1880 over 10,000,000 acres were thus destroyed.\nThe railroads of this country in their building have used in ties alone the product of an area larger than Rhode Island and Connecticut.\nEstimating that ties need to be renewed on an average, once in seven years, there must be drawn from the forest annually 86,571,428 ties, requiring the timber growing on 568,714 acres.\nAllowing 30 years as the time necessary to produce trees of proper dimensions for ties, it will require 16,971,420 acres of woodland to be kept constantly growing as a kind of railroad reserve in order to supply the annual needs of the existing roads.\nThis constitutes an area larger than the States of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts combined, or the States of New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware, with the addition of Connecticut.\nIt is more than 4 per cent. of the total area of woodland in the United States, exclusive of the Territories, and 3 per cent. of the area in the States and Territories together.\nWith the rapid extension of our railroad systems, these figures will be proportionately increased.\nWe need in the schools a systematic training in forestry.\nArbor Day has done a great work in the West, and has been of the greatest use in awakening an interest in trees.\nBut whatever you would have appear in the nation's life must be taught in the public schools.\nGeneral instruction on the subject of forestry should be given, and every agricultural school should give the subject a prominent place.\nThe national Government still owns about 85,000,000 acres of forest lands.\nThese are without protection against the depredations of lumbermen.\nMany 100,000 dols. worth of timber are stolen annually, and the destruction by fire is going on unchecked.\nPortions of these forests lie on the head waters of the most important rivers of the continent, and their destruction would cause incalculable loss to the nation.\nAt the afternoon session the chief of the forestry division of the Department of Agriculture, the Rev. N. H. Egleston, read an instructive paper on \"Facts in regard to the present state of American Forestry.\"\nHe said:—\nIgnorance prevails throughout the country on the subject of forestry, and therefore it is most difficult to get at facts relating to the matter.\nOur country is so large and so much of it is still unsurveyed that this is not to be wondered at.\nThe Government survey has not been made to find out the fertility of the soil.\nAn unwarrantable discrimination has been made in respect to lands supposed to contain minerals, their sale and appropriation having been restricted, while every indulgence has been given to the miners.\nAlthough the value of the products of the forests, as given by the last census, was nearly tenfold that of all our mines of silver and gold, the miners have been allowed to cut down the forests on the public lands at their pleasure, and without any payment, for the purpose of furnishing themselves with timber and fuel for their mining operations.\nWe have altogether overestimated our mines and underestimated our forests.\nA volume of the last census report on the subject of forestry was prepared by Professor Sergeant, and was the first of its kind.\nIn questions brought up by this volume much information has been gained.\nOur whole area of land surface, Alaska being left out of consideration, it will be seen, is 1,856,070,400 acres.\nThe total forest area is 440,990,000 acres.\nThe total farm area is 225,650,000 acres.\nOf unimproved and waste lands, including \"old fields,\" there are 1,115,430,400 acres.\nIn regard to the consumption of our forests, we have some very significant, if not startling, figures.\nThe census reports the consumption of 145,778,137 cords of wood and 74,000,000 bushels of charcoal for fuel in dwellings, stores, factories, steamboats, and locomotives.\nThis would clear the forests in a single year from an area of 30,000,000 acres, about equal to that of New York or North Carolina.\nThe census also reports that in 1880 forest fires consumed the trees on 10,274,068 acres, or an area equal to that of Massachusetts combined, and there is no reason to think, judging from the reports of fires thus far, that a less area will be burned over this year than in 1880.\nThe census gives the amount of lumber cut in 1880 as 18,000,000,000 ft.\nLast year the cut had increased to 28,000,000,000 ft., which would lay bare an area of 5,600,000 acres, equal very nearly to that of New Hampshire, wood products of a miscellaneous character, and those of which we have but few definite reports will consume the trees, we may reasonably suppose, on 4,260,000 acres.\nThus it appears that the forests",
