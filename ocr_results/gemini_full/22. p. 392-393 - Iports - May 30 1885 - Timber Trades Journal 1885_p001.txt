STACKING.
SHIPOWNERS will be glad to learn from our Liverpool Journal of Commerce correspondent that they are enabled to report the termination of the dispute at Hartlepool between the shipowners and timber porters have been settled, and that the men are now alongside of the steamers discharging timber. It is generally accepted that the men have been induced to make stipulations as to the mode of discharging floating timber.
The Sunderland Shipowners' Society have been reporting the recent decision in the case of the Volga, a Great Yarmouth timber-laden steamer. The clause had been inserted in the charter, "The parties this season have mutually agreed to establish a custom of stacking deals, battens, stack, and pile timber, and also of piling laths and boards on the quay at the consignee's expense, suitable to the requirements of the port," but the shipowner contended that this was in lieu and instead of discharging on to the quay in the manner formerly. The custom of the port was proved, a fact should be borne in mind by shipowners, and for the information of those interested in the question may not be out of place to state that we should here state that when a similar stipulation is inserted in a charter-party for any other mode of lading, to make a custom of the port, such as stacking, it cannot be held to be binding upon them. This was the case with the charter-party of the steamer Volga. In this instance the steamship was chartered to load a cargo of deals at Cronstadt for Great Yarmouth. The cargo was shipped from Riga to Hull, and the consignees claimed from the Humber the consignee's right to stack the timber. The owner of the Volga, according to the custom of the port, was bound to stack the timber. The master of the Volga, however, first, refused to deliver the cargo unless the consignee dicated, but finding that the consignee was determined to receive the cargo in the customary manner, after the second day's demurrage, discharged the load. Between the ship and the stack of timber was a distance of 80 ft., and the shipowner refused to provide suitable stages and men to carry the cargo over. The owner of the cargo, therefore, had to provide them at a cost of £20 10s., and the consignee for two days' demurrage.
The consignee relied on the custom of the port of Hull, and the jury found that such a custom existed. Mr. Justice Manisty, however, entered the verdict for the shipowner.
On May 10th, 1877, the case was argued before the Lord Chief Justice and Justices Mellor and Brett in the High Court of Justice, and the Court held that the strict words of the contract was too definite to be overridden by any control and override it. The Court held that the words—" the cargo to be taken from alongside the ship at the merchant's risk and expense"—were too definite. The judges were unanimous in their opinion that the expense of piling and staging the timber from the latter as the ship rose out of the water ought to be borne by the receiver of the cargo. It would appear that the timber trade customs of the east and north-eastern ports are very similar.
