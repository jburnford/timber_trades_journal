L. Johansen & Co.\nSTACKING AND RAFTING OF TIMBER.\nSHIPOWNERS and merchants, says the Liverpool Journal of Commerce, have not been enabled to agree as to the stacking or rafting of timber.\nThe custom of ports differs widely.\nAt Hartlepool, Hull, and Yarmouth the importers have declined to take delivery from alongside of ships in accordance with the generally accepted usage.\nIt has been sought to make shipowners find dogs, ropes, and raft floating timber.\nAt a recent meeting of the Sunderland Shipowners' Society the secretary reported the receipt of a communication from a Great Yarmouth merchant, stating that a clause had been introduced into charter-parties this season, the effect of which was to establish a custom for steamers to land, stack, and pile their cargoes of deals, battens, and boards on the quay in the position suitable to the merchant, and thus put the shipowner to an additional cost, instead of discharging over the ship's rail as formerly.\nThe chairman proposed that the fact should be communicated to the press for the information of shipowners.\nAs this question may not, however, be understood, we should here state that unless a stipulation is inserted in charter-parties or bills of lading, to make shipowners pay for stacking, it cannot be made a charge on them.\nThis was made clear in the case of the steamer Volga-Holman v. Wade.\nThe ship was chartered to convey a cargo of timber from Riga to Hull.\nOn arrival in the Humber the consignee requested the master to stack the timber on the quay, according to the custom of the port.\nThe master, at first, refused to deliver in the manner indicated, but finding the consignee was determined to receive the cargo in no other way, after the second day he commenced to unload.\nBetween the ship and the quay there was a distance of 30 ft., and it was necessary to provide suitable staging to pass the timber over.\nThe owner of the vessel then sued the consignee for two days' demurrage and the cost of delivering the cargo on to the quay.\nThe consignee relied on the custom of the port of Hull, and the jury found that such a custom existed.\nMr. Justice Manisty, however, entered the verdict for the shipowner.\nOn May 10th, 1877, the cause was heard by the Lord Chief Justice and Justices Bramwell and Brett in the High Court of Appeal.\nThe Court held that the strict letter of the contract was too definite to let in custom to control and override it.\nThe charter contained the words-\" the cargo to be brought to and taken from alongside the ship at the merchant's risk and expense as customary.\"\nThe judges were unanimous in holding that the expense of piling and staging, and changing the latter as the ship rose out of the water, should be borne by the receiver of the cargo.\nIt would appear that the timber merchants at the east and north-eastern ports, or some\n\n393\nof them, have hit upon a plan whereby the cost of stacking will be cast upon shipowners.\nIf shipowners are willing to bear the charge, they are at perfect liberty to do so; but judging from the proceedings we have quoted they are not.\nIn a charter, not long since, it was provided that the cargo was to be taken from the ship's tackle at the port of discharge free of risk and expense to the ship.\nThe merchant insisted that the master should stow the goods in railway trucks, which he declined to do, and an action was threatened; but the matter was settled by reference in favour of the shipowner, and all costs paid, without carrying the case into court.\nTimber should be tallied, and possession taken over a ship's rail or outside the ports, unless there is a condition in the charter that the master is to pile or remove the cargo.\nOne merchant endeavoured to compel the master of a vessel to find men to carry deals from the ship's side to his yard.\nA foreigner unacquainted with law and the construction of charter-parties may be persuaded to incur expenditure, on the ground that it is customary to defray landing charges; but though the merchants in any particular trade may agree among themselves to make shipowners do certain work, their resolutions cannot be urged in a court of law with the least chance of success to set aside the express terms of a written agreement.\nThe timber trade of Liverpool notified that deals, ends, battens, boards, and scantling, when landed on the quay, would be counted on the ends with a hammer daily, and struck to denote delivery by the ship, and that a receipt would be given if required.\nThe mate, or a representative on the part of the shipowner, it was mentioned, should attend at the counting, and that shipowners should arrange with stevedores to land the timber on the quay in tiers of uniform number, and in such a manner as to be correctly counted, and any wood not so landed should be at the risk of the vessel.\nThis is a trade custom; but it would depend upon the language of a charter whether this system could be made compulsory.\nThe shipowner is paid freight for conveying to the place of destination, but it is not for him to attend the delivery and tally the goods should at all times be taken from the ship's side.\nClaims for short delivery arise through the clandestine removal of timber from quays and piles.\nWatchmen do not see all that takes place.\nShipowners and merchants in these contracts of affreightment should understand their respective liabilities.\nBut resolutions passed at meetings of shipowners or merchants can possess no valid effect unless their substance is incorporated in written contracts, and even then they must not be too vague.\nA NEW RAILWAY.-The new railway connecting Swanage and Corfe Castle with the main line from Waterloo to Weymouth was opened recently.\nROSEWOOD.-Rosewood trees are found in South America and the East Indies and neighbouring islands.\nThere are half a dozen kinds.\nThe name is not taken from the colour of the wood, as is generally supposed, but by reason of a rose-like fragrance which it possesses when first cut.\nSome of the trees grow so large that planks 4 ft. broad and 10 ft. in length can be cut from them.\nThe broad planks are principally used to make tops for pianofortes.\nThe rosewood tree is remarkable for its beauty.\nSuch is its value in manufactures as an ornamental wood that some of the forests where it once grew abundantly have now scarcely a single specimen.\nNew plantations have been set out, so that the supply will not be exhausted.\nSETTING BOILERS.-A mistake which is frequently made in setting boilers, says the Locomotive, consists in loading them down on top with a great mass of brickwork, which often does more harm than good.\nOf course coverings are much to be preferred to brick, some good non-conducting covering is necessary if we wish to attain a high degree of economy, but for boilers of small or comparatively small diameter.\nIt is no unusual thing to find boilers of this type with several tons of brick and mortar piled on top, which load the boiler has to carry, in addition to its own weight, on two supports, perhaps at the extreme ends.\nIn such cases the girth seams generally show distress near the centre of the shell, where the greatest strain comes.\nWe would recommend some good light covering, made in sections so that it can be easily removed, without destroying it, for purposes of inspection, and as easily replaced.",
