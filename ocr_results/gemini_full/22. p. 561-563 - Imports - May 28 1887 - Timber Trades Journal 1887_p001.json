  "text": "MAY 28, 1887.\nthe honour of publicly exhibiting match manufacturing processes for the first time in England; for although Her Majesty's Jubilee year is only a year or two beyond the Jubilee of match manufacture, we have not heard of such an exhibit up to the present time. In the Saltaire Exhibition, stand 253, court 7, may be seen splint, box shaving, and box cutting and match filling machines in full operation, excepting only the paraffining, phosphorus composition dipping, which for very apparent reasons could not be carried on in an exhibition. The space occupied, 34 ft. by 20 ft., is occupied by two splint machines, two skellet machines, filling machine, two circular saws, and cistern for steaming wood, which, being an entire novelty to the public, attracts a good share of attention, and is calculated to increase the popularity of Barner's matches, which, delivered by waggons, have a large sale in the populous West Riding district of Yorkshire, as well as by rails to the surrounding counties. The manufacturers claim by their flaking and matching processes that the straightest and best-grained splints can be produced, as the grain of the wood is not broken as by the longitudinal lance-cutting machines, and the wood can be cut closer to the knots more economically than by any other method. The old method of cutting the shavings, and then stamping them by hand, has been entirely given up by them, and shavings from 5 to 12 in. can be seen pouring forth from their diagonal knife after the cutting and scoring machines 250 per minute, all ready for slicing into strips for insides, and pasting together for outsides of the match boxes. A filling machine shaking the splints into brass grooves, and then drawing them out at once upon laths also grooved to receive each splint; then screwed firm upon each other in an iron frame, prepares about 2,500 splints for dipping well and firmly separated from each other. Thus, as we have said, the whole process of match manufacture, except dipping, is shown. The True Blue, and Sunflower matches made by the firm, familiar to many thousands, will, we trust, become known and used by thousands more who will doubtless be interested by the firm's exhibit at Saltaire.\nMessrs. Harrison & Singleton, timber merchants, Valley Road, Bradford, have supplied the flagstaff in the grounds, from which the Royal Standard proudly floats.\nBobbins, tubes, spools, spindle brooches, &c., are exhibited by Messrs. Wilson & Kenyon, Cornholme Mills, Todmorden; Messrs. Dixon & Sons, Steeton via Leeds.\nMessrs. Robert Dempster & Son, of Elland, Yorkshire, show three sizes of their Hall's Patent Gas Engine.\nMessrs. Brunton & Trier, 19, St. George Street, Westminster, make an exhibit of their patent grindstone dresser, on which we have already favourably commented. The machine is shown in operation, and visitors are thus afforded a practical demonstration of its capabilities.\nMessrs. John White & Sons, have an excellent exhibit of driving belts, &c., made from walrus hide.\nThe Keighley Timber & Sawing Company show specimens of their turnery, their exhibit at the Manchester Exhibition described in our issue of the 14th inst. They exhibit two very artistic ventilating window screens, associated with wood, stained glass effects, and suitable for dining-room, boudoir, drawing-room, and all other windows. The transparencies are applied by a patent process on the reverse side of the glass, and all the usual troubles and water marks avoided to the utmost. By this a perfect picture is presented through the glass, and all the usual destruction from one window to another is avoided.\nAt the annual conference on Saturday of the South Wales Quarrymen's Union it was stated that the quarry trade in North Wales was very bad, the only quarries working full time being Llanberis. At Lord Penrhyn's quarries, and at Festiniog, the men were only working half time. It was stated that a great improvement was needed.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
