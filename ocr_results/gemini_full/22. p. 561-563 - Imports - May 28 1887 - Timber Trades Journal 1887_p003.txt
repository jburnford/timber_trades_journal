PRACTICAL NOTES
QUESTIONS.
Sandarach Gum.—From what tree is the sandarach gum obtained?—H. A. P. B.

Speed of Plane Irons.—What is the correct speed for the cutting edge of plane irons ?—T. S. S. (Manchester).

Sawing Frozen and Wet Logs.—What form of log frame do you recommend as the best and most reliable for the above purpose—one capable of cutting logs up to 36 in. diameter and carrying say 12 saws without slipping?—Moscow.

Trenching Sash Sills, &c.—What is the best way to do the above, and can it be done on a tenoning machine? Is there a cheap machine made which will plane and take long stuff out of "wind"? I am acquainted with the ordinary travelling table trying-up machine but it is too expensive and occupies too much space for my purpose.—W. M. (London).

Proportion of Boiler Chimneys. — On page 538 you give some proportionate heights and diameters of chimneys. In a situation where a high chimney is objectionable (because of intercepting a view), kindly say if increased area will compensate for reduced height. For instance: if instead of 100 ft. high, by 2 ft. diameter, I wish to substitute one of 50 ft. high, will it answer with an increased diameter, and if so, what diameter is recommended?—S. M. W.

Seasoning Timber.—We should feel greatly obliged if, through the medium of your Journal, you or any of your numerous readers can inform us what is now considered the most practical and approved apparatus for drying wood (Baltic yellow and white), such as is used in the manufacture of joinery. We should require to dry a large quantity annually, say 576,000 loads. Can you inform us what system is used in America by joinery manufacturers there?—A SWEDISH SUBSCRIBER.

ANSWERS.
Selenitic Mortar.—In reply to "C.C.C.," this is the invention of General Scott, R.E., and consists of the ordinary ingredients of mortar, viz., lime and sand, though the sand is in larger proportion than usual, with the addition of a small quantity of gypsum (sulphate of lime) very intimately mixed with the lime. This mortar requires to be mixed in a pug mill very thoroughly, and when carefully prepared will be found to have acquired, to some extent, the properties of cement, for it sets rapidly, and when set it is extremely hard and tenacious. It is to the admixture of the gypsum that the rapid setting is due.

Lubricating Cog Wheels.—In reply to "S.W.M.," for lubricating gearing, wooden cog wheels, &c., try a thin mixture of soft and powdered blacklead.—B.

Inlaying Wood by Pressure. — In answer to "Veneer," we understand this process consists in glueing a veneer of the wood to be inlaid over the common wood, and placing a zinc stencil plate with the pattern cut out of it over the veneer, then subjecting the whole to the softening action of steam and the pressure of two powerful cast iron rollers. These rollers crush the zinc stencil into the veneer, and the underlying veneer into the common wood. The stencil is then withdrawn, and the embedded portion of the veneer is planed down till the inlaid surface is perfectly smooth.

Continuous-feed Saw Bench for Colonial Use.—In reply to "Colonial," you probably refer to Messrs. Robinson & Son's bench. This can be used for breaking down timber, cutting deals, and flatting. The timber is fed to the saw by means of two plain horizontal rollers, one at each end of the bench. The feed power is given to these rollers by means of the pressure caused by the action of the saw whilst cutting. This is said to be quite sufficient and to give a regular efficient feed. The driving of the feed rollers can be reversed at a quick speed.

567
Low Water in Boiler.—In answer to "Tyro," in case of low water, immediately draw the fire, or, if the furnace crown be red hot, cover the fire with ashes or earth, or, if no ashes are at hand, use fresh coal. Do not turn on the feed under any circumstances, nor tamper with or open the safety valve. Let the steam outlets remain as they are. If cold water be let into the boiler an explosion may result or the boiler collapse. Large boilers should in all cases have two water gauge glasses fitted to them in case of one becoming stopped up; this is particularly necessary where impure feed water is used.

Side Wear on Crankshaft Bearings of Deal Frame.—In reply to "Deal," we do not know of any remedy except by putting in liners, but all the best frames are now made with the bearings arranged to allow for the side wear arising from the pulling in one direction, dividing the bearings unequally, and tapping a set screw or screws through the pedestal to set them up. We think it would pay you to have a new set of bearings, to a new set of bearings, to lubricate with a mixture of lard oil and blacklead, say three of the first to one of the latter. Keep the bearings fairly screwed up but not too tight.

We have to announce the death, on Saturday last, at his residence, No. 30, Devonshire Place, of Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect. Sir Horace had been confined to his house about a fortnight, but his illness was not deemed serious, and his decease, which will be much regretted by the Corporation of London and by the profession of which he was an able and distinguished member, will come to many as a painful surprise. Sir (then Mr.) Horace Jones was elected City Architect in 1864, on the death of Mr. Bunning, and nearly all the important architectural works which since then have been executed by the Corporation were designed by him. Among these may be mentioned the London Central Markets at Smithfield, Billingsgate and Leadenhall markets, the Guildhall library, reading-room, and museum, and the new council chamber at the Guildhall, admittedly one of the finest buildings of the kind in the kingdom. He also designed in conjunction with Mr. J. Wolfe Barry, C.E., the bridge over the Thames at the Tower which is now in course of construction, at an estimated expense of £800,000. The much criticised memorial at Temple Bar was also his design, though to his credit it must be said that he made it as sightly and as compact as his instructions admitted. For two recent years he served the office of President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and on his retirement from that office he received the honour of knighthood. A fine portrait of him by Mr. Ouless, R A., is in this year's exhibition of the Royal Academy. By his death the lucrative and important office of City Architect becomes vacant.
