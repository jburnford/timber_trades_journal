WAWMAN.—The first meeting of the creditors of William Wawman, of Hamilton Road, Felixstowe, Suffolk, late of Pitlake Bridge, Croydon, builder, was held at the London Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday, before Mr. F. Messent, the Official Receiver for Ipswich. The accounts filed by the debtor showed liabilities to the amount of £7,200 9s. 6d., and assets nil. The Official Receiver appended the following observations:—The debtor presented a petition for liquidation in the Wandsworth Court in November, 1880, and under that petition Mr. H. A. Dubois, accountant, Serjeants' Inn, Chancery Lane, was appointed trustee. The debtor states that all his assets at that time were taken possession of and sold by the trustee, but he has never heard of any composition or dividend having been paid, and that the only debts he has contracted since November, 1880, are for materials supplied to finish existing contracts which he ordered by direction of Mr. Dubois. The debtor's statement of affairs is made out from the printed statement issued in December, 1880, and is probably subject to considerable modification through Mr. Dubois's transactions, but the debtor asserts that he is unable to give any information respecting them. Mr. A. G. Ditton and Mr. S. Ward appeared for creditors. The following creditors proved:—\n£ s. d.\nRowan & Son ... ... ... ... 279 1 6\nDavis H. & C. & Co.... ... ... 132 2 7\nFarmiloe T. & W. ... ... ... 106 0 1\nFreeman J.

It was also resolved that the proceedings be transferred from Ipswich to the London Court.\nWATSON, SMITH, & WATSON.—This failure occurred a few months since, the debtors trading as railway contractors at Ethelburga House, Bishopsgate Street Within, and application was made to the Court on Tuesday for the approval of a scheme of arrangement agreed to at the first meeting of creditors. The joint liabilities amounted to £22,363, and the accounts showed a surplus subject to realization. By the resolutions the property was to vest in and be administered for the benefit of creditors by Mr. J. W. Sully, accountant, Queen Victoria Street, as trustee, acting under the supervision of a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Alfred Conder, of Crown Court, Old Broad Street; Mr. A. J. Atkey, 33, Cornhill; and Mr. Montagu Hawkins, representing Theodor Bertschinger. The Official Receiver reported that the failure of the firm appeared to be mainly attributable to their inability, owing to the prevailing\n\nGANDY'S PATENT AMERICAN COTTON BELTING,\n90% STRONGER and much CHEAPER than LEATHER or INDIARUBBER.\nThoroughly waterproof and not affected by temperature—\nWorks well crossed and between forks—\nDoes not slip, but clings well to the pulleys—\nThe strain is evenly distributed over the whole of the belt—\nTherefore it has a perfectly smooth drive—\nWorks well in heat and damp—\nStretches less than any belting made—\nHas stood the severest tests for 10 years—\nHas been awarded 22 Prizes for excellence.\nFOR SAMPLES, PRICES, AND ALL INFORMATION APPLY TO\nMAURICE GANDY,\nWORKS—LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND; 130, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, LONDON, E.C. and BALTIMORE, U.S.A.\n\nFIRE BRICKS—GLAZED\nGOODMAN & CO.\nSole Agents in London for { E.
