WAWMAN.—The first meeting of the creditors of William Wawman, of Hamilton Road, Felixstowe, Suffolk, late of Pitlake Bridge, Croydon, builder, was held at the London Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday, before Mr. F. Messent, the Official Receiver for Ipswich. The accounts filed by the debtor showed liabilities to the amount of £7,200 9s. 1d., and assets nil. The Official Receiver appended the following observations:—The debtor presented a petition for liquidation in the Wandsworth Court in November, 1880, and under that petition Mr. H. A. Dubois, accountant, Sergeants' Inn, Chancery Lane, was appointed trustee. The debtor states that all his assets at that time were taken possession of and sold by the trustee, but he has never heard of any composition or dividend having been paid, and that the only debts he has contracted since November, 1880, are for materials supplied to finish existing contracts which he ordered by direction of Mr. Dubois. The debtor's statement of affairs is made out from the printed statement issued in December, 1880, and is probably subject to considerable modification through Mr. Dubois's transactions, but the debtor asserts that he is unable to give any information respecting them. Mr. A. E. Britton and Mr. S. Ward appeared for creditors. The following creditors proved :—\n£\nNewton S. & Son ... ... ... ... 279\nBrown H. & C. & Co. ... ... ... ... 132\nCornelius T. & W. ... ... ... ... 106\nPound, Son J.

It was also resolved that the proceedings be transferred from Ipswich to the London Court.\n\nWATSON, SMITH, & WATSON.—This failure occurred a few months since, the debtors trading as railway contractors at Ethelburga House, Bishopsgate Street Within, and an application was made to the Court on Tuesday for the approval of a scheme of arrangement agreed to at the first meeting of creditors. The joint liabilities amounted to £22,863, and the accounts showed a surplus subject to realization. By the resolutions the property was to vest in and be administered for the benefit of creditors by Mr. J. W. Sully, accountant, Queen Victoria Street, as trustee, acting under the supervision of a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Alfred Conder, of Crown Court, Old Broad Street; Mr. A. J. Hawkey, 33, Cornhill; and Mr. Montagu Hawkins, representing Theodor Bertschinger. The Official Receiver reported that the failure of the firm appeared to be mainly attributable to their inability, owing to the prevalent\n\nAMERICAN BELTING,\nINDIARUBBER.\nperature—\nthe pulleys—\nof the belt—\nve—\nting made—\nr excellence.\n\nO DY,\nET, LONDON, E.C.\n.A.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\ndepression in the financial markets, to realize their assets, which consisted almost entirely of bonds, stocks, and shares accepted by them in payment of sundry contracts; and that, considering the nature of such assets, the proposed scheme, which admitted of the gradual liquidation of the estate, appeared to be reasonable, and calculated to benefit the general body of the creditors. Mr. J. Davis appeared for the trustees, Mr. Aldridge for the Official Receiver, Mr. H. Reed, Mr. Kimber, and Mr. L. Davis on behalf of creditors. There was substantially no objection, and Mr. Registrar Hazlitt made an order approving of the scheme.\n\nGEORGE PARFITT.—This bankruptcy has been previously reported. The debtor is a builder of Ewshott Hill, near Crondall, Hants. The sitting for public examination was held at Guildford Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday, before the Registrar (Mr. Hugh F. Day). The debtor stated that he had been in business for twenty-seven years, and started with no capital. The examination was principally with regard to some property which had been left to the debtor's wife by her mother absolutely, and who, it had been discovered, had executed a deed, under which the debtor had a life interest in the property. On this had been erected four houses, and a mortgage for £700 obtained on it. Bankrupt professed ignorance of the existence of the deed, and stated that the only deeds he signed were relating to the mortgage. On being pressed, he admitted having stated that he had an interest in the property, but it was his wife's. He knew he had something in it. His wife collected the rents, but the mortgagee was now in possession. He did not think the property would realize the amount of the mortgage, although only four houses had been erected. There were other buildings on the land. He had no account of the money expended on the property. He could give no detailed account of how he had expended the moneys he had received during the twelve months prior to the granting of the receiving order. They amounted to £1,100, but he had no entries relating to the work in his books. Had sent a horse and cart to one of his creditors who had obtained a judgment against him. He was still living at Ewshott, the his sons and daughters having bought in most of the goods.\n\nJ. A. WARRINGTON.—The debtor, John Alfred Warrington, of 75, Rhodeswell Road, Limehouse, builder, trading as John Martin, filed his petition on October 12th, and the first meeting was held on Wednesday before Mr. Wildy, Assistant Receiver. The debts were stated in the accounts at £406 9s. 1d., and the assets at £122 9s. 3d., the following being scheduled as creditors :—\n£ s. d.\nAshton & Green (Lim.), Bury Street, E.C. ... 10 1 9\nBowles —, Salmon's Lane, E. ... ... ... 16 8 4\nCalman & Co., Commercial Road, E. ... ... 12 14 9\nCalverley H., Bromley ... ... ... ... 162 14 9\nDean H., Limehouse ... ... ... ... 30 0 0\nMountford —, Limehouse ... ... ... ... 35 10 0\nSankey & Co., Canning Town ... ... ... 29 5 1\nWessen —, Stainsby Road, E. ... ... ... 30 4 10\nWilliams & Co., Cubitt Town ... ... ... ...\nThe Official Receiver reported that the debtor filed his petition in the name of John Alfred Martin, but it afterwards appearing that his true name was John Alfred Warrington, he was required to amend his petition. He states that he commenced business under the style of John Martin in 1876, without capital, and that in his business dealings he has been known by that name only. He attributes his difficulties chiefly to losses on contracts, to costs of unsuccessful litigation in connection therewith, and other causes. A scheme of arrangement was proposed for the sale of the estate to two of the debtor's friends for £90, the money to be deposited with the Official Receiver. The proposal was agreed to.\n\nWM. BENNETT.—An adjourned meeting for public examination was held in this case on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard.
