THE JUBILEE: A PRACTICAL SUGGESTION.
This is the title of a letter addressed to the Editor of the Times, by "A Country Doctor," who says:—There appear to be two desiderata wanting in the present arrangements for celebrating the Jubilee—viz., consentient action and permanence of effect.
Bonfires, illuminations, dinners are all very well in their way, but are so very transient in character.
What I would suggest is that at a certain stroke of the clock on a certain day (say three, on Tuesday, June 21st) every village in the kingdom should make its little procession of school children and loyal inhabitants, with band and banners, to the village green or common, and there plant an oak. The local magnate might give a short oration, or the clergyman an address, but, at any rate, all could join with heart and voice in the National Anthem.
The spectacle of a whole nation at the same moment breathing forth its loyalty in tuneful prayer for blessings on its Sovereign would be a sight for the gods, and could hardly fail to be pleasing to one so pre-eminently sympathetic as our Queen has always shown herself to be.
The oak is an emblem of permanence, for, as the old song says—
"Then still flourish he,
"A hale green tree,
"When a thousand years are gone."
and in Headcorn Churchyard there still stands one which is stated to be over one thousand years old, and looks like lasting a good many years yet.
As these oaks grow and become known in every village as the "Jubilee" or "Victoria" oaks they would act as constant reminders to the wives and daughters of many future generations of a Queen who placed before herself a high ideal and lived up to it, and stimulate them to emulation of her virtues. And as the men are very much what their mothers and wives make them, in this way the whole moral tone of the Briton of the future would be sweetened, purified, and elevated by the Royal exemplar under whose beneficent sway our own happy lot has been cast. Thus the good the Queen does would live after her, and not be "interred with her bones."
The whole expense for tree, fencing, and an inscriptive plate would be but a few shillings and within the means of the poorest village in the land. No lord of the manor could be imagined refusing a site for such an object. And should it be objected that this is the wrong season to plant a tree, an oak branch placed in the ground at the ceremony by the leading

lady of the village would serve the purpose, and the tree itself could be planted at the same time.
Of course, if our fellow-countrymen residing in the colonies should join in the demonstration, where not prevented by climatic or horological difficulties, the moral effect, both now and hereafter, would be vastly enhanced.
I will not further encroach upon your valuable space, as I think I have written sufficient to point out a practical way in which the match may be applied to the smouldering mass of loyalty in the country, all eager to burst into flame and blaze forth a beacon to the whole world, and leave its mark upon the nation for all time.”

PRIVATE BILL LEGISLATION.—A work on Private Bill Legislation for solicitors and engineers who are engaged in the promotion of Provisional Orders, will shortly be issued by Messrs. Crosby Lockwood & Co., entitled "Handbook for Solicitors and Engineers engaged in promoting Private Acts of Parliament and Provisional Orders for the Authorisation of Railways, Tramways, Works for the Supply of Gas and Water, and other undertakings of a like character." The work is by Mr. Livingston Macassey, of the Middle Temple, Barrister-at-law, and member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and will comprise about 950 pages, with marginal notes, copious index, &c.
THE TIMBER TRADE OF ITALY.—Before the present tide of industrial development in Italy had set in, says Industries, the country was one of the best wooded in Europe; but here, as elsewhere, a somewhat reckless policy of spoliation, pursued at first, had to give way to more economic methods, and thus we find exports steadily decreasing whilst imports are on the increase. The figures for 1885 and 1886 are respectively :—Exports, 4,500,000 and 4,300,000 cub. ft. ; and imports, 29,000,000 and 47,000,000 cub. ft.
