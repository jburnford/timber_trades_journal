LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
AN APPEAL AGAINST A COMPENSATION AWARD.
KELLY & SON v. C. LENNON.
In the Dublin Court of Exchequer on Wednesday, a cause, Francis J. Kelly, trading as Kelly & Son, appellant; Catherine Lennon, respondent, came on for hearing before Baron Dowse on appeal from a decision of the Recorder of this city. This action was brought under the Employers' Liability Act, 1880, by the widow of Richard Lennon, against the appellant, the proprietor of the City of Dublin Saw Mills, Thomas Street, Dublin, for damages for injuries sustained by her husband on the 23rd of January last, while in the appellant's employment as painter, at St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, by reason of the negligence of the appellant in the construction of a scaffolding erected on the large staircase of that institution, under the supervision of the appellant's foreman, from which the respondent's husband fell and received injuries which resulted in his death on the 23rd March last, for which the Recorder gave a decree for £187 10s., a sum equal to two years' wages, with £10 expenses, and £5 costs. His Lordship, in affirming the Recorder's decree for the full amount, directed that a sum of £50 should be invested for the use of an infant child of the respondent, born since the passing of the Recorder's decree.

REDUCTION OF THE SWEDISH EXPORT.
The management of Stockholm Wood Exporters' Union has again begun its labours, says the Svensk Travaru Tidning, to endeavour to bring about the absolutely necessary agreement among exporters for a diminished output for next year. So far the union has not definitely decided on the means for the reduction, but as the work is already begun, all might well be settled before the meeting in January.
As it is well known what great trouble the managers had to bring about the last convention, and how nearly it was upset by the attitude of a few members, we hope that exporters, seeing the use of the reduction this year, will meet the management, and as much as possible lighten its work. The advantages obtained by this reduction are for every right-minded individual evident enough, as the prices obtained would hardly have been got had not foreign buyers known that a seriously-meant agreement had been entered into, and that stocks would be reduced. If one compares wood prices with those of other goods, it will be found that although the wood trade cannot boast of a really good year, yet it has been a relatively a fairly good one. From all consuming countries the news has been continually reaching us that building schemes are neglected, and that the disposal of wood goods was extremely limited ; further that houses which formerly speculated are now compelled to buy only just what they want. But in spite of all this what have been tolerably good, and those prices must be carefully and justly think over things. The confidence this last convention of wood exporters inspired abroad that has been the cause.
With such conditions before our eyes we hope that exporters as numerously as possible
