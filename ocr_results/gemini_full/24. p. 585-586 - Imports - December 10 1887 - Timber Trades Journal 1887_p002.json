The failure is attributed to bad trade and bad debts. The debtor appears to have carried on business at his present address since he commenced about twenty years ago, at which time he had a capital of about £30. He now swore to the accuracy of the usual memoranda on the file, and was informed that he had passed his public examination.\nCAPPER, C. J., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, timber merchant.—A private meeting of the creditors of C. J. Capper, trading as Rennoldson & Capper, was recently held at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and was largely attended. The chair was occupied by Mr. A. C. Slee, of the firm of Messrs. Boyson & Slee. After going very fully into the statement of affairs presented, which showed liabilities £7,380 and assets £950, and hearing Mr. Capper's explanations as to various matters in connection with his estate, it was unanimously resolved to accept a composition of 2s. in the pound, payable by the debtor's promissory note at two months from the date of the meeting, to be secured to the satisfaction of the Chairman, Mr. Brandt, and Mr. Bertram.

Dore & Son), builder.—The meeting of the creditors herein was held at the London Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday, before Mr. A. Mackintosh, Official Receiver for Brighton. The statement of affairs showed liabilities to unsecured creditors £4,918 12s. 6d., creditors fully secured £12,280 18s. 11d., estimated value of securities £12,280 18s. 11d., and assets: stock-in-trade at cost £1,590, estimated to realise £795, book debts good, £537 1s. 2d., household furniture and other property £4,599, total £6,001 1s. 2d., less preferential claims £19 0s. 6d., leaving net assets £5,982 0s. 8d., deficiency £1,063 8s. 2d. The debtor commenced business in Eastbourne ten years ago with a capital of £70. During a considerable time his speculations were profitable, but lately house property has seriously depreciated in value, and it is doubtful whether on the twelve houses owned by the debtor and mortgaged for £12,600 there will not be claims by the mortgagees. The Official Receiver reports that he is afraid the debtor has considerably underestimated the amounts required to finish the contracts. The Chairman now reported that the valuation of the contracts showed that the surplus would be about £200 less than the debtor estimated. A cheque for £500 was received by the debtor within a few days of the receiving order, and this was paid to an aunt on condition she advanced debtor a further sum. It would be for the trustee to look into the matter. Replying to a question, the Official Receiver said at the present time it was impossible to realise house property in Eastbourne. A proposal for a scheme of arrangement was made on behalf of the debtor by his solicitor. The debtor was examined as to the £500, and he said that at the time he paid his aunt (Mrs. Hilliott) he owed her £350, and she had given him £140 from this since paying the cheque. He paid out a sheriff's execution and wages with the money. The first loan he had from his aunt was ten years ago—an amount of £100—and since then he had been receiving rent of two houses for his aunt, but had been allowed to retain the money till such time as he could conveniently pay her. A full account of these transactions appeared in the books. His son, James Dore, had been in his employ as a clerk, at a wage of 25s. per week. He was not a partner, but the name \"Son\" was added to make the firm look large. Could not say if the son had signed any contracts in addition to him (witness). His son had no assets. He did not disclose the payment of the £500 to the Official Receiver, and said he thought it only proper till this morning. He did not learn it from the debtor himself, having received an intimation from a gentleman of the fact. The Chairman said that, with reference to the scheme of arrangement, if the same were accepted the trustee would have no power to examine into and investigate the payment to Mrs. Hilliott. He thought that was a very serious question. The principal trade creditors having supported the scheme proposed, the same was agreed to, and Mr. Fredk. George Clark (Edmonds, Clark, & Co., chartered accountant, Post Office Chambers, Ship Street, Brighton) was appointed trustee, and Messrs. Lavey, Sunder, Butt, T. West, Duffield, and Beves were appointed the committee of inspection. The Chairman, in reading over the proofs, said that many of them were for amounts in excess of those stated by the debtor, but he explained that several invoices had not been received.\nDRAPER, JOSEPH, of Battersea, case maker.—In this matter, previously reported in the Journal (on the occasion of a meeting of creditors at the Cannon Street Hotel), the proceedings, as we then announced, had been stayed, the debtor filing his petition in bankruptcy. This week the official details are to hand. The gross liabilities £5,972 19s. 8d., creditors fully secured £4,093 13s. 9d., creditors partly secured £1,361 15s. 2d., estimated value of securities £1,361 15s. 2d., creditors partly secured £227 0s. 8d., total amount expected to rank £1,642 16s. 11d. The details of the assets are as follows:—Cash £162 5s. 6d., stock-in-trade £1,200, trade fixtures, and fittings £400, furniture and property £580 12s., book debts £258 12s. 1d., ditto doubtful £33 10s. 5d. Total of £2,601 1s. 6d., reduced to £2,565 9s. 1d., by the deduction of preferential claims, leaving the deficiency £1,063 8s. 2d. A list of creditors has already appeared in the Timber Trades Journal. The receiving order was made, according to the report of the Official Receiver for the debtor's own petition on the 14th November last, on the debtor's own motion; and on the application of certain creditors the Official Receiver was appointed Mr. E. Foreman, of 57, Gracechurch Street, E.C., chartered accountant, special manager to manage and carry on the business of the debtor, reserving to himself the right to sell. Mr. Foreman from such office states that he should be of opinion that his continuance is unnecessary or unprofitable to the estate. The Official Receiver also states that the business of the debtor is that of a fire-wood merchant and packing-case maker. The debtor commenced business about ten years ago, and in 1881 he had a capital of £1,000. He has kept a cash book, journal, and ledger book, which had been balanced by his son (manager for Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co., East India Avenue). The principal creditors fully secured are Mr. J. W. Page, of Norwood Park Estate, who holds a lien on two horses for horse hire. Messrs. Duus, Brown, & Co. hold a lien on the debtor's premises (including lease of house, &c.) granted by Mr. J. T. Carr, of Pimlico, for a term of which 18 years are unexpired at a rental of £360. They hold security for the sum of £1,333 15s. 2d. for goods sold and delivered. Creditors partly secured are:—Messrs. Stevenson & Bryant, Limited, of 155, Fenchurch Street, E.C., who hold a lien on goods lying in their merchant's Mill, Verney Road.",
