The liabilities were £1,151 7s. 6d., and a dividend of 1s. 8d. in the pound has been paid, the outstanding assets being of uncertain value. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt commenced business about ten years ago without capital, and he attributed his failure to losses on contracts. His books of accounts did not sufficiently disclose his transactions and financial position, and the Official Receiver submitted that the bankrupt’s remaining in ignorance of the loss on his trading and of his financial position had resulted from his neglect to properly investigate his affairs. Mr. Tanner appeared for the Official Receiver, and Mr. Upton for the bankrupt. Mr. Registrar Giffard suspended the order of discharge for four months.\nBEESTON, E. J.—This failure was reported last week. The sitting for the public examination was held at the Southampton Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, before Mr Registrar Davis. At the first meeting of creditors it was decided to adjudicate the debtor a bankrupt, and Mr. Ambrose Bennett, accountant, of Portland Street, Southampton, was appointed trustee with a committee of inspection consisting of Messrs. T. C. Eliott, timber merchant, Britannia Wharf, Southampton; J. J. Ploughman, financial agent, Southampton; and J. Beeston, undertaker, East Street, Southampton. Mr. J. C. Moberley, Official Receiver, appeared on behalf of the Board of Trade, and Mr. W. J. H. Bull for the debtor. Answering to questions put by the Official Receiver, bankrupt said the greater part of the debts had been incurred since he went to Winsor. His father had nothing to do with the business, and, in fact, persuaded him to have nothing to do with it. The estate had been valued by Mr. Morris and Mr. Burrough Hill. Mr. Hill's valuation in February was £2,250, but in April he increased that by £250. The Mr. Brown referred to had held positions in Borneo, and he (bankrupt) acted as attorney for him, paying his debts and so on, receiving remittances from the London office. He should think he owed him £150 on the account between them, and he also owed him money advanced on the security of a life policy and interest. He did not know where Brown was now, and could not find out. He expected to have received an instalment from him, and also £200 in December, as he had had money left him on the death of a brother in America, about £10,000. He last heard from him in April, he being then at Margate. He was Colonial Secretary for the British North Borneo Company, and prior to that was Governor of the Gold Coast. The Registrar pointed out that there was no deficiency account filed, and the Official Receiver said the statement of affairs showed a surplus. The Registrar said he could not pay his debts, and must file a deficiency account of some sort. The examination was adjourned.\nBLUNDERFIELD & HIDE, builders, Hammersmith.—This case has been previously reported, and the meeting for the debtors' public examination was held on Wednesday, before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The accounts showed total liabilities £31,746, of which, however, only £2,413 are unsecured, and a surplus is shown in assets, subject to realisation, of £1,955. In reply to the official solicitor, Blunderfield said that he began business in 1880 with £500 capital, and Mr. Hide brought in a like amount. They built about 70 houses at Fulham and Hammersmith, raising money on them as they went along. They borrowed altogether about £29,000. Nine of the houses were sold, but being unable to realise or to borrow further were brought to their present difficulties. In March 17th they sold an engine for £60, which they handed to their solicitors in payment of money lent. They had no idea at that time that they were in serious difficulties or would have to come to the Court. The trustee (Mr. William Rooke) was also in attendance, and Hide having been examined, his Honour ordered the examination to be concluded. The bankrupts passed accordingly.\nCHURCH, JOHN, builder and contractor, 12, Coleman Street, E.C.—The receiving order in this case was made on April 19th, the debtor trading as Church & Co., and the first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday, before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £1,743 3s. 1d., and the assets at £191 11s. 3d., the following being scheduled as creditors:—\n£ s. d.\nBraby F. & Co., Euston Road ... ... 50 6 0\nBenfleet Brickworks Company ... ... 44 2 0\nBrown J., 103, Cannon Street ... ... 29 11 10\nBussell, Gibbs, & Co., Wells Street, W. ... 21 16 11\nBarker J., Tottenham ... ... 18 10 8\nBurton P., 38, Barnham Gardens, W. ... 14 3 6\nBushell H., Finsbury Pavement ... ... 74 3 0\nCadney C.

The debtor stated that in 1879, on the failure of the West of England Bank, he presented a petition for liquidation at Newport (Mon.), under which, he believed, 20s. in the pound was paid, and he obtained his discharge, after which he came to London, and had acted as foreman to various firms. In June, 1884, he commenced his present business with £1,000, derived from his wife, out of which he paid £725 for an assignment of an interest in a building agreement for premises in Tabernacle Walk, but which had to be abandoned in consequence of his failure to get the same financed. It further appeared that the debtor had since August, in conjunction with a Mr. J. C. Pawley, undertaken certain contracts, which he had been unable to complete, his interest thereunder being thereby forfeited; also that in September, 1886, he purchased the Empire Steam Joinery Works for £250 (still included in the liabilities), in respect of which the landlord distrained upon and sold the effects, he (the debtor) giving up possession of the premises. He attributed his failure to consequence of pressure by creditors and want of capital, also to losses in connection with the Empire Steam Joinery Works, and with the Tabernacle Walk agreement. He had not been required to file a deficiency account. In reply to the chairman, the bankrupt said that he had been adjudged bankrupt, and some discussion of a proposal to make place with reference to the appointment of a trustee. Ultimately the estate was left in the hands of the Official Receiver.\n\nJUNE 11, 1887.\nCAREY, H. G., builder, Hammersmith.—The bankrupt attended at the London Bankruptcy Court, on Thursday, before Mr. Registrar Barker, for adjourned public examination. The proceedings had been adjourned from a previous sitting for the production of a cash account, which was not, however, now forthcoming. The Official Receiver said he did not propose to examine to close with the bankrupt, and he therefore applied for an order concluding it, which was granted.\nCOLE, R.D., builder, Ryde.—This bankrupt attended at the Isle of Wight Bankruptcy Court, on the 2nd inst., before Mr. Registrar Blake, for his public examination. Mr. Wheeler, for the bankrupt, said he had no further questions to ask, and Mr. H. R. Hooper, therefore, applied that the debtor might be allowed to pass his public examination. Mr. J. C. Mould, for a dissentient creditor, offered no opposition, and the Registrar acceded to the application.\nDEAN, SAMUEL, cabinet-maker, West Gate, Cleckheaton.—The public examination of this debtor took place at the Bradford Bankruptcy Court, before Mr. Registrar Lee, on the 3rd inst. The Official Receiver, Mr. A. Binks, stated that the debtor was described as a joiner, builder, and cabinet-maker. For twenty-two years ago, with £100 capital, he had carried on business at his present address since 1870, and for the previous eight years he had practised as a joiner and cabinet-maker. His turnover had of late not exceeded £400 or £500 a year. Ultimately, the debtor was allowed to pass his examination subject to his signing a transcript of the notes of the examination.\nDOREY, FRANCIS, builder, Westbourne Park and King's Cross.—This case was in the list last week, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Tuesday before Mr. Brougham, Assistant Receiver. The liabilities were returned in the accounts at £504 19s. 7d., and the assets at £360 12s. 4d., the following are among the creditors :—\nElalberg —, Wardour Street, W.\nReves —, timber merchant, Brighton\nBanks —, Blackheath Road, S.E.\nDorey Mrs., Honor Park Road, S.E.\nGoodenough E. W., Great St. Helen's\nHunt, Kennard & Co., Clement's Lane\nHickmott & Co., Mile End\nLloyd —, King's Cross\nPressland —, Sutton\nSannderson & Co., Hull\nSpencer —, 124, St. James's Road, S.E.\nWilliams & Co., Camberwell\nIn the absence of any satisfactory proposal on the part of the debtor, the case was left for bankruptcy, and the Official Receiver will wind up the estate.\nEUSTACE, J. J., & CO.—This firm, the partners of which are Joseph John Eustace and John Dinan, trading as timber merchants at Leitrim Street, Gt. George's Street, Cork, have submitted a statement of affairs to their creditors, of which the following is an abstract:— Liabilities to unsecured creditors, £10,032 19s. 11d., to partly unsecured creditors £6,633 6s. 8d., the value of the securities being estimated at £3,975 15s. 6d., thus leaving a balance of £693 11s. 2d. to rank against the estate for dividend, to liabilities for which debtors received no consideration, being for acceptances for the account of other firms, £3,322 14s. 5d., and to liabilities on bills £3,000, out of which £2,655 2s. 10d. is expected to rank against the estate, total £18,579 8s. 4d. Assets: stock-in-trade, £18,579 8s. 4d.; produce £4,744 10s. 11d., books debts expected to produce £1,796 8s. 6d., cash at bankers £12, and with the official assignee £51 12s. 1d., total £6,595 18s. 7d., showing a deficiency of £11,977 15s. 9d. Debtor's proposal is to pay 5s. in the pound by three instalments, the first instalment of 2s. to be lodged with the official assignee within a month after the confirmation, the remaining two instalments of 1s. 6d. in the pound at four and eight months. The following are creditors:—\nTucker Ernest H., London\nBoard G. H. H., Cork\nSaunders M. & Son, Cork\nTomkins W. G. & Son, Cork\nAllen Richard & Co., Cork\nMorgan J., Smith, & Co., Cork\nMcDonald H., Saltcoats\nSimon Henry, Manchester\nDoulton & Co., London\nCutherall & Co., Buckley\nBrown & Co., Bridgwater\nColthurst, Symons, & Co., Bridgwater\nPerry H. & Sons, Buckley\nGraham Wm., Dublin\nMartin Richard, Dublin\nMartin T. & C., Dublin\nOwnenham, Chapman, & Co., Sheffield\nBowen Henry H., Ruabon\nSmith Mrs. Kate J., Cork\nHarvey James A. & Co., Cork\nMr. Wreford said that he had received several resolutions from creditors, but as the various resolutions could not be reconciled, and the creditors, therefore, could not agree, he would, therefore, have to report as stated that in 1879, on the failure of the West of England Bank, he presented a petition for liquidation at Newport (Mon.), under which, he believed, 20s. in the pound was paid, and he obtained his discharge, after which he came to London, and had acted as foreman to various firms. In June, 1884, he commenced his present business with £1,000, derived from his wife, out of which he paid £725 for an assignment of an interest in a building agreement for premises in Tabernacle Walk, but which had to be abandoned in consequence of his failure to get the same financed.
