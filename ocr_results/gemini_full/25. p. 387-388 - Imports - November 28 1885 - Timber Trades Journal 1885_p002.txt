AFRICAN SNEEZEWOOD.
SNEEZEWOOD is perhaps the most valuable tree in South African forests, and it is one of the most durable woods in the world, ranking in this respect equally with jarrah and greenheart. The actual durability of the wood is unknown. As fencing posts it has been used since Natal and the eastern portion of the Cape Colony has been colonized. Fencing posts used on the oldest farms remain quite sound to the present day. In speaking of sneezewood posts and poles, it is, of course, necessary to distinguish the heartwood from the sapwood, the latter being no more durable than the heartwood of any other tree. Thus in telegraph poles made of young sneezewood sapwood have been found to fail in a few years. Specimens were sent to the Edinburgh Exhibition quite sound at the present day, and cut from marine piles that had been twenty years under sea-water, and partially immersed.
Sneezewood is untouched by the tropical white ant and the marine borers, which play such havoc with many woods.
The habitat of sneezewood is the east of the colony and Natal, from sea level up to elevations in the Amatola of 4,500 ft. It is stated to exhibit its best growth in the moist climate of Natal. In the Cape Colony it is most abundant in the eastern coast forests, but the largest trees are found in the mountains, where it attains dimensions of 3 ft. in diameter and 60 ft. in height. The natural reproduction of sneezewood is usually abundant, especially in the coast forests sneezewood seedlings suffer severely from dew, which is especially injurious to the young leaves.
Sneezewood has a small crown and light aromatic taste of its covert, with white bark resembling that of black ironwood. In the mountains it loses its leaves in the winter, and in the climate of the eastern coast the foliage becomes scanty. The seed of sneezewood is small and winged, like many of the pines. It is somewhat difficult to collect and preserve, as it is ripe at Midsummer, a time of the year when it is exposed alternately to scorching winds and heavy rain. Sneezewood takes an excellent polish, and planks show a beautiful mottled curled grain, resembling satinwood, and have been cut from old Sneezewood is not adapted for framing on account of the facility with which it splits; but this facility of splitting is of great service for the use to which sneezewood is commonly put—the split poles for fencing. Cut poles of sneezewood are not recommended, for the reason that, when very young, the proportion of heart in a pole is very small, while when old the contrary takes place.

THE WOOD TRADE OF WURTEMBERG.
The manufacture of furniture generally is chiefly carried on in the capital, where it gives employment to some 2,000 hands. The better class of goods is of excellent workmanship, and commands a well-deserved reputation. Sculpture in wood, for church purposes, enjoys a large export and home market, and parquet floorings are extensively manufactured in every variety of wood, and largely exported to all parts of the world. Wood-turnery and toys give very large employment, and are sent to all countries. There is also a large trade in fancy goods, boxes, pipes, &c. Vats, casks, and brushes for the toilet, barrels are extensively manufactured, and there is a firm of cork cutters in Nuttingen which exports largely to Austria and South America.
In the year 1884 the wood-sawing trade was in a satisfactory condition, owing to the reduction in the price of manufactured goods and the consequent enlargement of existing or the establishment of new manufactories. The factories of Stuttgart, tory at Ravensburg, which exports largely to England and Holland, describes the condition of the trade as decidedly depressed, owing to the reduction in prices and the difficulty in securing results. The furniture manufactories suffered a great deal, and tained on the whole reasonages consequent upon the unfavourable results of the larger establishments. Some were affected by the strike in the carpet-weaving trade, which impaired the market, and competition was also felt from the raising of the wages in Berlin and Paris, but the general industry was unaffected by the change. Export was chiefly with Spain, South America, Italy, and Belgium. The trade in clock-cases and wooden frames remained for the most part unaltered, but there was a slight improvement in price in certain instances.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases the creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
T. H. J. JACKLIN.—The debtor who is a builder, &c., at Brighton, presented himself at the Brighton Bankruptcy Court on Thursday for his adjourned public examination. Mr. A. O. Jennings, Registrar, presided. The Official Receiver (Mr. A. Mackintosh) asked for a further adjournment, stating that the matter still remained in abeyance. It was hoped that 20s. in the pound would be paid, and that something would be left for the debtor. This application was granted. Later on in the day an adjourned meeting of creditors was held at the offices of the Official Receiver. It will be remembered that a sum of £200 had been left to the debtor, and that he was also entitled to a reversion, valued at about £600. The two wills under which the debtor was entitled to these benefits were not proved, and before anything could be done these would have to be proved. At the first meeting it was decided that this should be done, the Official Receiver receiving a security for the necessary costs. It was now stated that the wills had been proved at a cost of £20. The meeting was then adjourned for the purpose of a scheme of arrangement being formulated.
T. H. ENTICKNAP.—The first meeting of the creditors of Thomas Henry Enticknap, builder and contractor, of Wrecclesham, near Farnham, was held at the Town Hall, Farnham on Thursday. The statement of affairs filed disclosed liabilities to unsecured creditors £560 13s. 4d., other liabilities £12, total £572 13s. 4d., and assets, stock-in-trade at Wrecclesham, estimated cost £300, to realize £175 3s., book debts (good) £147 2s. 6d., doubtful and bad £44 10s. 8d., estimated to produce £13 8s. 11d., household furniture, estimated to realize £12 10s., and other property (horse, cart, and harness) £24 17s., total £373 1s. 7d., deduct amount due to preferential creditors for rent, rates, taxes, and wages £33 10s., leaving net assets £339 11s. 7d., with a deficiency of £233 1s. 9d., which is accounted for by loss on various contracts undertaken by the debtor.
