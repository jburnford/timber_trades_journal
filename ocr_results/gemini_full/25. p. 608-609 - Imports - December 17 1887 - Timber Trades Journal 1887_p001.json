The outlook for mining timber is good; no further import having been made, stocks are not heavy, and what there are being held tightly. Prices are very firm with an upward tendency, 28s. being the price to-day. The debenture wood market remains unchanged.\n\nOf the timber and deal trades there is nothing fresh to report. There are still two or three cargoes of Swedish red deals to arrive, but practically the import season is at an end.\n\nThere are two large contracts to be given out shortly; one for a warehouse to be built on the jetty of the new Roath Dock, and the other for a new goods station for the Great Western Railway, but these works are not likely to be commenced till the spring.\n\nIt seems now to be definitely settled that the Dowlais Iron Company are coming to Cardiff. Having leased a large piece of land from the Marquis of Bute, they are at present sinking trial pits for a foundation, with a view to erect blast furnaces.\n\nSCOTLAND.\nIn every branch of leading industries we are glad to see very marked indications of reviving trade; especially is this the case during the last week or two. The reports of the iron market, which to a large extent guides the other industries, are very satisfactory, showing a gradually increasing price. The activity in the market seems warranted by the improvement in many branches of the iron trade. The copper excitement continues, and the value still goes up and keeps firm.\n\nThe improvement in the sugar trade has been no less marked, a gradual advance during the last two months of between 3s. and 4s. per cwt. having been secured. In this case this advance has, no doubt, been obtained to a great extent owing to the large reduction of stocks held as compared with last year and the small estimate of the present year's crops, but, were not a revival of general trade apparent, the exceptional rise and the great firmness displayed could not be maintained.\n\nOther industries have similar reports to make, and although with these directly we are not immediately interested, we may fairly congratulate ourselves on the prospect that the circle of revival is now within a short reach of the timber trade, and even now the general steadiness of work apparent in the saw-mills at this season of the year shows satisfactory signs that improved business is beginning, and at the recent public sales the competition has been less restricted and transactions more numerous, the merchants holding goods much more firmly. The recent extensive advance in Baltic freights certainly increased the cost of winter stocks, and to reimburse themselves holders must hold out for an equivalent increased retail price, but that this should be so readily obtained gives evidence of a current of improved trade.\n\nMentioning this matter of the recent advance of freights also brings forward this hopeful feature, that there has been given an impetus to the shipbuilding trade, which so much affects the timber trade, and the genuineness cannot be doubted when we see looked for orders for new ships being received by shipbuilding firms vouchsafing work for lengthened periods.\n\nAltogether we must feel hopeful of the future, judging from all these satisfactory reports of the near approach of those good times for which the timber trade has so long and so anxiously looked.\n\nIn looking at the stocks of the great timber depots in Scotland we are inclined to think that our annual review in January will bear reports that they will generally be under the average, and that every circumstance indicates an early all-round rise in the prices of timber.\n\nGLASGOW.\nWithin the past week there have been two public sales of deals held here by brokers, prices at which are noted below. The goods offered on 9th inst. consisted chiefly of a cargo of lower port pine deals lately landed, and a large proportion found purchasers, and since the auction further sales have been made privately, leaving, we understand, only a few lots 2nd quality to be disposed of.\n\nThe catalogue for sale of 14th inst. comprised Michigan and Ottawa yellow pine deals, a large assortment of the various qualities, also red pine deals and Quebec spruce deals.\n\nAlthough there was a full attendance of the trade and evident disposition to purchase, the bidding for the greater part of the deals offered did not meet importers' limits, the goods being firmly held, and comparatively few lots changed hands. Broad 3rd pine deals being very scarce brought high prices, as will be seen undernoted.\n\nThere have been no arrivals of importance to note during the past week, small parcels of oak planks and staves, &c., being the only items. Statement of stock will be made up in a fortnight from now, and, as regards log timber generally, will be exceptionally small. On stocks of pitch pine and teak a large depletion will, no doubt, be shown compared with quantity when last quarterly statement was submitted (30th September), as there have been no arrivals of these woods since then, and meantime large quantities have gone into shipbuilders' hands, and a decided improvement has taken place in values of wood for shipbuilders' requirements.\n\nThe balance of mahogany, per *Hedwig*, to which reference was made a week or two ago as being still in first hands, is now all disposed of.\n\nAUCTION SALES.\nOn 9th inst., at Glasgow, Messrs.

Park, Dobson & Co. Although the shippers of Swedish goods from Drontheim always maintain that the quality and bracking of their productions are equal to the stocks shipped at Sundswall, buyers are not easily convinced of this, as the shipments via Drontheim rarely come up to best Sundswall shipments either in quality or average length. The parcel per *Tronda* (s), however, is a very fair shipment.\nThere has been less doing here this week in the way of selling, no public sale having been held, and the orders coming in through travellers and otherwise being decidedly less numerous. In all likelihood this falling off will become more pronounced until after the new year.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[*For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
