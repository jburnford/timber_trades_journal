Wright & Nephew\nLEGAL INTELLIGENCE.\nA DISPUTED ACCOUNT.\nTHE PULSOMETER ENGINEERING COMPANY v. THE IMPERIAL SAW-MILLS COMPANY.\nOn Friday this case was again resumed. Mr Frank Norton Best, secretary and manager of the defendant company, stated that he was present at an interview between Mr. Radcliffe, the chairman of the defendant company, and Mr. Brindley, in November, when a discussion took place as to taking water from the Lea to the two condensers. Witness inquired of Mr. Brindley what they would do when the river ran dry, and he replied that the \"Robey\" could draw water from the well which had been laid down for the injection of water into the veneer engine. The original invoice from the plaintiffs, which was for £292, was received in January. After its receipt he saw Mr. Brindley, and explained that he was astonished at the amount, adding that when Mr. Radcliffe saw it there would be a fine row. Mr. Brindley said that he thought there must be a mistake, and that he would take back the invoice and look into the matter. The invoice was subsequently returned unaltered. Witness first showed the invoice to Mr. Radcliffe in March. When he (witness) inspected the pipes and joints, he found them very faulty. Some of the pipes had been suspended with rope or twine. As a matter of fact the machinery had never acted properly. They had never been able to get the two engines to work together for any length of time. The vacuum index attached to the engines was extremely variable. In cross-examination witness admitted that he was not an engineer, but said he knew a great deal about machinery. He was the secretary of the company, and did a good deal of travelling, but he visited the saw-mills every morning, and superintended the working of them. When he received the first invoice for £292, Mr. Radcliffe was in Scotland, and although he thought it was £192 too much, he did not occur to him to write to Mr. Radcliffe about the matter. He did not write to the plaintiffs' firm about the invoice. It was about a month since he discovered that the pipes were suspended with rope. In re-examination witness said he had nothing to do with the",
