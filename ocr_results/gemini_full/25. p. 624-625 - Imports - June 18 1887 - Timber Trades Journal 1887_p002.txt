THE Secretary of the Swedish and Norwegian Railway Company (Limited) informs us that they have received the following telegram from Lulea, Sweden:-" Lulea, Sweden, June 11th, 1887.-A great fire took place in the town last night, burning the church, hotels, and sixty of the largest houses. The Swedish and Norwegian Railway Company's office escaped, as also that of their head manager, but all, the other English residents were burnt out."
