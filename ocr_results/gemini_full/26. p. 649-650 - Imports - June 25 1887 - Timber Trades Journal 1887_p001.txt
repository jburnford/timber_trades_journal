SCOTCH LAW CASE.
AN ESTATE TRANSACTION.—MITCHELL v. LORD TRAYNER.
In the Outer House, Lord Trayner, Matthew Mitchell, timber merchant, Glasgow, sued Alexander Mitchell, timber merchant, Alloa, for £3,000. While the respondent was in Norway, summons was edictally served. The defender made a claim for £3,000, the sum alleged to have been lost by him in consequence of his having been induced to become a shareholder of the Vaagsoeter Company (Limited). That company, the pursuer said, was induced to purchase the estate of Vaagsoeter, in Norway, from the respondent, through the alleged false and fraudulent representations and concealments of material facts on the part of the respondent. Decree was obtained for the sum sued for, and it is now the complainer (respondent) who is responsible on any of the claims made against him, and asserting that he was abroad right after a committee of the shareholders was appointed, and under the advice of an Edinburgh lawyer, maintained that he was not liable for the charge sought to be enforced. The case was brought into court in the beginning of 1885, and in May of that year the Lord Ordinary granted the decree in absence, which was extracted, and the whole grounds of the present action, and found the complainer (the original pursuer) entitled to expenses. On a reclaiming note to the Second Division in January, 1886, their lordships recalled the Lord Ordinary's interlocutor, and remitted the case back to his lordship for proof.
The case came up for the case-to-day, a voluminous proof having been led partly before him, and partly on commission.
His Lordship had now to consider two questions—first, whether the complainer had a good title to sue; and second, whether he had made out his claim of damages. First, he was of opinion that as a debenture holder the complainer had no title to sue, because he was not a creditor of the company in any reasonable sense. On the other hand, differing from the respondent, his Lordship was of opinion that as a shareholder of the company the respondent (the original pursuer) had a good title to sue this action, assuming that he had a good title to sue. If he had a good title to sue this action, there remained the question whether he had made good his right to the sum of damage which he now claimed. The representations complained of related—first, to the extent of the estate; second, to the character of the timber thereon; third, to the value of the iron ore on the estate; and fourth, to each and all of them, it being averred by the proof that they were in-correct in point of fact. The estate was not so extensive, the timber thereon not so numerous, and

the ore not so valuable as was understood to be represented by the complainer, but that the discrepancy between the representations and the facts would not per se entitle the respondent to damages. It must be shown that they were made by the complainer them knowing them to be false, or that he had reasonable ground to believe them to be untrue. His Lordship dealt in the first place with the representation concerning the extent of the estate, and as the result of a detailed examination of the evidence, he came to the decision that he could not hold the complainer's representations to have been false or fraudulent. The information he proceeded upon in making his representations was, so far as he could judge, quite reliable and trustworthy, and he made the representations in good faith. As regards the timber growing on the estate, his Lordship was of opinion on this part of the case that the complainer took means to ascertain with fairness and approximate accuracy the state of the timber which he believed, and had reason to believe, to be the truth of the information on that subject supplied to him; that he communicated it to the respondent and his cedents the information as he received it; that he made no false or fraudulent representations thereanent; and that he did not conceal any of the information in his possession which was calculated to influence the purchases. Dealing with the third point, his Lordship said that the iron in question no doubt contained iron ore, the only question was whether the complainer's representations as to the percentage of ore obtained were false and fraudulent. It was not disputed that samples of iron ore were found on this estate; that they were handed to the chemists for analysis; and that the analyses obtained from the chemists were truthfully communicated. On this part of the case, also, he was of opinion that the respondent had failed to prove his allegations. But the complainer maintained that he was entitled to have the decree suspended on two other grounds, the first being that the respondent and others who joined him were not induced to purchase, and did not purchase, in reliance on the representations of the complainer, but purchased on the reliable information which they procured for themselves. His Lordship thought it was out of the question to say that the company was formed or the property purchased in reliance on the statements or representations of the complainer. So far from that being the case, the gentlemen forming the company sent gentlemen of their own choosing to ascertain for them everything about the estate. Upon their report the company was formed, and if by them they had been led into a bad bargain the complainer was not responsible for that. So far as he could see, the respondent and those acting along with him risked nothing on the representations of the complainer, except the expense of obtaining this report. There remained only the question whether the respondent and the company discharged the complainer of all claims arising out of the purchase of the Vaagsoeter estate. He had considered all the evidence, and the result he had arrived at was favourable to the complainer's contention. His Lordship's judgment was in favour of the complainer, and he accordingly suspended the decree complained of with expenses subject to some modification.
