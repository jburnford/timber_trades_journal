Questions are given one week and answers are given to them in the following issue.]\n\nQUESTIONS.\nDrying Stoves.—Any information will be welcome as to the best form of stove for timber and joiners' work, heated by using waste materials from a joiner's shop, and moulding machines, &c.—PRIMUS.\n\nSaws v. Cutters for Tenoning.—What form of machine do you recommend as the best and most accurate for tenoning purposes, that in which saws are employed, or that in which cutters are used? In France a good number of machines are used in which cutters are employed, but a friend has recommended us to use a cutter machine for a large amount of very accurate work we have to do. Before deciding, we should be glad to have the opinion of the London Timber Trades Journal, or of any of its practical readers on the subject.—A. ET CIE (Marseilles).\n\nANSWERS.\nDressing Spokes by Cutters with or Across the Grain of the Wood.—In reply to “Spoke,” although a large number of machines have been made with cutters working with the grain of the wood, the general consensus of opinion is now in favour of the plan of working across the grain of the wood. The chief advantages claimed for the latter system are that the wood is much cleaner under the cutters and is much less liable to splinter when working cross-grained or knotty wood. At the same time, articles in which there is a sudden change of form, such as gun stocks, can be much more readily worked. In turning light stuff there is also less liability to break. There is little doubt that, with good, straight-grained wood, cleaner work can be turned by working with the grain than across, but the advantage is more than counter-balanced by the drawbacks we have stated.\n\nSubstitute for Turkey Oil-stones.—In answer to “T.S.R.,” a good Turkey oil-stone is almost invaluable in a saw-mill or where edge tools have to be sharpened, and if carefully used will last a long time, and a good piece in the end will be hardly more expensive than cheaper stones, which, as a rule, do not last long. If you wish to try a substitute you may try a Charnley Forest, a Water of Ayr, or a Washita stone, and see which suits you best. Sperm or neatsfoot oil can be used for sharpening, but for fine work some operators now use alcohol instead of oil, but we have not tried it ourselves.\n\nFiring Steam Boilers.—In reply to “Burton,” if you will refer to back issues you will see we have already given a number of notes on the above. We may, however, say briefly, fire regularly, after firing open the ventilator door for a minute or so. Keep the bars covered up to the bridge. Keep the fire even and bright, and do not put on too much at once. Keep the fire clear of clinkers, but do not be constantly breaking the fire up.\n\nTenon Cutter with Saws.—In answer to “One in a Dilemma,” it is not an easy matter to say what is wrong in the working of your tenon saws without seeing them at work. Possibly you have not enough set on the teeth, or you may be running them too fast, which may account for the burning, or the saws may be so mounted that they have a tendency to wedge themselves in the cut. Set the teeth coarser, and run slower, and let us hear the result. You will find a large amount of information on sharpening and working saws in “Saw-mills, their Arrangement and Management,” by M. Powis Bale, a copy of which can be had from this office.\n\nSaw Sharpening.—In reply to “A. J. & Co.,” I may say that, after long experience in saw sharpening, I find that circular and frame saws gulleted with an emery wheel and topped with a file do better work than if topped with an emery wheel. I have never sharpened band saws with machines, but have worked them such they have been thus sharpened. In all cases I have had to alter the saw to get it to work well, the set especially being far from good. I always set with a hammer and an anvil. A. J. & Co. should employ a practical man; a poor man at this work is dear at any price.—EXPERIENCE.",
