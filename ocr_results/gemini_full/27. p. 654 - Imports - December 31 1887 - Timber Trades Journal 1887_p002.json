CHARLES POWIS, engineer, has removed his offices to 1, Gracechurch Street, E.C.\n\nGT. YARMOUTH.—Mr. James Woolverton will sell, without reserve, a cargo of Riga timber and lathwood ex Sirene, at Messrs. Jewson’s yard, Southtown, on Monday, the 9th prox. The occasion of the sale is a dispute about the goods.\n\nWISBECH.—It is stated that the local timber merchants both here and at Sutton Bridge have advanced their prices for most classes of timber in view of possible political complications of a warlike character in which Russia may be involved.\n\nCANADA COMPANY.—At the meeting of this company, held on the 29th inst., a dividend was declared by the directors of £1 10s. per share for the half-year ending the 10th prox. The dividends paid for the two previous half-years were £2 per share each.\n\nTENDERS.—Mr. W. Wood obtained the tender for the supply of fagots at £1 per 100 at the last meeting of the Faversham Guardians of the Poor, whilst the Medway Guardians at their last meeting decided to give the contract for fagots to Mr. W. Howe, of Luton for fagots at 15s per 100.\n\nH. G. GOODDAY & Co., of Paris, have removed their offices to 25, Rue des Mathurins, where they are admirably situated for the convenience of their customers. This firm, established for nearly sixteen years, continues to represent some of the leading marks from Sweden and Russia. Mr. H. G. Goodday’s London address remains as before, 5, Great Winchester Street, E.C.\n\nA WOOD MERCHANT SUED.—At the last sitting of the Bromley Court, Mr. Cousins appeared on a judgment summons to show cause why he should not pay a small debt to a Mr. H. J. Lukey. Mr. Weller, who appeared for Mr. Lukey, said the debtor was a well-known wood merchant in the neighbourhood, and was well able to pay £1 16s. 8d., the amount they sought. After hearing the defendant on his means, his Honour made a fresh order for payment at the rate of 4s. a month.\n\nTHE PRICE OF UNDERWOOD.—A Kentish contemporary says this week:—\" The prices of underwood have fallen even lower this\n\n***\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nmonth than in 1886. One of the oldest auctioneers in East Kent informs us that the cants on one estate which were sold by him on the last occasion for £1,200 have only realised this year about £300. He states, however, that in the interval rabbits have been largely kept, and that the underwood has been deteriorated to a considerable extent in consequence.\n\nNEWCASTLE EXHIBITION AWARDS.—In the list of the successful exhibitors at this exhibition the following names occur: Robey & Co., Lincoln, gold medal for horizontal fixed engine, with Proell gear; Hunting & Co., Newcastle, silver medal for dovetailing machines; Hudswell, Clarke, & Co., silver medal for Rodger’s wrought iron pulleys; M.C. Duffy & Son, Storks Road, Bermondsey, silver medal for immovable “Acme” wood flooring; M. Glover & Co., Leeds, silver medal for patent steam-power wood-splitting machine. Honourable mention has also been accorded to Armstrong, Addison, & Co., Sunderland, for pitch pine gate, design, strength, &c.; T. Conyers Hardy & Co., Newcastle, for general exhibit; and Robert Thubron & Co., Newcastle for creosoted timber.\n\nACTION BY WOOD DEALERS.—At the last sitting of the County Court, at Faversham, Kent, his Honour Judge Selfe had the case of J. & H. Price, wood dealers, of Dunkirk, v. B. Howe, woodman, of the same place, before him. It appeared from the defendant’s statement that the plaintiff engaged him to cut wood, and agreed to pay the same as other people. He did not deny the money claimed was owing, but put in a counter-claim for work done. This amounted to a shilling more. Defendant added that plaintiff only paid 10s. an acre, whereas other people paid 12s. and 14s. Plaintiff denied that the defendant was engaged on those terms; he informed all his men, including the defendant, that he could not pay them as much as he had done last year, as every kind of labour had been reduced in price. He strongly denied that he said he would be guided by what other people paid, and added that it was singular that defendant should have gone on after he knew he would get no more than 10s. an acre. His Honour found for the plaintiff.\n\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nCOATES, J.

Henry died in the year 1859, and his share in the business was estimated at £2,000. He did not leave a will, and the division of his property was arranged between the family. Mr. Hugh Lewis states that each person entitled received \"satisfaction\" in one way or another. Messrs. Richard and Hugh Lewis, at the time of Henry's death, had also built sundry lots of houses, and, by the year 1865, the four brothers had joined together and have continued in partnership from that time to the date of the receiving order, and have traded as builders under the style or firm of Lewis Brothers. Mr. Hugh Lewis has had transactions outside of the firm on his own account and since the year 1876 he has also built and bought properties on joint account with Mr.",
