444 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.

the price obtained is by no means conclusive as to the value of the goods which the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. So that of all these charges nothing, it seems to me, ought to be allowed except the freight, which it is admitted should be allowed, and such actual out of pocket outgoings in respect of the sale which was made as upon inquiry may be thought to be proper.
There remain two questions; one is the question whether by way of damages any allowance in the nature of interest for keeping the plaintiffs out of possession of their goods all this time should be made. Prima facie, it seems to me that there should be some such allowance, not, of course, of interest, but damages should be given to the plaintiffs for the long time they have been kept out of the possession of these their own goods, and, of course, the ordinary measure of such damages would be to allow damages on the footing of 5 per cent. (this being a mercantile matter) upon the value from the time when the defendants wrongfully took possession of these goods. But then, of course, in estimating that, I must look to the delay that has taken place, and who is to blame for that delay. I regret exceedingly to see that the writ in this action was issued so long ago as the 19th of October, 1881. I asked, the moment I saw that, whether the blame for the delay could be thrown on the Court, but that was answered by the handing up to me of the list of non-witness causes (this being a non-witness cause) which preceded the Long Vacation, and it was not in the list. It was not the delay of the Court of Chancery. It has only come into the list of non-witness causes since the Long Vacation, and as only two months have elapsed since the Long Vacation, it cannot be that the delay is on the part of the Court. To whom is the delay attributable? Now I find the facts are these: The writ was issued on the 19th October, 1881. In the month of November) the 17th, I think) certain undertakings were given on both sides on the motion for injunction. In January, 1882, the statement of claim was delivered, and up to that time there does not seem to have been delay, nor indeed in the next step, for on the 30th January, 1882, the defence was put in. On the 24th of February an order was made that the plaintiffs should produce to the defendants documents—the usual order for the production of documents. On the 3rd of March there came an order for sale, which I mentioned, and on the 5th of April the reply was put in. It was not until the 20th June, 1882, that the plaintiffs filed their affidavit of documents.
That was a delay from February 24th until June of that year. Then the sale of the goods was completed about January or February of the following year, and it was not until the 6th February, 1883, that the defendants put in their rejoinder. That was a delay from April, 1882, to February, 1883, excused as to the documents, if that be an excuse, only since the month of June, 1882. From June to February they had the documents, and did not put in their rejoinder. Then comes an extraordinary delay. Notice of trial was not given until the 8th of November, 1883.
That must have been the fault of the plaintiffs. I cannot conceive why there was all the delay from February to November in giving notice of trial. The affidavits of the plaintiffs were not filed till November, 1884. That is a year later again. And for the delay between February, 1883, and November, 1884, I cannot see that anybody is to blame except the plaintiffs themselves.
The affidavits of the defendants are filed in February, 1885, and the plaintiffs', in reply, in April, 1885, and a new notice of trial is given on the 30th May, 1885.
I cannot help seeing there has been a very considerable delay on both sides, certainly a delay for which the defendants are to blame as much as the plaintiffs are to blame. Accordingly it is a matter that must be taken into consideration by the Court in estimating the damages. If there were no delay attributable to the plaintiffs, I should think it right to give them damages computed on the footing of 5 per cent. on the value from the time the goods were improperly taken possession of by the defendants, but seeing there has been this delay on both sides, I shall give damages only at half the amount computed at the rate of 2½ per cent. ; that, as nearly as I can judge, will be what is just between the parties.
Then there remains the question of the costs of this action. It is said the action mainly asks that the defendant may be ordered to accept the bill of exchange. It is impossible for me to make a man accept a bill of exchange, especially when he has always said from the first that he would not accept it. To imply a contract to accept a bill of exchange from the wrongful taking possession of the goods when the defendants have all along said, come what might, they would not accept the bill of exchange, seems to me to be out of the question entirely. But then I see that that claim has added one farthing to the costs of the action. The evidence and the pleadings must have been entirely the same whether that claim had been answered or not, and that evidence has not been very long evidence—evidence which I should have thought the parties might have put in in a month or two without the least difficulty, and evidence which is altogether to the main and important question in this action, whether there was a wrongful taking possession of these goods or not, and the question what damages ought to be paid for the wrongful taking possession. Accordingly, as I think, the defendants have been in the wrong from the first, it seems that I cannot make any order about the costs of this action, but that they must pay the costs. I think that the doubt that was raised about the freight makes any difference in that although the question between these being very small, I should have thought it might have been determined in a much simpler way without the delay that has taken place.
Mr. Hastings: Your lordship has said 2½ per cent. on the value. That is the value at the time of the conversion?
Mr. Justice Kay: Yes, there must be an inquiry as to what was the value at the time you took possession of these goods, and upon that, by way of damages, 2½ per cent. must be computed from the time—by way of half measure of damages; and then, according to my judgment, the plaintiffs will be entitled to recover that value to which the 2½ per cent. is added, and minus any proper expenses of the freight, the actual sale that took place. I mean out of pocket expenses, as to which, unless you can agree to them, there will be an inquiry. I have no doubt that you will be probably be able to settle the matter between yourselves.
Mr. Pearson: Your lordship has directed an inquiry with reference to the sale.
Mr. Justice Kay: Oh, no!
Mr. Pearson: The money in Court will be repaid?
Mr. Justice Kay: That is so, because you will receive that in part payment of what is due to you.
Mr. Pearson: The out of pocket expenses of the actual sale will be paid out of the fund in Court, not at the time of conversion.
Mr. Justice Kay: That I admit; but, the sale having taken place, I do not think they should be charged with those out of pocket expenses.
Mr. Pearson: If your Lordship pleases, the counter-claim, of course, will be dismissed with costs?
Mr. Justice Kay: What is the counter-claim? I have not heard a word about that.
Mr. Hastings: It was merely formal, in order to give effect to the lien.

CEDERBERG v. BORRIES, CRAIG, & CO.
We are compelled by great pressure on our space to hold over till next week our full report of this peculiar and important case, which was heard before Mr. Justice Groves and a special jury in the Court of Queen's Bench on Wednesday and Thursday.
The case briefly appears to have turned on the word "all," in the following clause of the contract—"Payment for the above goods by acceptance of sellers' or agents' approved drafts, payable in London at four months' from date of bill of lading, and if any advance be given, same to be paid by buyers' acceptance at one month from the date of lading, on receipt of, and in exchange for, all the shipping documents."
There were in this case five bills of lading signed by the captain, of which only one (and a second one), was handed to the buyers. Whereupon the defendants declined to pay for the cargo until they received the five parts of the bill of lading.
His Lordship, in summing up, said it was a melancholy case, and should not have been brought into Court at all, and the jury, without any deliberation, found for the plaintiff.

PROPOSED NEW DOCK AT SOUTHAMPTON.—The Corporation of Southampton on Tuesday, after many months' consideration, adopted a proposal to apply to Parliament for powers to construct a deep-water dock at a cost of over £200,000 exclusive of the land.
