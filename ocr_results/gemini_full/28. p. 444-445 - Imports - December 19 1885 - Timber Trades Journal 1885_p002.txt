FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published (in these lists) have security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
FRANCIS ROWE, builder and contractor, Taylor Square, Tavistock.—The sitting for the public examination of this bankrupt was held at the Stonehouse Bankruptcy Court last week. In reply to the Official Receiver, the bankrupt stated that his unsecured liabilities were £914 19s. 5d., and his assets were estimated to realise £40, book debts £17, household furniture £20, surplus from securities in the hands of creditors, viz.—value of securities £580, amount of debt £570, surplus £10, total £87, leaving a deficiency of £827 19s. 5d., which he attributed to losses upon contracts which he had had in business for eight years, from 1881. He had been in business since 1883 commencing without any capital. Since then he had had transactions with Mr. William Squires, of Tavistock. In that year he built the Tavistock Hotel for Mr. Squires, who advanced him money. He paid 1s. interest for every pound he drew, and 5 per cent. afterwards. At that time he had the money. The registrar pointed out that that was 40 per cent. per annum. Continuing, bankrupt said he had assigned to Squires two houses, for which £475 was allowed. For this property he (the debtor) had previously refused £500. Other properties had also been doubtfully dealt with Mr. Squires. He told his creditors how he stood with Mr. Squires. He knew he was insolvent when he paid Mr. Squires, and also when he incurred several bad debts. Had recently executed a bill of sale to Mr. Langman on his furniture and stock for £75, which money was borrowed to pay a pressing creditor to enable him to go on with. On the application of the Official Receiver, the bankrupt was ordered to furnish a goods and cash account from the 1st January, 1883, and adjourned the examination for a month.
