[DECEMBER 26, 1885.\n\nwere signed; and this was specially put in to make this an exception to that custom, so that the buyers should receive all the bills of lading in this case.\nOne of the defendants, Mr. James Craig, was next called, and stated that since 1882 they had decided if shippers would not trust them to the extent of making the cargo deliverable to their order, in such case they should require every part of the set of bills of lading made to the shipper's order, before payment.\nHe admitted it was most unusual to issue bills of lading in sets of five.\nHe never heard of Cederberg & Co. before this instance.\nThey had bought Edgerton & Hubbard's Wyborg shipments.\nTheir last set of bills of lading consisted of three, and were handed to them under terms of contract; but in cross-examination he admitted having paid for this cargo on receipt of two of the set, upon an undertaking that the third would be forthcoming.\nMr. John Dixon, the defendants' manager, was next called, and positively denied having agreed with Mr. Welch to pay for the goods after arrival; stating that his instructions were \"no payment unless we got the entire sets of bills of lading.\"\nFor the defendants counsel argued that as the plaintiffs had entered into a contract to supply all the shipping documents, and that as five bills of lading were signed by the captain, his clients were legally entitled to the full set of five before he could be made to pay for the goods in question.\nFor the plaintiffs it was contended that the custom was, as proved by the witnesses, to give the buyer one bill of lading only, irrespective of the number signed, and that, therefore, one bill was sufficient under this contract; besides, when one bill of lading was accomplished the others were void.\nThe main point was that the defendants had actually taken delivery of these goods.\nMr. Craig had admitted throughout that he had a good title to the goods, and yet he maintained that he was entitled to all the parts of the bill of lading—an impossible position, counsel contended.\nHis Lordship, in summing up, said this was a very melancholy case, and should never have been brought into Court at all.\nHe thought if Mr. Craig did not pay for this cargo and protest at the time that he would not again pay before getting the entire set of bills of lading.\nRather than that, Mr. Craig seems to have decided that he would have the matter decided by law.\nReferring to the word \"all\" in the contract, his Lordship said that the term \"shipping documents\" was one of a mercantile character, that a lawyer could not tell what the words would mean.\nWhen a contract refers to shipping documents, what does it mean?\nDoes it include all the documents, or all the customary documents?\nIt is said by the plaintiffs that the shipping documents, according to the custom at Wyborg, do not include more than one bill of lading.\nThe defendants do not deny this.\nNow what is the effect of the word all?\nDoes it mean every document connected with the ship?\nDoes it mean receipts for each particular portion of the cargo, or what?\nIt cannot mean every written piece of paper that has something to do with this ship on this particular voyage.\nIt must mean all shipping documents that have a definite character.\nThis, whether you put \"all\" in or leave it out, it would be the same thing.\nI should presume that if the word \"all\" were omitted, still the person is bound to deliver all those documents which are properly called shipping documents.\nIt is for the jury to decide whether the word \"all\" affects the case or not.\nI should think not.\nThe jury, without any deliberation, found for the plaintiffs.\nMr. Pollard wished to have specific findings left to the jury, but his Lordship declined to do so.\nA verdict and judgment was then entered for the plaintiffs for the amount claimed, and a certificate granted for a special jury.\nMr. Pollard asked for a stay of execution pending an appeal, offering to pay the money into Court.\nMr. Justice Grove: No, I do not wish to assist the defendants in any further litigation; if the law gives you any rights, you may exercise them.\nSEIZURE OF HOP-POLES.—By the direction of the Rev. J. L. Cameron, a number of hop-poles were seized and sold under a distress warrant, last week, for the recovery of extraordinary tithes at Mr. A. May's farm, Timberman, Shoreham.\nAfter the sale an indignation meeting, called by placard headed \"The Church in Danger,\" was held, and, amid great excitement, a resolution for the abolition of tithes was carried.\nA large number of farmers were present.\nAn Atlantic liner, of 5,500 tons, intended for the North German Lloyd's Company, to run between New York and Bremen, has been successfully launched from Messrs. Elder's yard, Glasgow.\n\nFIRE BRICKS — GLAZED\nGOODMAN & CO.,\nSole Agents in London for E. BOWEN, STOURBRIDGE (Fire Bricks, &c.) Wm.
