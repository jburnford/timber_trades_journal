CHICAGO.
(From the “North-western Lumberman,” January 11th.)
Little can be said concerning the outlook for the pine lumber business in this city at present. The members of the trade seem to have no definite opinion in regard to it, and about all that can be gathered is that the business of the coming season depends to a large extent upon contingencies which may or may not arise. If anything—as, for instance, a foreign war—should arise to stimulate general business the lumber trade would feel its influence as soon as any other industry; but, on the other hand, the heavy crop of logs that will doubtless be gathered on the principal lumbering streams of the north-west is as likely to depress the trade even beyond the point it reached last year by producing an excessive over-supply.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the “Lumberman’s Gazette,” December 20th.)
Nothing new has transpired during the past week to change the aspect of lumber affairs in the Valley from previous conditions. Most of our operators are quite confident that most of the stock on dock will be disposed of by early spring, and the only question with those who have full holdings is whether or no they can get their docks cleared in time to begin sawing when the season for starting the mills begins. A fairly successful week’s work in logging has been done, and indications still favour a heavy yield upon all the streams tributary to the Valley. The skidding quota is unusually large, while the amount banked is much in advance of one year ago. The cry is still for snow, though sleighing is moderately good on all the old trips, though the new roads are very unsatisfactory, but the elements now look favorable to a generous yield of snow.
QUEBEC.
(From the “Quebec Chronicle,” January 4th.)
The close of another year involves the pleasure of writing our customary review of transactions in the shipping trade of the port.
On the opening of navigation the hopes of an increased volume of business during the season proved well founded, although the character of the market at the commencement was quiet, a marked improvement having taken place later, and continuing until the close, indicating brighter prospects for next year.
The attempts to divert the deal trade (which is yearly assuming greater proportions) from this port, its natural outlet, have been made on a larger scale than usual, aided by the sole chance that would assist them to make the charges as low as viâ the St. Lawrence, namely, low freights and extraordinary facilities afforded by the competing lines from the West to the Atlantic seaboard, which to any one conversant with the movements of the different roads, and the precarious nature of their rates, will not amount to much, as there is slight chance of shipments becoming a permanent business. Further, the excessive dullness in the Western lumber markets, and heavy stocks on hand, forced an outlet, which in times of even moderate briskness would be
