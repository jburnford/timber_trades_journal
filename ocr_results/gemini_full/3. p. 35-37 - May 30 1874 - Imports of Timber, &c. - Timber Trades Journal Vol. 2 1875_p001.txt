FREE TIMBER.
WE have frequently had occasion of late to call attention to our diminishing home supply of timber; to the need of husbanding our forests; and to the great advantage of drawing on our natural reserves in Canada for our wood. The subject is one that has engaged the earnest attention of Congress, and has been the occasion of an elaborate report from a committee of the House of Representatives during the present session. The proposed reciprocity treaty between the United States and Canada (the details of which, we trust, will soon be made public) will, among other commercial benefits, give an impulse to certain branches of trade which could not be attained without "free timber." Whatever other good reasons exist that render us desirous of gaining the good-will of the four million Canadians, and promoting their and our own commercial interests by a treaty of mutual reciprocity, the single item of "free timber" is of importance enough to the United States to induce us to look with extreme favour upon the proposal of a free exchange of products with the Dominion.
What freedom of commerce really means is, unfortunately, little understood. Thus, for instance, it may be pointed out that, notwithstanding the duty on our importations of foreign timber, we have kept on increasing them, and that since the abrogation of the former reciprocity treaty, we have nearly trebled them. But this only proves that the giant refuses to be bound by any restraint; that the device of restriction may retard but cannot arrest his full growth. Under our present tariff system we have plenty of opportunities to observe how nature and nature's laws are hemmed in by the short-sightedness and selfish interests of a few men who can manipulate political power.
For instance, the people of our northern and eastern States constitute a community unequalled in the whole world for mechanical ingenuity; but among other deficiencies of raw material for us to exercise this ingenuity upon, there is the deficiency of timber. Just across our border live a hardy race who have less ingenuity and mechanical skill, but have an abundant of forests which yield the finest timber in the world. Now it is not practicable at present to produce the articles which we manufacture of wood, unless the ingenious population of our northern estates will go there to produce them; and as this would be substantially impracticable, the next best thing is for the timber to be brought from Canada to our ingenious workmen. It is a commercial case of the mountain not going to Mohammed, and the solution is of Mohammed going to the mountain. But at this point a few interested men intervene, and not only lay a money duty on Canadian timber, but put all kinds of restrictions on the free transportation of it, such as the measurements, valuations, seizures, conspiracies, moieties, "Jaynings," Sanborn contracts, and all other ills that custom-houses, is heir to. Now whom do we punish by this inquisition—the Canadians or ourselves? We commit "harikari" not on account of revenue, but to uphold a few scores of rapacious forest-timber owners among our fellow-citizens, who, besides picking the pockets of this generation, inflict great miseries on posterity by destroying prematurely the most glorious inheritance of our territorial possessions.
We have the most cordial hope that the negotiation for the treaty will be successful; and as we cannot at this moment discuss the merits of the Canadian proposition in its details, we point out generally that "free timber" alone is of importance enough for us to heartily desire an equitable commercial adjustment with the British Possessions.—New York Evening Post.
