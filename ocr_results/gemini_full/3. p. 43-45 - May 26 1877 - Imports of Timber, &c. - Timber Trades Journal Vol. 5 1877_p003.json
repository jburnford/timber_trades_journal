Forty thousand feet of the main portion of the Exhibition building have been secured for the exhibitors of the Dominion.\n\n45\n\nAmerican Intelligence.\n\nNEW YORK.\n(From the \"Real Estate Record,\" May 5th.)\nWe cannot find much change in the general status of the market for wholesale parcels. Few inquiries are developed of any magnitude, and buyers, as a rule, are inclined to work along on the hand-to-mouth policy, and confine their operations to positive and near-by wants. Luckily there is not much stock pressing for a sale from any quarter, and this admits of the retention of a fairly steady tone, with occasional opportunities arising where sellers can gain temporary fractional advantages on special selections. Suppliers are going on board to some extent in competition of foreign orders, and there is the usual shipment of odd lots \"to fill,\" but fresh inquiries on export account are not very liberal at the moment here, and there also appears to be a smaller number of sales making to go abroad direct from the mills. The latter feature, however, is claimed to be only a natural lull after pretty liberal amounts contracted for early last month. Reports of some sort of immense demand to come from Europe for ship timber were circulated this week, but none of our dealers appear to know anything of the matter. The class of stuff likely to be called for, however, is not, as a rule, handled to much of an extent at this port.\n\nTHE SAGINAW VALLEY.\n(From the \"Lumberman's Gazette,\" May 2nd.)\nAs we intimated in our last, a considerable animation began to manifest itself about the middle of last week, and before its close quite a goodly amount of stock had changed hands, though hardly as much as would be reasonably expected from the number of dealers on the market. Nine firms from Cleveland were represented here at one time, besides two or three from Chicago, and others from distributing points farther east and south. As a general rule they reported home sales fairly active for the spring trade, though at rather unsatisfactory prices. Distributors' stocks we find for the most part are badly broken up; still many of the parties on dock last week returned without buying as extensively as they had intended to when starting from home, principally from the fact that they had hoped to secure stocks at some thing of a concession from the prices ruling last fall, but manufacturers being firm, they concluded to content themselves with simply enough for immediate wants—hoping for a better outlook when the new cut begins to have its influence upon the market. The ruling price for the week has been 5.50 dols., 11 dols. and 28 dols. or 30 dols. While some lots have sold a little below this, and others a shade above, the great majority of the negotiations were at these figures. Producers being confident that they can dispose of their old stock on hand before the new is made available, are more firm in holding to their figures, perhaps, than they would otherwise be, thus maintaining a firmer tone in the market.\n\nCHICAGO.\n(From the \"North-western Lumberman,\" May 3rd.)\nThe demand for lumber, shingles, &c., at the cargo docks during the week has been about sufficient to carry off the supply from day to day without at any time developing a very remarkable degree of activity. The offerings have not been of a very desirable character, consisting chiefly of Manistee, White Lake, and Ludington dimension stuff, with an occasional cargo of ordinary mill run, and for this reason buyers have not been anxious to make purchases. The sales have been principally to country buyers, who, as a rule, come to the city with the intention of buying, and do not like to return until they have supplied themselves. Local operators seem disposed to wait until there is a better assortment to select from, and as there is an abundant stock of dry lumber in market, they can do so without much inconvenience.\n\nTHE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.\n(From the \"Lumberman and Manufacturer,\" May 3rd.)\nThe European war and its political and social results; the profit and loss of the wheat operators; the impending grasshopper crop; the long-continued dry weather—its results on the log and lumber trade; with a variety of these themes, have given a spice and variety to the dull monotony of the trade for the week which at best could hardly be called fair, and amused and worried the folks as much as the possession of a pet elephant would. The chief interest, of course, has settled down to a conviction centred in the question of the drives, upon which the bulk of the trade rains the bulk of the logs cut on the waters of the Mississippi river will remain where they are. It is idle to say that they will or will not be secured, but the prospect is not cheering to those whose capital is locked up in logs. Some dealers, in view of the probable suspension of the drives and good crops, are decidedly stiff at present rates, and strongly disposed to raise the price of leading grades; but so far no one is willing to inaugurate. Shipments are improving as compared with last week.",
