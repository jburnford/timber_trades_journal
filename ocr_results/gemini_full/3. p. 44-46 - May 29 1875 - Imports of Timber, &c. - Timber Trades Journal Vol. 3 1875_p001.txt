district; for although reports from Middlesborough and Stockton are rather more favourable at present, it is quite the reverse with us, rumours being afloat affecting the stability of some of our local firms, but we hope with the assistance of friends they may tide over the crisis.
We hear of a purchase by one of our local firms of 5,000 standards of deals, a large proportion of them being Gefle goods.
Coal freights outwards are pretty good, but the return freights with wood goods are low. Annexed, I hand you the current rates to coal ports:—Gefle, 35s.; Soderhamn, 36s. 3d.; Sundswall, 37s. 6d. to 38s.; Wyborg, 37s. 6d. to 38s.; Hudikswall, 37s. 6d.; Hernosand, 40s.; Riga sleepers, 13s. 6d.; Riga deals, 38s.; Quebec, 75s.; St. John's, 72s. 6d.

GLASGOW.
(From our own Correspondent.)
May 27th, 1875.
Our timber market here has been extremely quiet during last fortnight. Only three cargoes have arrived into Clyde, two of deals and one of East Indian teak; and notwithstanding the small import up to date compared to last year—which, by the way, is a remarkable feature of the wood trade here at present,—no buoyancy in prices among either dealers or consumers has yet become perceptible.
The old stocks are moving but slowly away; no public auction sales of deals have been held here since the 4th inst., which was anything but encouraging.
There can be doubt, however, as the community here is very large, and business generally carried on with much spirit, that fresh imports will soon be demanded and last year's stock come to a close with a rush, probably sooner than many anticipate. On the 18th inst. Messrs. Farnworth and Jardine exposed to auction the cargo of Minatitlan mahogany ex Ebenezer. Scarcely one-third of the wood was sold, which consisted chiefly of the largest dimensions. For the small sized wood there was little or no demand, although offered at an extremely low minimum rate. The average price realized for the portion sold was about 5½d. per foot.
There was a pretty good attendance, but few seemed inclined to purchase, although the cargo was by no means an inferior one. Messrs. Edmiston and Mitchell will offer on Tuesday next, 1st June, by public auction at Stobcross timber yard, the cargo of Mexican mahogany (Uspanapa river wood) just landed ex Frigga,—Samuel Lett, Esq., importer.
Current rates:—White pine, prime square broadwood, 17 inch, 2s. 1d. and 2s. 1½d.; deck plank, 60 to 70 feet, 1s. 10, to 2s.; F. A. Q., 50 to 70 feet, 19d. to 21½d.; ordinary, 40 to 60 feet, about 17½d.; red pine, 18d.; stock heavy oak, 2s. 3d. to 2s 6d.; birch (lower port), 14d. to 17d.; Dalhousie and Quebec, 17d. to 20d.

Timber trade here still remains inactive, and nothing new can be reported; the old stocks are being cleared off as speedily as possible, at prices far from remunerative.
The arrivals of wood goods this last fortnight have been fewer than the previous, and on comparing the present list with the one at the same date last year I find there were upwards of 40 cargoes various timber against 15 as presently reported, that is from the 12th to 25th of May.
The only sale announced for the next fourteen days is Messrs. W. Thomson & Co.'s, on the 1st current, consisting of Swedish timber and deals.
I cannot yet mention any increase for the demand of tonnage from the Baltic; vessels in the meantime are not wanted.

THE SAW-MILL, timber-yard, plant, and all requisites for carrying on the business of a timber merchant, belonging to the late Mr. W. Lovell, timber merchant, Malton, Yorkshire, were put up for auction on Wednesday last, and withdrawn, only one offer (£2,500) being made.
