446 THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. [JUNE 20, 1885.

Within a short distance of the Trent are the Erewash and Nottingham canals. It is thus evident that a very large and populous district can be brought by means of the River Trent into communication with these thriving seaports.

GLASGOW.
The first auction sale of Canadian deals of this season's import, took place here on 17th inst., and the catalogue comprised a large and varied assortment of goods. Although the opening sale, the interest apparently was not strong, a small company being met at the hour announced, but when all gathered in the saleroom, half an hour afterwards, it was fairly well filled. In the catalogue submitted there were about 100 lots Quebec deals, nearly all this season's wood; out of these 11 lots were sold at fair rates, the remainder withdrawn, bids not meeting brokers' views. The remainder of the catalogue, comprising the balance of a cargo of Californian redwood, and about 30 lots lower port deals, pine and spruce, was withdrawn, also a parcel of 27 logs Quebec birch, which was fine wood and of large square. The offer made for the first lot of birch put up, 20 logs, 19 1/4 in. average square, not coming up to what brokers wanted, the entire parcel, which was much the same size, was withdrawn. An extreme quietness in business is indicated by the whole day's transactions. As regards deals, it is well known that last year's stock of Quebec is nearly exhausted here, so that so far as this goes the new season's deals have an unusually good opening. The arrivals of Canadian deals since the import season began amount to 39,000 pieces, all coming per steamer. At this time last year there had been about 91,000 pieces imported.
The principal imports to note are two cargoes of pitch pine and a steamer cargo of Sundswall battens at Greenock, and at Glasgow two cargoes of deals and timber from Weymouth; also just arrived a cargo of Tabasco mahogany, per Bootle, from Tonala, which, we learn, will be brought to sale at Queen Dock on any early day.

LEITH.
The expected fleet of wood-laden vessels is long of appearing, the arrivals this week being still comparatively few, with no great weight of goods.
The trade is even quieter this week than last, and the quantity of wood going into consumption is small for the present time of the year, when with favourable weather all building operations ought to be prosecuted with vigour.
Notwithstanding the quiet times the public sales are not intermitted, and on Tuesday last Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co. offered, on account of the importers, Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, & Co., two cargoes of Sundswall red deals and battens, along with a steamer parcel of Riga white deals. All the goods were fresh arrived and landed in good order, but nevertheless the attendance of buyers was very limited, and those present showed very little disposition to bid. In consequence the sale finished early, and the quantity disposed of publicly was not large, although it seems it was supplemented somewhat by some private purchases at the close of the sale, particulars of which did not, of course, transpire. The principal prices obtained at the sale were as undernoted:—
Per lin. ft.

6 1/2 x 2 1/2 NON, NNO red battens 1 1/4d.
