WALTER SMITH.—In the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court on the 12th inst., a motion was made on behalf of Walter Edward Smith, solicitor, of the firm of Walton & Smith, Southport, to vary or reverse the decision of the trustee rejecting his proof against the estate of Walter Smith, contractor, Southport, a bankrupt, for the sum of £1,200 and upwards for bills of costs, on the grounds that particulars had not been furnished, that the amount was undetermined, that nothing was due, and that the costs were liable to taxation. The motion was supported by Mr. Little, instructed by Messrs. Walton & Smith, and was opposed, on behalf of Mr. Banner, the trustee, by Mr. Walton, instructed by Mr. Sephton. It appeared that various bills of costs had been rendered, amounting in all to the sum of £1,900, and there had been large payments on account. The applicant had also acted under a power of attorney on behalf of the bankrupt, and there was an account current between them. Prior to the entering of the motion, there had been negotiations for the reference of all matters in dispute to Mr. Bellringer, but the parties had been unable to agree upon the form of order. After considerable argument with regard to the proof, and as to whether the bills of costs were all liable to taxation, the Judge intimated that the matter

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
J. W. CARLISLE.—A motion by Mr. F. Shelby, the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt, a builder and contractor at Widnes, was made in the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court on Friday last, for an order declaring that certain effects on the bankrupt’s premises were the property of the trustee as against those of Messrs. Tyrer & Co. Mr. Walton (instructed by Mr. Dodd) appeared in support of the motion, and Mr. Pickford and Mr. Dodd appeared for the respondents (Mr. Bolland), who held mortgages which were alleged to cover the property in question. It appeared that in August, 1872, the bankrupt gave a sum of £500 from Mr. Gibson a mortgage to him of certain machinery which was machinery de novo “now on the land.” In January of the present year Messrs. Gibson & Bolland having advanced four years previously a sum of £760 to enable him to effect an arrangement with his creditors, the bankrupt gave them a second mortgage in similar terms, which was stated to cover the machinery “now” on the land. Mr. Walton admitted that the trustee could not claim any machinery which was on the premises of the bankrupt before the date of the mortgages, but he argued that machinery afterwards acquired did not come within the terms of the mortgage, and the trustee was entitled to possession of it. This was the principal point in the case, and other points were whether certain machinery which the trustee claimed did not come within the mortgage by virtue of it having been fixed to the freehold. In regard to the mortgage of Messrs. Gibson & Bolland, a further question was as to its validity, in view of it not having been registered. The hearing of the case occupied several hours, and upon its conclusion his Honour intimated that he could not give judgment until he had inspected the machinery in question, and an appointment was made for that purpose.
WILLIAM ALFRED MEADOWS.—In this matter an application was made in the Liverpool Bankruptcy Court on the 12th inst. on behalf of the executors of the late William Gradwell, of Barrow-in-Furness, for an order declaring that they were entitled to 6,510 gallons of creosote oil, now standing in certain tanks on the premises of bankrupt, at Rainhill. Mr. A. Walton, instructed by Mr. F. Taylor, of Barrow, appeared for the applicants, and Mr. Pickford, instructed by Messrs. W. H. Collins & Co., for the respondent (the trustee of the bankrupt), Mr. L. Voisey. According to the statement of the applicants, the oil in question was sold by the bankrupt to Mr. Gradwell some time before the bankruptcy, and was paid for but not delivered, the bankrupt holding it to his order and separating it from the bulk of the creosote on his premises. The argument, therefore, was that the applicants were entitled to possession of it as against the trustee who had seized it. Mr. Pickford, on the other hand, contended that, although the bankrupt before the sale of the creosote had not committed an act of bankruptcy, he was nevertheless insolvent, and Mr. Gradwell had knowledge of this from the fact that he had called a meeting of his creditors, and the delivery of the goods would have amounted practically to a fraudulent preference to Mr. Gradwell as and against the other creditors. Possession of the goods was claimed by the trustee.
generally. After hearing the arguments, his Honour said he would give judgment on a future day.
The public examination of Albert Edward Gilbert and Joseph Gilbert, builders, of Milford, took place at the Stafford Bankruptcy Court, before the registrar, on Monday. Mr. Morgan represented the trustee, and Mr. Hand the debtors. The joint statement of affairs showed liabilities to unsecured creditors £700, and assets estimated to produce £90. The separate liabilities of Albert Edward Gilbert were estimated to amount to £460, and assets £259 11s. 11d. The separate liabilities of Joseph Gilbert were estimated to amount to £114, and assets £8 10s., consisting of book debts. The examination was adjourned.
FRANK J. TAYLOR.—The first meeting of the creditors of Frank J. Taylor, of Halton, builder, was held on Tuesday afternoon. The liabilities are about £1,000. Receiver, Mr. C. J. Dibb, official receiver.
