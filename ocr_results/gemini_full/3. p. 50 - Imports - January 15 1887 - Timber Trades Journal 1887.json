The project, which is of a most colossal nature, is due to a civil engineer. It has just been laid before the Academy of Science. M. Eude proposes to cut a canal through Syria and Persia, and thereby unite the Mediterranean with the Persian Gulf. It would start from Antioch, opposite to the island of Cyprus. A portion of the Orontes would be canalised. The most difficult part to execute would be the cutting through the mountains leading to the Euphrates, which would also be canalised as far as Hit. From that town to Bagdad an artificial canal would enable ships to reach the Tigris, and the Tigris and Chat-el-Arab would be deepened up to the Persian Gulf. The project, it is estimated, would result in numerous and important advantages. It would shorten the route from Europe to Asia by three days. It would interest the English as regards India, and the French as regards their colonies in the far East. The Paris, commenting on the project, fears that England would object to it unless she had the command of it. Her jealousy would not allow France to monopolise it. However, \"generous France, in the interest of progress and humanity, would probably cede the brilliant idea to England, if she would only consent to carry it out.\"\n\nJANUARY 15, 1887.]\nEVERY description of\nMILLBANK SAW-MILLS, LONDON, S.W.\nWHITFIELD, ST., W.\nSTORE, ST., W.C.\nTelephone No. 3152.\nB.\nTELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS.\n158, Leadenhall\nof TEAK\nMAHOGANY AND\nAre always\nBIRCH, AM\nspecifications\nTELEPHONE H\nMAHOGANY AND HARDWOOD TRADES.\nMAHOGANY.—During the past week there have been two public auction sales of mahogany. On Tuesday, when part of the cargo of the steamship Oakdale, from Tabasco, was offered, there was not nearly so good an attendance of buyers as might have been expected, and the prices obtained seem to indicate that which would lead one to suppose that for this wood there is not now so much in demand as was the case some little time ago. Wednesday, however, when the first portion of Honduras wood just landed from the Becker, from Belize, was brought forward, were certainly better favoured, there being a very fair attendance and some fairly spirited competition, a good clearance being obtained. Evidently wood ranging from 16 to 22 in. is that which is most sought after just now though all sizes. The deliveries of mahogany are going on steadily, but this week have been, of course, in terfered with by the holidays, with land carriage. The remainder of the cargo ex Brodrene is all landed, and we have to report rather more favourably of it. The logs at the bottom of the cargo have improved the average of the whole, and the quality is very fair. The cargo contains a fair proportion of figury logs. There is only one arrival this week, viz., the [?] from Truxillo and Belize; the first part of the cargo is, we believe, from Truxillo, of a strict, a description usually of very straight growth, and of which there is not much landed. We attempt any discription of the portion sent. Another steamer is due from Belize, is, we believe, daily expected, but beyond this we know of nothing at hand. Though the trade has been quiet, of as particularly brisk a character, there is a fair amount doing, and",
