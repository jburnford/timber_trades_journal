W. Beattie, who offered a variety of White Sea and Baltic deals and battens.\nThe company was rather slow in mustering, and although, eventually, there was a fair representation of the trade, the competition was at no time brisk, and the demand easily satisfied.\nThe better class goods were firmly held, and for what was sold fair prices were got, but a number of buyers were aiming at rates which the exposer was not prepared to accept, and consequently the actual quantity disposed of was only moderate.\nThe following are the principal prices obtained:—\n11x3 redwood deals 3d. per lin. ft.\n11x3 whitewood ,, 2 1/2d. to 2 3/4d. ,,\n9x3 ,, ,, 1 3/4d. ,, 1 7/8d. ,,\n7x3 redwood ,, 1 1/2d. ,,\n6 1/2x2 1/2 ,, battens 1 1/4d. ,,\n6 1/2x2 1/2 whitewood ,, 1 1/8d. ,,\n8x3 ,, deals 1d. ,, 1 1/8d. ,,\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economizing space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
