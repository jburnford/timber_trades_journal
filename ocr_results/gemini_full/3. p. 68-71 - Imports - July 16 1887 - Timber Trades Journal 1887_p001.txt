LEITH.
The list of arrivals this week is a short one, and includes only two cargoes of deals and battens, one from Hudikswall and the other from Cronstadt.
Neither of the Quebec cargoes has as yet arrived, but one of them is said to have passed through the Pentland Firth on Monday, and, if this report is correct, she must be close at hand now.
There is nothing new to report in the state of trade this week; a quiet business is being done from the docks and yards, but buyers are careful only to purchase for actual requirements.
The effect of this is seen chiefly at the public sales, which are not so well attended as formerly in many cases, and at which the quantity of goods disposed of is decreasing.
The public sale this week was held at the Queen's Dock on 12th inst. by Mr. D. W. Beattie, who offered a variety of White Sea and Baltic deals and battens.
The company was rather slow in mustering, and although, eventually, there was a fair representation of the trade, the competition was at no time brisk, and the demand easily satisfied.
The better class goods were firmly held, and for what was sold fair prices were got, but a number of buyers were aiming at rates which the exposer was not prepared to accept, and consequently the actual quantity disposed of was only moderate.
The following are the principal prices obtained:—
11x3 redwood deals 3d. per lin. ft.
11x3 whitewood ,, 2 1/2d. to 2 3/4d. ,,
9x3 ,, ,, 1 3/4d. ,, 1 7/8d. ,,
7x3 redwood ,, 1 1/2d. ,,
6 1/2x2 1/2 ,, battens 1 1/4d. ,,
6 1/2x2 1/2 whitewood ,, 1 1/8d. ,,
8x3 ,, deals 1d. ,, 1 1/8d. ,,
