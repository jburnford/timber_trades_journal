INGRAM, C. E.—Mr. C. E. Ingram was further examined by the Official Receiver, before Mr. Registrar Langley, at the Town Hall, Cardiff, last week.
Mr. Handcock (Messrs. Downing & Handcock) appeared for the debtor.
The examination proceeded as follows:—You know, Mr. Ingram, that since your last examination Mr. Heard, who formerly was in partnership with you, has been examined?—Yes.
In his examination he stated that you were indebted to him to the extent of £5,000.—Yes, but certain policies were assigned to him in settlement of the matter.
When was that?—In December, 1885.
That was when you dissolved partnership?—Yes; all the matters were connected with the dissolution.
The policies were assigned in settlement of the old partnership account.
What claim can Mr. Heard, then, have upon you?—None, to my knowledge, because he has not even proved.
But he is put down as a creditor.—Not for that amount.
For £1,200?—Yes.
Let us know something more about the matter.—Well, I considered it settled, or I would have included the debt in my statement of affairs.
Were the policies assigned by some instrument in writing?—Yes, by deed of assignment.
And do you now distinctly state that, in con-

37

sideration of the policies assigned by you, he released you from the debt?—Yes.
The Registrar: Evidently he thought so, or the debt would have been shown in the statement.
Was this assignment of policies absolute, or by way of mortgage?—Absolutely.
Mr. Heard has not proved for the amount.
The examination was further deferred for a week.

SHORT, SHORT, & CO.—The debtors, who were timber merchants carrying on business in Victoria Street, and at Birmingham, also trading as newspaper proprietors in Fleet Street, recently petitioned the Court of Bankruptcy.
They have now filed a statement of affairs, which discloses liabilities amounting to £93,429, of which £63,461 are unsecured, with assets £20,776.
From the observations of the Chief Official Receiver it appears that the business of Short, Short, & Co., consisting chiefly of the export and sale of soft goods, was established about 1844 by the late Mr. Thomas Short.
The debtor George Short (brother of Mr. Thomas Short) states that he joined in partnership in 1868; in 1873 R. H. Short (son of Mr. Thomas Short) was admitted as a partner, and in 1875 Mr. Thomas Short retired in favour of his son, allowing his capital to remain in the business, which was continued by the debtors, G. and R. H. Short.
In 1876 the firm purchased the British Mercantile Gazette, of which they are still proprietors, and that paper became interested in two other weekly journals.
In 1882 Mr. Thomas Short died, and in July, 1883, W. R. Deykin became a partner with them.
They attribute their failure chiefly to heavy losses by bad debts, including a sum of £25,276 lost in Batavia in 1880-2, through the indiscretion, as they allege, of their agent in that country.
In addition, they state that about £9,000 has been lost in connection with the two weekly journals referred to.
The Chief Official Receiver states that the books have been well kept, and show that on June 30, 1880, there was an apparent surplus in the business of £16,314.
On behalf of the debtors a scheme was submitted at a subsequent meeting on Wednesday last, by which the property became vested in a trustee (Mr. A. O. Miles) for administration under the supervision of a committee of inspection.
It was also provided that the executors under the will of Mr. Thomas Short should stand aside until all the other creditors had received 5s. in the pound; the executors then received 4s. 6d. in the pound, and any further property to be divided ratably among all the creditors.
The scheme was unanimously agreed to, it being conceded that it was calculated to benefit the creditors.

YOUNG, GEORGE.—The first meeting of the creditors of George Young, timber dealer, of Gillingham, was held at the Official Receiver's office, Salisbury, on Friday week.
In answer to the official list of questions, the debtor stated he had carried on business at Gillingham as a timber merchant.
He commenced business at Christmas with a capital of about £100.
He had never been in partnership with any one.
He had kept both a day book and invoice book, which were in his possession.
He had no securities, and had nothing and no one an his life insured.
He had no stock.
He owed about £1 10s. for rent.
He was about the amount of his debts.
The meeting was adjourned owing to the state of the debtor.

The number of failures in the building trade during the past week was 9, against 8 in the corresponding week of last year.
The total number of failures was 81, against 87, showing a decrease of 6, being a net decrease, to date, of 22.
