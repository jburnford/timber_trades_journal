pally used in the construction of the buildings; that from Sweden being utilized more especially for the manufacture of windows and doors, &c., and floorings only to a limited extent.
Owing to the policy of the English Government, and the non-payment of the indemnities, there is no confidence whatever in the country, and consequently business is very bad in all branches of trade.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors listed in bankruptcy hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
WILLIAM KELSEY NASH.—The debtor traded as Nash & Co., builders’ merchants and manufacturers, 50, High Street, Wandsworth. A meeting of creditors was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, 109, Victoria Street, Westminster, on the 12th inst. The debtor’s statement of affairs showed total liabilities £2,649 11s. 3d., of which £1,168 6s. 8d. is due to unsecured creditors. The assets amount only to £63 6s. 6d. It appeared the debtor became aware of his insolvency in the year 1878, and in 1879 he executed a marriage settlement by virtue of which all his wife’s property was settled upon herself, and she takes the whole benefit under the deed. It appears that the debtor filed his petition for liquidation in 1883, and 2s. 6d. in the pound was accepted, but he has been unable to pay the whole of the same. He attributed his failure to speculative building, and accounts for his deficiency by the same cause, bad debts, having to pay part of his composition, &c. A quorum of creditors not being present no resolution was passed. An order for summary administration had been made of the debtor’s estate, and he has been adjudicated a bankrupt, being unable to make an offer to his Creditors.
