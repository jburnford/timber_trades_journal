NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," January 27th.)
Our market, in a wholesale way, is without any particularly encouraging character. If anything in the way of fresh arrivals happens to work through coastwise, and the quality is good, buyers can occasionally be found who will make a few cautious bids; and on the accumulated stocks here there is now and then a small draft made. Activity, however, is not mentioned in the reports of dealers, and no one is pretty steady, especially for good fair assortments of standard descriptions, as every week tends to diminish an accumulation which was small to commence with, and would not now stand a very heavy call. Dealers, however, are not by any means anxious to make contracts for future delivery, and one or two recent attempts to induce them to make bids were coldly received. The business prospect is as yet too uncertain to admit of any close calculation upon probable wants, and certainly from the present outlook nothing indicates a scarcity of lumber the coming season.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," January 25th.)
The week just closing has witnessed a slight improvement in the lumber trade of this city, and we are pleased to chronicle the fact that our market this morning is a shade more active than it has been for several weeks. The amount sold during the period under review, as compared with that disposed of in previous weeks, shows a perceptible increase, and the feeling among the dealers is also a little better, though the trade is still inactive and slow. A brisk and steady demand, however, cannot be expected this month, and the operators are therefore the more ready to accept any small increase in the number and amount of their sales without grumbling because it is not greater. Aside from this nothing has occurred to alter the condition of our market, which remains as previously described.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," January 24th.)
The past week has been an unexceptionably good one for work in nearly every lumber section of the North-west, as well as in Pennsylvania, New England, and Canada. The weather has been clear and sufficiently cold to keep operators on the "taps," and to maintain roads in a good slipping condition, so that the only drawbacks experienced are in the few cases where snow is too deep for convenience in the woods, or too mealy to pack well upon the log ways. Still it is seldom that better logging is found, on the whole, than now. Here in the Valley the very most is being made of it, and logs are being banked in large numbers. There is no doubt but that the supply now at the streams and on the skids is considerably in advance of that one year ago, and there is a general fear among manufacturers that more will be gotten out than can be disposed of next season, for though the number of little jobbers is smaller than usual, all the large operators are going in for enough more to make up for any falling off from this source. Still there is one peculiarity in lumbering this season, which is very general in all portions of the State,—operations in a large number of cases are being carried on near the very head waters of the streams, thus greatly enhancing the probabilities for having more logs hung up than usual, or greatly delayed in finding their way to the mills, so that those who have strong fears of an over-stock, generally have a corresponding hope that enough will be kept back to prevent any unusual surplus accumulating on the market.

ST. LOUIS.
The secretary of the St. Louis Lumbermen's Association has forwarded us statistics of the lumber trade of that city for 1876. The stock of lumber, of all kinds on band January 1st, 1877, was 138,168,000 feet, as compared with 121,270,671 on the first day of last year. He adds that there are in St. Louis thirty-eight lumber yards (four of them dealing exclusively in hardwood), eight planing mills, and three saw-mills.

ST. JOHN, N.B.
(From the St. John, N.B., "Daily Telegraph," January 10th.)
During the year just closed our timber and deal shipments to Europe have been larger than in any previous one except 1873 and 1874. The accompanying statements show a large increase over last year, both from St. John and Miramichi. It is a somewhat remarkable fact, not-
