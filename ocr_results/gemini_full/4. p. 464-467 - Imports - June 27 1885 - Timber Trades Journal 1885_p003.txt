GEORGE BROWN,
Exeter, builder.—At the Exeter Bankruptcy Court, held at the Castle of Exeter, on the 19th inst., the debtor filed his statement of affairs, which showed liabilities £1,047 18s. 1d., and assets £128 11s. 6d. The Official Receiver, in his observations, stated that the debtor commenced business in Exeter about seven years since without any capital. For the first two years he had a capital of £300, which he borrowed. In March, 1882, the debtor owed £700, and he then borrowed a further sum of £75, and gave a bill of sale on his stock and effects for securing the advancing of the £75 and the £700 previously advanced. The debtor gave a second bill of sale in November, 1884, on his stock, furniture, and effects, to secure a sum of £200, which sum was advanced to him to pay off pressing creditors. About two and a half years ago the debtor was perfectly solvent. Since March, 1882, he had kept no books of account whatever. Mr. Brown was examined by Mr. W. H. Tarbet, for the trustee, and said he had had very heavy losses on contracts, and drawing from the business for his own private use. He thereby constituted himself insolvent. The examination was closed. Mr. Brown applied for his discharge, which was suspended for this accommodation.
