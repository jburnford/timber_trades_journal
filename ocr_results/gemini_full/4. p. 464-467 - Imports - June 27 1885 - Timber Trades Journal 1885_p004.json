SANFORD.—The creditors of\nGeorge Small Sanford, of 110, Sidwell Street,\nExeter, builder, met on Friday last at the\nCastle of Exeter. According to the debtor's\nstatement his liabilities are £1,567, and the\nassets £128. The Official Receiver reported\nthat the debtor commenced business about ten\nyears since as a builder and contractor, with a\ncapital of £30. On the 8th of November, 1881,\nthe debtor owed Mr. James Brown, of Queen\nStreet, £75, and in consideration of the creditor\nadvancing him a further sum of £275 the\ndebtor gave him as security a bill of sale on\nhis stock, furniture, and book debts of £500,\nwhich sum was to be paid off by instalments in\ntwo and a half years. It did not appear that\nthe debtor paid any of the instalments, but in\nMarch, 1882, he commenced handing over to\nMr. Brown very nearly the whole of his takings,\nthereby constituting him a kind of banker.\nMr. Brown appears to have charged the debtor\nfor this accommodation about £275. The\nGOODMAN & CO.,\nCUMBERLAND WHARF,\nBETHNAL GREEN, E.\nFIRE BRICKS, GLAZED BRICKS, BLUE BRICKS.\nMERCHANTS ALSO IN\nFIRE BRICKS, SLATES, ROOFING TILES, PAVING TILES, KITCHEN SINKS, CHIMNEY POT, &c.\nDEVONSHIRE STREET STATION, G.E.R. ; and at OLD FORD DEPOT, L. and N.W.R.\nA LARGE STOCK KEPT. DELIVERIES BY VANS, OR \"ALONGSIDE\" IN THAMES.\n\n467\ndebtor had brought himself within sub-section\n3 of the 28th section of the Bankruptcy Act by\nomitting to keep a cash book. At their first\nmeeting the creditors agreed to accept a com-\nposition of 7s. 6d. in the pound, but as the\nnecessary security was not forthcoming the\nresolution was rescinded, and an offer\nof 5s. in the pound, payable in two equal in-\nstalments, was offered and agreed to, and the\napproved security duly tendered. At the date\nof the meeting thirty-two creditors had proved\nfor £1,107, and eighteen represented\n£842, being a majority in number, and exceed-\ning three-fourths in value. These unani-\nmously assented to the composition. The sum\nfor costs could not be much less than £425,\nand he (Mr. Andrew) did not consider that so\nmuch money, unless altogether unexpected,\ncould be got out of the estate. He was, there-\nfore, of opinion that, so far as the creditors\nwere concerned, it would be to their pecuniary\nadvantage if the resolu-\ntion were approved ; but the conduct of the\ndebtor would have to be considered. Mr. Cam-\npion and Mr. Ashford, appearing on behalf of\ncreditors, having expressed themselves willing\nto accept the arrangement, the Registrar ulti-\nmately made an order approving the acceptance\nof the composition.\nW. O. PEARCE.—An adjourned meeting for\npublic examination was held in this case last\nweek before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The bank-\nrupt, who traded as a timber merchant at 61,\nGracechurch Street, under the firm of W. O.\nPearce & Co., returned his liabilities at\n£3,096 19s. 5d., and assets £968 19s. 4d. In\nreply to the Official Solicitor, the bankrupt\nstated that at the first meeting he offered a\ncomposition of 7s. 6d. in the pound, but it was\nrefused, and an adjudication was made. A bill\nof exchange for £70 was given by him to his\nsolicitor in order to stop bankruptcy proceed-\nings at the suit of Mr. Green, of Bedford, but\nthey were not stopped, and the proceeds of the\nbill had since been handed to the Official\nReceiver. He had a private meeting of\ncreditors at the end of last year, and asked for\ntime ; he did not know how much he then\nowed, because his books had not been written\nup for the previous nine months. The books\nwere balanced at Christmas, 1883, at which\ntime he was able to pay all he owed if he had\nbeen paid what was owing to him. Since that\ntime he had paid about £500 to creditors ; he\nhad paid pressing creditors after he knew that he\nwas insolvent. He had contracted no debts\nin the course of last year, but most of the\ndebts were incurred in the course of last year.\nThe trustee, re-\nported by Mr. S. Ward, did not further\noppose, and his Honour ordered the examina-\ntion to be concluded.\nJ. BAKER.—A first meeting of creditors was\nheld before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver,\nlast week, under the failure of James Baker,\nof 4, Station Road, Kensal Green, and late of\nKingdon Road, West End, builder. The receiving order\nwas granted on\nMay 21st upon the joint petition of Mr. James\nCole, of Lewisham, and Mr. E. Delarogue, of\nStoke Newington, and the debtor furnished a\nstatement of affairs, showing unsecured debts\n£2,525 9s. 2d., liabilities fully secured £3,594 18s. 4d. And\nassets, surplus from securities, after deducting\npreferential claims, £585 3s. 10d.
