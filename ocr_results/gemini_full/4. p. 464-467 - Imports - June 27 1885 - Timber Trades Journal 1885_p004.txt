FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases
creditors whose names are published in these
lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for
the full amount.]
GEORGE S. SANFORD.—The creditors of
George Small Sanford, of 110, Sidwell Street,
Exeter, builder, met on Friday last at the
Castle of Exeter. According to the debtor's
statement his liabilities are £1,567, and the
assets £128. The Official Receiver reported
that the debtor commenced business about ten
years since as a builder and contractor, with a
capital of £30. On the 8th of November, 1881,
the debtor owed Mr. James Brown, of Queen
Street, £75, and in consideration of the creditor
advancing him a further sum of £275 the
debtor gave him as security a bill of sale on
his stock, furniture, and book debts of £500,
which sum was to be paid off by instalments in
two and a half years. It did not appear that
the debtor paid any of the instalments, but in
March, 1882, he commenced handing over to
Mr. Brown very nearly the whole of his takings,
thereby constituting him a kind of banker.
Mr. Brown appears to have charged the debtor
for this accommodation about £275. The

debtor had brought himself within sub-section
3 of the 28th section of the Bankruptcy Act by
omitting to keep a cash book. At their first
meeting the creditors agreed to accept a com-
position of 7s. 6d. in the pound, but as the
necessary security was not forthcoming the
resolution was rescinded, and an offer
of 5s. in the pound, payable in two equal in-
stalments, was offered and agreed to, and the
approved security duly tendered. At the date
of the meeting thirty-two creditors had proved
for £1,107, and eighteen represented
£842, being a majority in number, and exceed-
ing three-fourths in value. These unani-
mously assented to the composition. The sum
for costs could not be much less than £425,
and he (Mr. Andrew) did not consider that so
much money, unless altogether unexpected,
could be got out of the estate. He was, there-
fore, of opinion that, so far as the creditors
were concerned, it would be to their pecuniary
advantage if the resolu-
tion were approved ; but the conduct of the
debtor would have to be considered. Mr. Cam-
pion and Mr. Ashford, appearing on behalf of
creditors, having expressed themselves willing
to accept the arrangement, the Registrar ulti-
mately made an order approving the acceptance
of the composition.
W. O. PEARCE.—An adjourned meeting for
public examination was held in this case last
week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. The bank-
rupt, who traded as a timber merchant at 61,
Gracechurch Street, under the firm of W. O.
Pearce & Co., returned his liabilities at
£3,096 19s. 5d., and assets £968 19s. 4d. In
reply to the Official Solicitor, the bankrupt
stated that at the first meeting he offered a
composition of 7s. 6d. in the pound, but it was
refused, and an adjudication was made. A bill
of exchange for £70 was given by him to his
solicitor in order to stop bankruptcy proceed-
ings at the suit of Mr. Green, of Bedford, but
they were not stopped, and the proceeds of the
bill had since been handed to the Official
Receiver. He had a private meeting of
creditors at the end of last year, and asked for
time ; he did not know how much he then
owed, because his books had not been written
up for the previous nine months. The books
were balanced at Christmas, 1883, at which
time he was able to pay all he owed if he had
been paid what was owing to him. Since that
time he had paid about £500 to creditors ; he
had paid pressing creditors after he knew that he
was insolvent. He had contracted no debts
in the course of last year, but most of the
debts were incurred in the course of last year.
The trustee, re-
ported by Mr. S. Ward, did not further
oppose, and his Honour ordered the examina-
tion to be concluded.
J. BAKER.—A first meeting of creditors was
held before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver,
last week, under the failure of James Baker,
of 4, Station Road, Kensal Green, and late of
Kingdon Road, West End, builder. The receiving order
was granted on
May 21st upon the joint petition of Mr. James
Cole, of Lewisham, and Mr. E. Delarogue, of
Stoke Newington, and the debtor furnished a
statement of affairs, showing unsecured debts
£2,525 9s. 2d., liabilities fully secured £3,594 18s. 4d. And
assets, surplus from securities, after deducting
preferential claims, £585 3s. 10d. The following
