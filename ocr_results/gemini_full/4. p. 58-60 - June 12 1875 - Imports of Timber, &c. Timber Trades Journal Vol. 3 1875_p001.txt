WEST HARTLEPOOL.
(From our own Correspondent.)
June 9th, 1875.
Notwithstanding the advanced season of the year, orders are very scarce; and owing to the recent failures in the district, the uncertainty of being safe in your dealings is causing doubts and suspicions to arise as to the stability of some of the most respectable houses in the trade, and this being the case, all speculation is suspended, purchasers only buying for immediate wants. According to a previous announcement, a large sale of deals, battens, and boards took place on the 1st instant; the sale was well attended, and the goods upon the whole realized fair prices. Amidst a somewhat spirited competition, goods to the amount of between £4,000 and £5,000 exchanged hands.
The S. S. J. E. McConnell arrived here on the 3rd inst., with a cargo of sleepers, being the first steamer which has arrived this season with this class of goods.
Some few parcels of battens have come over by the steamers from Gothenburg, but they are for the most part going into yard.

The sales of wood in this market during last fortnight have not been very large, builders being chiefly engaged in finishing properties for the term, and the wood used for this purpose having been seasoned some time since.
Stocks are still large. It is understood, however, that the School Board here, have resolved on the erection of property to a very considerable extent, and that schedules are now preparing for the various tradesmen, which, together with the house building lately started at the west and north-east ends of the town may help to bring about an improvement in the timber market.
On the 26th ult. a cargo of yellow pine deals (Three Rivers) was sold at Port Dundas, Glasgow.
There was a fair attendance of buyers, but the sale on the whole was very quiet. Prices ranged from £8 5s. to £9 12s. 6d., for third quality.
On Tuesday, the 1st of June, a cargo of Mexican mahogany (Uspanapan wood) was offered by public auction at Stobcross Yard. Fully three-fourths of the cargo sold, including the small wood; rates ranging from 3½d. to 10½d., average about 5¾d.
And a considerable portion of the cedar at from 3½d. to 7d. The entire cargo amounted to 108,000 ft.
The market meantime is fully supplied with Mexican mahogany.
Current rates:—Quebec pine deals, per standard, first quality £20 to £22 10s.; second quality £11 10s. to £13 10s.; third quality £8 to £9 5s.
There have been no arrivals of pitch pine this month. Stocks are large and the consumption limited. The import from 1st January to date as compared with last year stands as under:—
Logs hewn. Logs sawn. Pcs. deals.
1874. 18,800 7,900 17,734
1875. 1,090 287 993
Hewn has sold at from 16½d. to 18d. per c. ft., 60 to 100 ft. average, sawn at 16½d. to 17d. per foot.

LEITH.

June 10th, 1875.
Timber trade remains extremely dull and the demand very limited.
There have been two sales of Swedish timber, deals, and battens, both of which were well attended, but, as usual, prices ruled low.
There is only one sale announced for the next fortnight,—battens and flooring.
The importations for the past fourteen days are twenty-nine, against thirty-five at same date in corresponding fortnight last season. One large cargo of sleepers has arrived at Granton from Riga, and a number of vessels are shortly expected to arrive at the various sleeper ports in the Frith.
Mr. W. Scott, contractor for the New Wet Dock, at present being constructed, died on Friday last, at his residence near Glasgow, aged sixty-five years.
Baltic Freights:—Wyborg, 38s. 6d.; Cronstadt, 35s. to 36s.; Riga 36s. to 40s.; Archangel, 65s.
