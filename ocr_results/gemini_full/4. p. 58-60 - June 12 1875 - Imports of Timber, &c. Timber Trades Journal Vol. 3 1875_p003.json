Cardiff: Tellefsen, Holst, and Wills.\nWe have received a copy of this useful trade circular, which is issued monthly to their friends and clients by Messrs. Tellefsen, Holst, and Wills, of Cardiff.\nThe May number now before us contains a com-plete list of the coal exports from Cardiff, Swansea, Newport, and Llanelly, during the month of April, to almost every known port in the globe; and as an indication of the enormous coal trade of Cardiff notwithstanding the strike of colliers, the export amounted to nearly 200,000 tons.\nA small paragraph is devoted to pitwood sleepers and mining timber, from which we quote as follows.—“We have to report very little change in the pitwood trade during the past month; the supply has more than equalled the demand, and the trade in all kinds of timber continues very dull.\nImporters, however, are anticipating an improved state of things now that the ironmasters’ men are gradu-ally resuming work, and it is hoped that a steady demand for pitwood will soon spring up.”\nThe above items with a variety of statistics and miscellanea make up a handy little circular, which must be very acceptable to the clients of this enterprising firm.\nCommercial Shorthand, by G. H. Wills. London: Elliot Stock, Pater-noster Row.\nThis is a useful little guide to the knowledge of shorthand, an art which in these days of commercial activity is becoming more and more popular.\nThe system appears to be based on several systems now in vogue, such as Taylor’s, Pitman’s, and others, with some novelties and improvements more especially suited to commercial purposes.\nIt is written in an easy progressive manner, and the different stenograms and phonograms are illustrated by plates.\nWe can cordially recommend this little work to all intending students of shorthand.\nLAUNCH.—A splendid sailing wooden barque, classed A 1 for eleven years, 300 tons register, was launched from the yard of Messrs. Alexander Hall & Co., Aberdeen, on the 5th inst.\nCHARLES HAMPTON & Co.—The business of pianoforte manufacturer, carried on by Mr. Charles Hampton, of 74, Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, London, has been transferred to this company with a capital of £100,000 in £10 shares.\nWORCESTER RAILWAY CARRIAGE AND WAGGON COMPANY (LIMITED).\n—A company is proposed to be incorporated under the above name for the purpose of purchasing the business and property of the West Central Waggon Company (Limited), at Shrub Hill, Worcester; the new company arising from the articles of association of the West Central Waggon Co. not containing the usual powers for raising capital or funds in the interests of the company.\nBELTING AND GEARING.—As regards the transmission of power, the Americans, says a French writer, aim at achieving two important things which are correlative—the lightest possible weight and the highest possible speed.\nHence the universal substitution of belting and gearing, and the general adoption of light shafting and small pul-leys, which are conspicuous features of their system of transmitting power.\nThe first move is usually a gear, but after that all transmis-sion is obtained by belting.\nThe belting is a little study in itself, but it will suffice to say here that belts of the latest improved pattern run for wonderful lengths of time without piecing.\nThe ease and dur-ability of the system would astonish the advocates of gearing.\nThe pulleys in general use are said to save 25 per cent. of the power.\nThe shafting is run twice as fast, and hence the pulleys can be smaller, yet the fly-wheel of a powerful engine may be large.\nThe pulleys are cast, but it is expected that wrought pul-leys much lighter will soon come into general use.\nHollow shafting is finding much favour.\nIf constructed of steel, the saving of power would probably be greatly increased.",
