Carl T. Pihl and P. Krag have commenced business at Christiania as timber and commission agents, under the style of Pihl & Krag. Their telegraphic address is Pihl, Christiania.\n* * *\nTHE MAYOR OF DOVER, Mr. W. H. Crundall, gave an excellent entertainment to the inmates of the Dover workhouse last week. On this occasion, cakes, &c., and tobacco and snuff were given to the old men and women, who very heartily cheered Mr. Crundall.\n* * *\nREMOVAL.—Messrs. J. E. & S. Spencer, engineers, have removed to 14, Great St. Thomas Apostle, Cannon Street, London, E.C. Their warehouse will be at Bow Bridge (Mansion House Station), where all kinds of tubes and fittings will be stocked.\n* * *\nMR. GUSTAV SCHMIDT, who traded under the style of G. Schmidt & Co., Riga, has transferred his business of export and commission agent to his manager, Mr. Eugen Lampe, together with his liabilities and book debts. Mr. Eugen Lampe will continue the business in his own name.\n* * *\nDOVER.—Messrs. Steriker Finnis & Sons are about to erect new saw-mills at the side of the river, between Biggin Street and Maison Dieu Road. The plans have been approved by the Dover Town Council. The chimney of the mills will be 80 ft. high, and a smoke-consuming apparatus will be fixed to each furnace.\n* * *\nMESSRS. GEORGE SMITH & Co., Commercial Road, Grosvenor Canal, Pimlico, S.W., have issued a circular stating, owing to the altered conditions of the building trades, they have added the following specialities to their old-established saw-mill and timber business: painting and artistic decorations, joinery and wood carving, masonry, granite, marble, &c., general smith's work, and an electrical department.\n* * *\nACCIDENT WITH A CIRCULAR SAW.—While at work on Monday, at Messrs. Bainton's saw-mills, in Melbourne Street, Southsea, a sawyer named Albert Taylor, 26 years of age, of 5, Prince's Street, had his left hand caught by a circular saw, by which four of his fingers were severely injured. He was taken to the hospital, and it is probable that two of the fingers will have to be amputated.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTRADE FORECAST.\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nSIR,—Nothing has occurred to cause me to alter the figures I gave in your issue of Jan. 8 for Swedish deals, battens, and boards.\nSundswall timber will sell at 30s. for 1st quality 26/27 cubic feet average, 32s. 6d. for 1st quality 30 cubic feet average.\nFirewood, if not pressed upon the market just now, will fetch 60 and 50.\nFor 3/4 in. staves £3 7s. 6d. is the figure at which business can be done.—I am, sir, your obedient servant,\nVERITAS.\nLondon, 13th January, 1887.\n\nPUBLIC AUCTIONS.\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.\nSIR,—In answer to \"Merchant's\" letter in your last issue, I might retaliate by saying that he was not a merchant at all. His animosity to the public auctions is quite out of harmony with the title he arrogates to himself. I observe that he omits all criticism of my remarks about consignment cargoes. I have not leisure now to go into a further defence of public sales, but will take up the cudgel again on some future occasion.—Yours,\nDEALER.\nLondon, January 20th, 1887.\n\nTHE sale of the Exhibition buildings was commenced at South Kensington, on Wednesday. There was a very meagre attendance of buyers, and the prices realised were very poor. \"Old London\" was sold to Messrs. Humphreys, of Knightsbridge, for £160 15s., the Indian pavilion fetched £63.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
