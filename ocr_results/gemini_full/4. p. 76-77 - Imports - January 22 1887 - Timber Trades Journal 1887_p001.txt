ACCIDENT WITH A CIRCULAR SAW.—While at work on Monday, at Messrs. Bainton's saw-mills, in Melbourne Street, Southsea, a sawyer named Albert Taylor, 26 years of age, of 5, Prince's Street, had his left hand caught by a circular saw, by which four of his fingers were severely injured. He was taken to the hospital, and it is probable that two of the fingers will have to be amputated.

CORRESPONDENCE.
TRADE FORECAST.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—Nothing has occurred to cause me to alter the figures I gave in your issue of Jan. 8 for Swedish deals, battens, and boards.
Sundswall timber will sell at 30s. for 1st quality 26/27 cubic feet average, 32s. 6d. for 1st quality 30 cubic feet average.
Firewood, if not pressed upon the market just now, will fetch 60 and 50.
For 3/4 in. staves £3 7s. 6d. is the figure at which business can be done.—I am, sir, your obedient servant,
VERITAS.
London, 13th January, 1887.

PUBLIC AUCTIONS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
SIR,—In answer to "Merchant's" letter in your last issue, I might retaliate by saying that he was not a merchant at all. His animosity to the public auctions is quite out of harmony with the title he arrogates to himself. I observe that he omits all criticism of my remarks about consignment cargoes. I have not leisure now to go into a further defence of public sales, but will take up the cudgel again on some future occasion.—Yours,
DEALER.
London, January 20th, 1887.

THE sale of the Exhibition buildings was commenced at South Kensington, on Wednesday. There was a very meagre attendance of buyers, and the prices realised were very poor. "Old London" was sold to Messrs. Humphreys, of Knightsbridge, for £160 15s., the Indian pavilion fetched £63.
