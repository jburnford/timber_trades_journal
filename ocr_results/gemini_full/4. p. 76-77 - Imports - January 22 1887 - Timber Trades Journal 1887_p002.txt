[FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.]
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
BARBER, HENRY, builder, 184, High Holborn, W.C.—The receiving order in this case was made on December 14th, and accounts have been filed showing unsecured liabilities £1,151 7s. 6d., against assets £267 16s. 7d. The debtor states that he commenced business about ten years ago in a small way, without capital, but he considers that he was about solvent at December, 1883. He attributes his failure to losses on contracts, and to his profits having been insufficient to provide for his household, personal, and other expenses; and he explains his deficiency thereby by bad debts, interest on borrowed money, and by depreciation in the value of his effects, as estimated for realisation. The debtor's books do not sufficiently disclose his financial position, or account for his deficiency. The stock-in-trade, plant, office furniture, &c., have been valued for realisation at £27 13s. 11d., and the household furniture (less excepted articles) at £20 3s. The landlord has taken possession of the property for rent. The debtor, on his consent, has been adjudged bankrupt.
BOSLEY, JAMES, builder, of Reading.—This was an 1886 case in the County Court at Reading, the debtor having carried on business as a builder and brickmaker, being described as of Burchetts Green, Reading. Mr. Cecil Mercer, of Victoria Street, Westminster, Official Receiver for the district, has issued a statement showing the total sum received and the amount expended in realising the same. The estate was estimated by the debtor to produce £452 9s., the total receipts are, however, £295 8s. 1d., upon which an unsecured first dividend of 6s. in the pound is now declared on £246 17s. 2d., the sum of £44 being devoted to the preferential creditors. These two items make together £118 1s. 2d. The cost of realisation has been £87 7s. 4d., the allowance to the debtor £5, and there is a balance in hand of £13 3s. 11d. The assets not yet realised are estimated to produce £5 or £10.
BROWN, J. H., builder, 82, Junction Road, N., and 84, King's Road, Camden Town.—The debtor, trading as J. H. Brown & Son, has filed his petition, and on Wednesday the Court made the usual receiving order.
CHICK & PAPE, builders and contractors, East Dulwich, S.E.—The meeting for public examination in this case (previously reported) was held on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The debts were returned at £225 13s. 2d. and the assets at £330, subject to a question as to the right to certain materials and plant which had been seized by the Home Counties House Property Company, Woolwich. Pape had died since the receiving order, and no opposition being offered to the other bankrupt he passed his examination.
CULVERHOUSE, A. & F., contractors, Camden Town, N.W.—The first meeting under this failure was held before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver, on Tuesday; the debtors also carrying on business at the East Park Brickfields, Hampstead. The joint statement of affairs disclosed gross liabilities to the amount of £50,972, of which £19,907 were expected to rank, and assets estimated at £2,608. It appeared from the Official Receiver's observations that the debtors commenced business in partnership in March, 1877, with a little money of their own, and stock, plant, &c., of the value of about £2,000 derived from their father (with whom Alfred Culverhouse had been associated as a partner), who then retired from the business, and who has lent the debtors money from time to time, in respect of which he is now entered in the liabilities as an unsecured creditor for £13,000. The debtors attributed their failure mainly to heavy losses by bad debts through builders. Their books had been imperfectly kept. Mr. Rooke, who appeared for the debtors, offered a composition of 5s. in the pound, payable in two instalments at one and three months from the date of approval, the first to be secured by the deposit of the necessary funds with the Official Receiver, and the second by the promissory notes of the debtors and their father, Mr. John Culverhouse. Mr. Mollett, representing Eastwood & Co., Limited, creditors for £500 odd, addressed the meeting in opposition to the proposal, insisting that there were various matters which demanded investigation, and that the case ought to go into bankruptcy. The contrary view was, however, expressed by several speakers, and in the result the debtors' proposition was almost unanimously entertained, Mr. Vernon, accountant, Basinghall

Street, being entrusted with the receipt and distribution of the composition.
EDWARDS, JOHN.—This failure was reported last week. Bankrupt attended at the Bristol Bankruptcy Court on Friday, and was examined by the Official Receiver, who said the statement showed more than 20s. in the pound, but whether the trustee (Mr. W. H. Parsons) would get 20s. he could not tell. The examination was adjourned.
FORD, HENRY, builder, Tisbury.—This failure has been previously reported. The bankrupt attended at the Salisbury Bankruptcy Court on Friday, before Mr. Registrar Aston Dawes. Mr. Wilson, Mr. F. A. Jones, of the Board of Trade, Mr. W. C. Powning the trustee, Mr. William Baker, and Mr. Whitethem, solicitor, the debtor. The Official Receiver said he did not propose to ask any questions, but there was a £250, which was put there down in a lump sum. Bankrupt said there was no chance of his paying a composition. The Official Receiver said everybody who knew anything about the affairs was aware that there was a large sum of money put into the hands of relatives just before criminal proceedings were taken against the debtor's brother-in-law, and that money must be somewhere. In reply to Mr. Powning debtor said his brother-in-law owed him £328 0s. 7d. for building some houses. He had paid for materials £264 9s. 2d., but the items were not entered in the books. He had, however (and produced it), a memorandum of the items. The matter was adjourned.
FOULKES, JOHN.—This debtor is a timber merchant, and carried on business as J. Foulkes & Son, at Rhyl, Flintshire. He has filed a statement of affairs, which discloses liabilities to unsecured creditors amounting to £1,029 13s. 1d. The fully secured creditors are £5 3s., and the surplus value of the security is £9 17s.; liability to partly secured creditors amount to £318 8s. 11d., the estimated value of the securities being £264 10s., leaving £53 18s. 11d. to rank for dividend. Liabilities on bills amount to £26 13s. 5d., but none of this is expected to rank against the estate. Creditors for rent, wages, &c., claim £13 14s. 2½d., of which £9 16s. 8d. is payable in full. The total unsecured liabilities amount to £1,087 9s. 6d. The assets consist of stock-in-trade £17, good book debts £69 11s. 4d., doubtful and bad £143 7s. 5d., estimated to produce £76 3s. 5d., bills of exchange £2 9s. 4d., bills of exchange £13 13s. 5d., securities in hands of creditors £9 17s., other property £23, surplus from securities in the hands of fully secured creditors £9 17s., making a total of £187 14s. 6d. The assets, allowing for payment of preferential claims £9 16s. 8d., leaves a deficiency of £909 11s. 8d. The following are the creditors :—

GOLD, HENRY, coachbuilder, Windsor and Long Acre.—The public examination in this matter has just taken place at the Windsor Court. Mr. Registrar Darvill presided, and Mr. C. W. Colwill represented Mr. Cecil Mercer (the Official Receiver), of Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W. The debtor was legally represented by Mr. Durnford, and the trustee (Mr. Percy Mason, of King Street, Cheapside, E.C.) by Mr. Read. The debtor was examined at considerable length on his trading and financial position, and in answer to the questions of the Deputy Official Receiver he stated that he had been carrying on business at Windsor and Long Acre, London, for many years past ; he had been carrying on business for about eighteen years at Windsor, and since 1876 at Long Acre. He was not able to say what capital he started with at Long Acre, but he had about £40 or £50 when he commenced at Windsor. He was formerly in partnership with his brother at Windsor, but this partnership was dissolved about the year
