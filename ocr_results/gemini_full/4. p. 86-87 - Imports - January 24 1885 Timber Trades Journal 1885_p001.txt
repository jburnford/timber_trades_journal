EPPS'S COCOA.—GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.
—"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills.
It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease.
Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point.
We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame."—*Civil Service Gazette*.—Made simply with boiling water or milk.
Sold only in Packets, labelled—"JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London."

THE WORLD'S INDUSTRIAL & COTTON EXPOSITION AT NEW ORLEANS.

This International Exhibition should be seen by all who can find the time.
No visitor is ever likely to forget his impressions of the magnificent Corliss Engines which give motion to the 10,600 feet of shafting, or of the marvellous ease with which the enormous power to develop is transmitted by the immense belts.
As the huge fair is, above everything, an Exposition of Cotton Manufacture in the greatest cotton-growing district of the world, and in keeping with "the eternal fitness of things" that these enormous belts should also be of cotton.
Four of the large engines are supplied with them, the largest belt being sixty inches wide.
It is an interesting fact that the Americans were the first to adopt the transmission of power from the engine by the means of belts, as also the first to use Cotton Belts, which are now by universal testimony conceded to be superior to every other kind.
These four large Cotton Belts were made specially for this great Exposition by the Gandy Belting Co., of Baltimore, London, Liverpool, Hamburg, Paris, and Vienna.
