FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
HENRY WILLIAM NEWELL.—The debtor, a builder and contractor of Bognor (and whose failure has been previously reported), was further examined at the Brighton Bankruptcy Court, on the 15th inst. In reply to the Official Receiver (Mr. A. Mackintosh), bankrupt stated that he had been bankrupt in 1873, with liabilities, so far as he could recollect, amounting to £700 or £800, and his creditors got nothing, as his trustee absconded. The present failure was mainly caused through undertaking, on borrowed capital, an unprofitable building contract at Handcross. He was allowed to pass his examination.
THOMAS KINGSFORD WOOD GATES.—This failure has been previously reported. The bankrupt was formerly a builder and contractor of Stanford Avenue, Brighton. The adjourned public examination was held at the Brighton Bankruptcy Court, on the 15th inst., before Mr. Registrar Jennings. In answer to the Official Receiver, debtor stated that he commenced business five years ago without any capital. It transpired that he had mortgaged several properties, and had returned as assets estimated surpluses over the amount of the mortgage ; but these were of rather an illusory character, as one property, on which the debtor reckoned a surplus of £100, had failed at public auction to excite the offers even of the amount of the mortgage. The Official Receiver allowed the debtor to pass his examination.
STEPHEN CONEY.—Bankrupt is a builder and wheelwright, of Vicarage Terrace, Rottingdean, and attended to pass his public examination at the last sitting of the Brighton Bankruptcy Court. Mr. Frederick G. Clark, chartered accountant, of Brighton, had been appointed trustee, and stated that it was estimated that the estate would fully realize 20s. in the pound. Bankrupt was allowed to pass his examination.

EDWARD LAKE.—The bankrupt, trading as a builder at 4, Park Place, Hackney, under the firm of Lake & Co., filed his petition in June last, and he applied to the Court last week for his order of discharge. The unsecured debts were stated in the accounts at £863 6s. 9d., and debts fully secured £1,500 ; assets £160 17s. 4d. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt's books did not fully record his business transactions, and that in 1862 he had paid a composition of 8s. in the pound to his creditors, his debts being then about £100. Under these circumstances Mr. Aldridge submitted that the bankrupt was not entitled to his immediate order of discharge. After hearing Mr. Finch on the bankrupt's behalf, Mr. Registrar Hazlitt said that public policy required that a trader should keep proper books for the information of his creditors as well as of himself. The discharge must be suspended for three months.
A. R. CRANCH.—The meeting for public examination in this case (reported last week) was held on Saturday before Mr. Registrar Murray. The bankrupt, trading as a builder at 52, Mervan Road, Brixton, returned his unsecured debts at £3,175 6s. 0s. 7d., and debts fully secured £19,312 6s. 11d. ; assets, estimated surplus from securities, £4,120 4s. 7d. The trustee (Mr. J. F. Lovering) appeared in person and said that he had only that morning received his certificate of appointment from the Board of Trade. A scheme of settlement was on foot, under which he believed that a composition of 7s. 6d. in the pound would be paid to the creditors. All the property was mortgaged, and the assets consisted only of the equities of redemption. In reply to the Official Solicitor, the bankrupt stated that he kept a ledger and day-book, not a cash-book. He did not remember up to what date they were posted. He first became aware that he was insolvent in May last. He had never failed before. By Mr. Nicholls (his solicitor).—The surplus he had returned as assets estimated consisted of equities of redemption, and it was very good property. Mr. Registrar Murray allowed the bankrupt to pass his examination.
W. C. ELLIS.—The first meeting of the creditors of William C. Ellis, of Ingerson Road, Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's Bush, builder, was held last week under the presidency of Mr. G. Wreford, one of the Assistant Official Receivers. The receiving order was made on the 6th November on the petition of Messrs. Maxwell & Thomson, of 210A, Upper Thames Street, and the accounts which had been filed showed fully secured debts to the amount of £3,702 15s., the value of the securities being estimated at £4,389. The assets consisted mainly of the estimated surplus from securities, and as the unsecured debts were only £466 the statement showed more than 20s. in the pound. The debtor attributed his failure to his inability to sell the houses built by him, or to obtain further advances thereon, as expected, and to loss of rents and accumulation of interest on mortgages, gages, ground rents, &c., whilst houses were unlet. The securities are mortgages on the debtor's freehold properties. The Court had made an order for the summary administration of the estate. Appended is a list of the creditors:—

At this meeting Mr. Rosenthal appeared for the debtor, and Mr. Ward for creditors. Some discussion took place on an offer of a composition of 1s. in the pound, payable before the application to the Court to approve the scheme, and it was explained that though the estate showed a surplus on paper, yet there was no probability of realizing, as the mortgagees had entered on possession of the property, were receiving the rents, and had threatened to sell. Although the rents were more than sufficient to cover the interest, there was a considerable sum in arrear, and it would take eighteen months to get rid of those arrears, even if the property were all let. Several creditors complained strongly of the action of one creditor, who refused a composition of 10s. in the pound.
