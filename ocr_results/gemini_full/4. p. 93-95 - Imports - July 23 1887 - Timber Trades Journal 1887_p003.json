D. M. Page, solicitor, of Portland Street, Southampton, has presented a petition in bankruptcy, in the local Bankruptcy Court, on behalf of this debtor, and the Registrar, Mr. John Daw, has made the usual receiving order constituting Mr. J. C. Mobberley, Official Receiver, receiver of the estate and effects.\nBATCHELOR, WM., contractor, Forest Hill.—This matter was before the Greenwich Court on Wednesday last on the application of the debtor for his discharge. The Official Receiver reported that the debtor had neglected to keep proper books, and that he had continued to trade with a knowledge of his insolvency, which he said was the result of rash and hazardous speculation. His Honour, having reviewed the facts of the case, granted the discharge, but suspended it for nine months.\nBONIFACE, W. & H., cabinet-makers, Southampton.—The sitting for the adjourned examination was held last week before Mr. Registrar Daw. In reply to Mr. Bell, the senior debtor repeated the answers previously given with reference to the removal of goods by Mr. Furber. The Registrar said that he had not allowed the debtors to pass on the ground that they had not disclosed their affairs, and he was also of opinion, though he had not the power to deal with this himself, that if the trustee thought there was sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution, the Court would order it. He should adjourn the examination sine die.\nBROOKE, WM., joiner, Middle Road Earlsheaton, near Dewsbury.—The statement of affairs in this matter is as follows :—To unsecured creditors £927 13s. 3d., creditors fully secured £43 5s. 7d., less estimated value of securities £100, leaving a surplus of £56 14s. 5d. to contra, total £927 13s. 3d. Assets: By household furniture £17 18s. stock in shop, yard, and shed £35 6s., wood shed £10, book debts £17 15s. 8d., estimated to produce £15, surplus from securities in the hands of creditors fully secured £56 18s. 5d. total £134 18s. 5d., less preferential creditors for rent, rates, taxes, and wages, payable in full, £22 4s. 2d., leaving net assets £112 14s. 3d., and showing a deficiency of £814 19s. The following are the principal creditors:—\nUNSECURED. £ s. d.\nGloyue T.

Mr. F. Ellen, of the firm of Howe, Percival, & Ellen, Northampton, appeared on behalf of the debtor, who, in reply to the Official Receiver, Mr. Mitchell, stated that he had been in business about three years, and his deficiency amounted to over £1,000. He had made a profit on all his contracts; but attributed his deficiency partly to losing money from the assistance he gave two of his five sons, to assisting his sister, and cost of living, which amounted to about £3 per week. After being further questioned, the examination was adjourned until August 2nd.\n\n95\nBROWNING, JAMES, builder and contractor.—An application has been made by Mr. James Neal, builder and contractor, of Spencer Road, New Wandsworth, whose solicitor is Mr. C. H. de Grey Robertson, of 13, South Square, Gray's Inn, for a receiving order against the debtor in this matter, who is described as of 40, Gaisford Road, Kentish Town, Middlesex, tractor.—The debtor, lately carrying on business at Westbury, St. Paul's Square, Thornton Heath, Surrey. The application was granted, and the receiving order made in the Croydon Court on the 9th June, and the order for summary administration on the 4th July. The debtor was also adjudicated on the 22nd June. No particulars have as yet been issued. Friday, the 15th inst., was fixed for the public examination, before Mr. Registrar Fox. On that day, however, of Mr. Herbert Shortcliffe, who attended on behalf of Mr. Mercer, the Official Receiver, the examination was adjourned until August.\nDAISH, ALBERT, undertaker, Hope Cottage, Ventnor, I.W.—The first meeting of creditors was held at St. John's Chambers, Ventnor, on the 1st inst., before Mr. S. Wheeler, Official Receiver. Mr. Urry, the debtor's solicitor, said he should have been able to pilot the debtor over his difficulties had not a creditor issued execution. The debtor made an offer of 10s. in the pound payable 5s. in the pound at one month, and 5s. in the pound at twelve months, the last to be guaranteed. It was decided to entertain this offer.\nDAVIS, TOM, builder and contractor, Parkstone.—The sitting for the public examination of this debtor was held at the Poole Bankruptcy Court before Mr. Registrar Dickinson, when, in reply to the Official Receiver, debtor said he commenced business about fourteen years ago. He had five freehold houses at Canford and three at Boscombe. From time to time he had drawn money from the mortgagees to carry on the building operations. He was still of opinion that he was not insolvent, even if the properties were sold at cost and not selling prices. He had no book showing his income during the last three years. No furniture had been removed from his residence during the last six months. The Registrar said he had no further questions to ask. If the debtor's view were correct he had every reason to believe he would pull through his difficulties. The examination was then closed.\nDAWSON, THOMAS, carpenter, &c., Sutton, Surrey.—The adjourned public examination has just taken place in this matter before Mr. H. Shirtcliffe, Deputy Official Receiver. The debtor began business about twenty-five years ago without capital, and he attributes his failure to bad trade and loss on contracts. He has kept two books (day book and ledger), but the Official Receiver says they afford little or no information as to his business transactions and financial position. The examination was again adjourned.\nDES VIGNES, GEORGE FRANCIS GABRIEL.—At the County Court, held at Kingston last week, before Mr. Registrar Bell, this bankrupt appeared for public examination. The Official Receiver (Mr. Stoneham) was represented by his deputy, Mr. T. Britten, who put a large number of questions, in answer to which debtor said he first commenced business at Tulse Hill, in 1867. Perhaps he could hardly call it a business, as he commenced building small steamers for his own amusement. In those days his father, with whom he lived, used to give him what capital he wanted. Left Tulse Hill about 1870, went to Marshgate, Stratford, and entered into partnership. The result was that he lost a considerable sum of the £2,000 left him by his grandmother. The partnership was dissolved in 1872 or 1873, and the terms of the dissolution were very much in favour of his partner, who went into the Bankruptcy Court and lost all he was going to have paid him. His partner was to have paid £1,600 or £1,700, but he only got £200 or £300; in fact, it was so long ago that he almost forgot the circumstance. Left Stratford soon after the dissolution, and went to Chertsey, in 1875, with about £1,000 capital. Since then he had had about £8,000 more, what he had had his property, partly by machinery he took with him. He had another partner at Chertsey, who, he thought, \"put in\" £2,800. Said partner gave him personally £700 for his (debtor's) share of the goodwill. Had no papers relating to that. Paid his partner £900 or £950 to go out. The partnership was dissolved in 1877, and he had wanted money he went to Messrs. Ashby, bankers, who practically kept the business going. Knew that without their help he would have been closed.",
