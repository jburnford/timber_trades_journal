NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," June 9th.)
With summer now upon us, there is naturally some increase of the distribution of lumber, and we occasionally find a dealer who really puts in a claim of being "pretty busy." The general movement, however, scarcely assumes such form as to convey an impression that it will expand into liberal proportions, and buyers come forward with a "handle me tenderly" sort of tone, which plainly indicates the futility of an attempt to force, coax, or frighten them into operations beyond a basis of positive wants. Most dealers have learned wisdom on this score long ago, and the general tendency is to meet all calls for negotiations on a fair basis; keep terms as attractive as circumstances will admit, and start as much lumber toward consumption as possible. For a rise in value to some fixed point, many have for some time past added a certain amount of pluck, but has not for a great many dollars to bank accounts; while on the other hand prompt sales of all goods giving a clear margin for profit, and close figuring on undesirable supplies, even down to actual cost if needs be, has brought a great many of the trade thus far through the dull period in much better shape than might have been expected.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," May 30th.)
Trade during the past week has moved along as gently as a summer cloud, presenting no new features worthy of food for special comment. There has been no rush of buyers, though a few have put in an appearance daily, which, taken with orders received by letter or local representatives, has been enough to relieve the monotony for both manufacturers and inspectors. About the middle of last week quite a large fleet arrived, which have for the most part been loaded and set out for their destinations again, while still others are now reporting, so that the shipments at present are very satisfactory, freights being firmly maintained at opening quotations.
Buyers and sellers are watching with interest manoeuvres in lumber quotations at Chicago and points along the Mississippi, earnestly hoping that an advance may yet be made and maintained which will be much more satisfactory to the trade in general than the rates which have prevailed for months past; but there have been no active steps in that direction here on the river, from the fact that trade has been so indifferent that operators have feared to meddle with it lest it be discouraged entirely.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," May 31st.)
The receipts of lumber during the week past have been lighter than usual, and cargoes have not been kept long in waiting for customers. Another advance of 25 cents on piece stuff has been made, the price now being firm at 7.50 dols. The advance has not been strongly felt in boards and strips, though the figures are much firmer than a week ago. As the news from the drives shows no better prospects for logs it is being slowly but surely forced upon the minds of a majority of operators that prices must go up instead of down. They are so well used to the latter that it is the hardest kind of work for them to brace up sufficiently to seriously contemplate the former. From present indications Chicago's receipts for 1877 will be less than last year by something like 100,000,000 feet. The new lumber will not begin to crowd the market until late in the season anyway, and nothing short of emotional insanity would be supposed to induce a man to dispose of his lumber at less than the quoted figures, or make him very anxious to do so at that.
It is clear that the advances will be made very slowly, and only as the state of the market forces them.

for some few weeks yet. There will in all probability be a very appreciable per-centage hung, but the June rains must be waited for before it will be possible to state the amount in figures. The logs that have found their way to safe floating limits are now coming along quite satisfactorily, and pretty fair work for the season is being done at the major portion of the booms.

THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman and Manufacturer," June 1st.)
The situation continues to grow interestingly "dry in the Mississippi Valley, and may be tersely expressed by saying, "things is workin'." The season has come when one-half the crop of logs should be in the booms, and no new logs have been secured, while the chances to secure more than half a crop grows more remote every hour, and the same story of dry weather, and hung-up drives comes from the shores of Lake Michigan, until it becomes almost an established fact that the stocks of lumber on the western markets are to be reduced to almost nothing, even if the meagre crops of last year are duplicated, but with the bountiful harvest which nature seems to be providing from Lake Superior to Texas, the outlook becomes more promising than it has for a series of years, not only for lumbermen, but for common people as well.
Speaking more specifically, instead of the Mississippi Valley sending out fifteen hundred million feet of lumber as she did last year, it is doubtful if she can furnish half that amount, or taking into account the stocks on hand, whether there can be secured as much as there was sold last year.

ALBANY.
(From the "Albany Argus," May 29th.)
We are having free arrivals of Michigan lumber, much of which will go forward on recent purchases, so that there will be no great addition to stock. There is not any change in prices, and the business is moderate.
There is very little Canada lumber coming in.
We hear of nothing to change the condition of the drives in Michigan or Canada—the logs are still hung up. From Minnesota it is reported that recent heavy rains have released all the logs on the streams tributary to the Upper Mississippi.
Coarse lumber, allowing for a slight check caused by a break on Lake Champlain, is arriving freely. The demand continues good, and prices are without change.
The deal shipments from New York since our last are about 40,000 pieces to Cork and Liverpool.

DARIEN.
(From the "Darien Timber Gazette," June 1st.)
Our timber market of late has assumed almost a stagnant appearance; but little of either square or scab timber being down, the bulk being scab timber. Prices have fallen, and the desire for purchasing has considerably slackened. We may attribute the foregoing to the following facts :— Firstly, the season may be considered over, there being only a few more vessels bound for this port, and the wants of all tonnage in port are provided for, consequently there is no immediate demand for timber in the market. Secondly, the great depression of trade in the United Kingdom and on the continent of Europe has proved so fatal and severe to our shippers during the season whose close they now so gladly welcome, that they fain would wait awhile to get a better insight into the prospect of the future, before entering into the speculation of re-stocking their booms. It is our opinion that the war in the event of England not entering the battle-field, there is a fair chance of our timber market on hand with rafts in the fall. We would advise timber cutters to be on hand with rafts of well-manufactured timber about the last of September, when in any case they may calculate on getting high prices. Our ideas for the present are, that about three or four million feet of scab timber would meet with ready sales at a good living price. About eight hundred feet average good square is wanted by one or two shippers for almost immediate shipment.
