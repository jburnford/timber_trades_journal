  "text": "boards, Messrs. Joseph Thompson & Co. have a return two cargoes, 380 loads from Christiansand and 370 loads from Soderhamn, and Mr. Joseph Harrison and Messrs. J. & W. Wilson & Sons one each, the former 230 loads from Hernosand, and the latter 380 loads from Gefle.\nThe other arrivals refer solely to pitwood, the principal contribution being the steamship Hugin, one of the regular traders, which brings, in addition to the usual assorted cargo, 26,334 fencing rails.\nThe Lambton Company have one of their steamers discharging part cargo from Ostend, Messrs. Mitahel, Pedersen, & Co. have about 180 loads long pitwood from Carlskrona, and Messrs Pyman, Bell, & Co. have a little over of 180 loads Norway timber, which complete the week's trade.\nComplaints have again come under our notice in reference to the want of a watchman or policeman at South Dock.\nThe River Wear Commissioners certainly save a few pounds annually by this penny wise and pound foolish principle, but the loss to merchants not to mention the annoyance is becoming of so serious a nature that something must be done to afford protection for their goods, which at the present time are at the mercy of the gang of roughs who infest the dock from one week's end to the other.\nGRIMSBY.\nThe import of wood goods into Grimsby during the past week has been active, as will be seen on reference to our import list.\nThe departures have been the Villa, Pride for Ipswich with deals, and the Amity for Yarmouth with deals.\nThe arrivals include six steamers and fifteen sailing vessels, which combined form quite a fleet of wood-laden ships.\nAs may be supposed the scene at the docks is a very busy one, but the facilities for dealing with such a large arrival are since the opening of the Alexandra Dock excellent.\nThere is little change to report in the attitude of the trade; there is a fair average business doing, but individual merchants assert they are slack and that they find trade dull.\nThe old town put on its holiday dress noon the occasion of the visit of Prince Albert Victor on Thursday to Cleethorpes, when in the presence of a large and influential company he opened the new promenade and p'easure grounds.\nAn interruption of local business is usual, arising out of the election for the North Division of the county, arising from one of the late members, Mr. Rowland Winn, being elevated to the peerage.\nThe division is being hotly contested, the conservative member being Alderman J. Atkinson, of the shipping firm of Brown, Atkinson & Co., of Hull.\nGLASGOW.\nAn auction sale of deals was held here on 30th ult., the bulk of the catalogue consisting of Quebec deals recently landed ex steam liners.\nOnly a few lots were sold, prices as noted below.\nFor various other lots offers were made, but as the bidding did not come up to the exposer's values the goods were withdrawn.\nVery fair prices, it will be observed, were given for the lots disposed of.\nThe company met was not large.\nThe following are particulars of the stock of deals at Clyde ports as at 30th ult., compared with the quantity held at 30th June, 1884 :—\n1885. 1884.\n(Pcs.) (Pcs.)\nQuebec 1st yellow pine deals 14,229 12,253\n„ 2nd „ „ „ 6,927 2,797\n„ 3rd „ „ „ 27,676 38,203\n„ 4th „ „ „ 20,060 43,234\n„ red pine deals ... 19,844 37,148\n„ spruce „ ... 26,889 65,993\nLower port spruce deals ... 61,912 62,163\n„ pine „ ... 49,164 49,425\nIn the quarterly comparative statement given below the deals are stated taking qualities lumped together.\nBoth of the timber and deals it will be observed that is on the whole lighter stock than that of a year ago.\nAs regards the shipbuilding on Clyde, the output for the past month amounts to 10 vessels, 19,965 tons, compared with 15 vessels, 32,756 tons, in June of last year.\nThe tonnage launched for the six months ending 30th June, 1885, amounts to 98,725 tons, and for same period 1884 the total was 148,826 tons.\nIt is encouraging, however, to\n\nadd that, though the recent returns show a deficiency in output, considerable compensation has been afforded by the booking of new orders.\nThe contracts secured during the past months, it is stated, amount to at least 25,000 tons.\nAUCTION SALE.\nOn 30th ult., at Glasgow, Messrs. Singleton Dunn, & Co., brokers :—\nQuebec 1st yellow pine deals—\n12 ft. 11/20x3 3s. 3d. per c. ft.\nDo. 1st yellow pine—\n8 ft. 11x3 2s. 6 1/2d. „\n6 to 8 ,, 7/22x3 2s. 5d. „\nDo. 3rd yellow pine—\n12 ft. 14/20x3 1s. 6 1/2d. „\n16 ,, 11x3 1s. 2d. „\n10 ,, 11x3 1s. 1d. „\nNOTE OF LEADING WOOD GOODS ON HAND AT CLYDE PORTS AT 30TH JUNE, 1883, 1884, 1885.\n185[?] 1884. 1883.\nLoads (50 cub. ft)\nQuebec waney board wood ... 6,767 11,435 7,077\nQuebec yellow pine ... 17,121 19,941 4,752\n„ red pine ... 1,047 3,838 1,933\n„ elm ... 558 514 632\n„ ash ... 172 200 101\n„ oak logs ... 3,492 7,055 4,424\nOak planks ... 754 154 888\nBirch (all sorts) ... 933 1,030 188\nPitch pine (hewn) ... 6,877 6,421 6,723\n„ (sawn) ... 14,121 17,519 16,010\n„ (planks) ... 1,480 1,465 1,224\nTeak timber ... 3,039 4,696 4,809\nGreenheart ... 1,014 755 1,017\nThe Quebec yellow pine St. Pet.

W. Thomson & Co. held a public sale on the sands to clear the balance of the cargo of birch lately landed ex Killonan, from Halifax, N.S., and they included in their announcement some of miscellaneous wood goods belonging to other importers.\nThe attendance of buyers was very limited, but the brokers managed to clear out the birch, which was of small size, at 1 3/4d. to 1 3/4d. per cubic foot.\nVery little else was sold, except the sample lots of the other goods, which consisted of American ash, St Petersburg riekers, Sundswall red deals, and flooring, lining and sarking.\nOn Tuesday this week, Mr. D. W. Beattie held a sale of Baltic deals, battens, &c., at the Queen's Dock.\nThere was a very good attendance of both town and country buyers, and a considerable quantity of the various goods was disposed of, but there was no improvement to record in prices.\nA beginning was made with a cargo of Bjorneborg whitewood deals and battens of various dimensions and excellent quality, and the exposer seemed to have difficulty in reaching his limits for the goods, but ultimately the bulk of the cargo was sold.\nAfter selling a small cargo of Holmestrand battens and scantlings and some Drontheim red 9x3 deals an adjournment was made to the exposer's yard on the south side of the Queen's Dock, where a variety of other goods was offered and a fair quantity sold.\nThe following is a note of the principal prices obtained :—\nPer lin. ft.\n5x3 Bjorneborg white deals 1 1/4d. to 1 3/8d.\n7x3 „ „ battens 1 1/2d. „ 1 5/8d.\n6x2 1/2 „ „ „ 1 1/4d. „ 1 3/8d.\n6x2 1/2 Holmestrand „ 1 1/4d. „ 1 3/8d.\n6x2 „ „ „ 1d. „ 1 1/8d.\n5x2 „ „ „ 7/8d. „ 1d.\n9x3 Drontheim red deals ... 1 3/4d.\n9x3 Namsos white „ ... 1 1/4d.\n7x2 1/2 Sundswall red battens 1 1/4d. „ 1 3/8d.\n11x3 „ „ deals 2 1/2d.\n\n[JULY 4, 1885.]\nIMPORTS.\n(For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of shippers where they can be done.\nImports of mahogany, &c., will appear under the heading of \"Mahogany and other Hardwoods\" on another page.—ED.)\nENGLAND AND WALES.\nBEAUMARIS.\nJune 26 Vaar-Sherbrooke-4,913 deals and battens, 181 pcs. hewn fir-Order\nBERWICK-ON-TWEED.\nJune 26 Thora Sundswall-14 lds. firewood-C.
