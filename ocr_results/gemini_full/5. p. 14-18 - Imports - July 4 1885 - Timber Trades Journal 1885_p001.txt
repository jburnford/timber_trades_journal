boards, Messrs. Joseph Thompson & Co. have a return two cargoes, 380 loads from Christiansand and 370 loads from Soderhamn, and Mr. Joseph Harrison and Messrs. J. & W. Wilson & Sons one each, the former 230 loads from Hernosand, and the latter 380 loads from Gefle.
The other arrivals refer solely to pitwood, the principal contribution being the steamship Hugin, one of the regular traders, which brings, in addition to the usual assorted cargo, 26,334 fencing rails.
The Lambton Company have one of their steamers discharging part cargo from Ostend, Messrs. Mitahel, Pedersen, & Co. have about 180 loads long pitwood from Carlskrona, and Messrs Pyman, Bell, & Co. have a little over of 180 loads Norway timber, which complete the week's trade.
Complaints have again come under our notice in reference to the want of a watchman or policeman at South Dock.
The River Wear Commissioners certainly save a few pounds annually by this penny wise and pound foolish principle, but the loss to merchants not to mention the annoyance is becoming of so serious a nature that something must be done to afford protection for their goods, which at the present time are at the mercy of the gang of roughs who infest the dock from one week's end to the other.
GRIMSBY.
The import of wood goods into Grimsby during the past week has been active, as will be seen on reference to our import list.
The departures have been the Villa, Pride for Ipswich with deals, and the Amity for Yarmouth with deals.
The arrivals include six steamers and fifteen sailing vessels, which combined form quite a fleet of wood-laden ships.
As may be supposed the scene at the docks is a very busy one, but the facilities for dealing with such a large arrival are since the opening of the Alexandra Dock excellent.
There is little change to report in the attitude of the trade; there is a fair average business doing, but individual merchants assert they are slack and that they find trade dull.
The old town put on its holiday dress noon the occasion of the visit of Prince Albert Victor on Thursday to Cleethorpes, when in the presence of a large and influential company he opened the new promenade and p'easure grounds.
An interruption of local business is usual, arising out of the election for the North Division of the county, arising from one of the late members, Mr. Rowland Winn, being elevated to the peerage.
The division is being hotly contested, the conservative member being Alderman J. Atkinson, of the shipping firm of Brown, Atkinson & Co., of Hull.
GLASGOW.
An auction sale of deals was held here on 30th ult., the bulk of the catalogue consisting of Quebec deals recently landed ex steam liners.
Only a few lots were sold, prices as noted below.
For various other lots offers were made, but as the bidding did not come up to the exposer's values the goods were withdrawn.
Very fair prices, it will be observed, were given for the lots disposed of.
The company met was not large.
The following are particulars of the stock of deals at Clyde ports as at 30th ult., compared with the quantity held at 30th June, 1884 :—
1885. 1884.

„ pine „ ... 49,164 49,425
In the quarterly comparative statement given below the deals are stated taking qualities lumped together.
Both of the timber and deals it will be observed that is on the whole lighter stock than that of a year ago.
As regards the shipbuilding on Clyde, the output for the past month amounts to 10 vessels, 19,965 tons, compared with 15 vessels, 32,756 tons, in June of last year.
The tonnage launched for the six months ending 30th June, 1885, amounts to 98,725 tons, and for same period 1884 the total was 148,826 tons.
It is encouraging, however, to

add that, though the recent returns show a deficiency in output, considerable compensation has been afforded by the booking of new orders.
The contracts secured during the past months, it is stated, amount to at least 25,000 tons.

LEITH.
Arrivals of wood-laden vessels have been much more numerous this last week, and the dock quays are getting well filled up.
There are still a number of sailing vessels with wood cargoes reported coming up as I write, so that the fleet may be said to be now fairly to hand.
The advent of so many cargoes has given some impetus to the trade this week, both from sales made to arrive being executed from ship's side and also from further sales being made, sellers being anxious and ready to give buyers every inducement to take delivery of goods in this way.
On Thursday last Messrs. W. Thomson & Co. held a public sale on the sands to clear the balance of the cargo of birch lately landed ex Killonan, from Halifax, N.S., and they included in their announcement some of miscellaneous wood goods belonging to other importers.
The attendance of buyers was very limited, but the brokers managed to clear out the birch, which was of small size, at 1 3/4d. to 1 3/4d. per cubic foot.
Very little else was sold, except the sample lots of the other goods, which consisted of American ash, St Petersburg riekers, Sundswall red deals, and flooring, lining and sarking.
On Tuesday this week, Mr. D. W. Beattie held a sale of Baltic deals, battens, &c., at the Queen's Dock.
There was a very good attendance of both town and country buyers, and a considerable quantity of the various goods was disposed of, but there was no improvement to record in prices.
A beginning was made with a cargo of Bjorneborg whitewood deals and battens of various dimensions and excellent quality, and the exposer seemed to have difficulty in reaching his limits for the goods, but ultimately the bulk of the cargo was sold.
After selling a small cargo of Holmestrand battens and scantlings and some Drontheim red 9x3 deals an adjournment was made to the exposer's yard on the south side of the Queen's Dock, where a variety of other goods was offered and a fair quantity sold.
The following is a note of the principal prices obtained :—
Per lin. ft.
5x3 Bjorneborg white deals 1 1/4d. to 1 3/8d.
7x3 „ „ battens 1 1/2d. „ 1 5/8d.
