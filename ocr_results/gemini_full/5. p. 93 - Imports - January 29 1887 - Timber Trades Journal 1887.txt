CAMPBELL & CO.'S ROLLER ORGANS.
Our readers, no less than the rest of their fellow-creatures, are, we presume, susceptible to the captivating, pleasing, and soothing melodies and harmonies of music. Shakespeare says:
“The man that hath not music in his soul,
Nor is not moved with the concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.”
As we feel certain our readers are not of this disposition and character, we may go a step further than presumption, and confidently assert that they are fond of music. If there are some who are not, then we recommend them to become fond of it. We can point out to them the way. Of course there is music and music. It is said, but with what truth we have not ascertained, that once upon a time a certain district of America was flooded, and that a local brass band gave a concert on behalf of the sufferers, whereupon the sufferers went out and drowned themselves, preferring the flood to the music. Such music must have resembled the Chinese band at the Inventions Exhibition, and not the kind produced from the instrument we now have pleasure in noticing, and which is styled the “Roller Organ.”
Handsomely encased in a polished cabinet of solid walnut, with a glass-panelled drop lid, it presents an appearance which makes it fit to grace any home in the three kingdoms, while it is manufactured at a cost that places it within the reach of everybody. Its most distinguishing and prominent feature is the production of music, entirely free from the harshness characteristic of most mechanical organs. The mechanism is simple and durable, not likely to get out of order, the reeds of full organ power and good workmanship and quality, and the range of tone, one of which it is capable is, for its size, simply astonishing; while it can be played softly enough for an ordinary cottage apartment, it can at will be made to emit a volume of music sufficient to fill a large hall. Of this an interesting instance was recently afforded at the Mining Industries Exhibition, held at Glasgow, where one of these organs was played, to the admiration and wonder of all present, the wonder being where all the music came from. This instrument may be obtained from the agents for the United Kingdom, Messrs. Campbell & Co., Trongate, Glasgow.
COLLIS'S BRANDING AND PRINTING MACHINES.
We would direct the attention of our readers to the advertisement of the patent branding and printing machines manufactured by Mr. J. Collis, Ironmonger Row, Old Street, London, E.C., to be found on another page of this issue. We have often had occasion to refer to Mr. Collis's machines in our “Practical Notes” columns, and in doing so we have unhesitatingly recommended them to inquirers.
AN EXCHANGE.—Timber merchants are very slow to move. Other trades keep more abreast of times. The advantages of a timber exchange are manifest, and they are emphasised by comparison with the importance and value attached to such an institution as an exchange by other trades. Although we have long advocated them, they are not appreciated by our readers. Whilst we have again to repeat it, timber merchants are considering other people have now decided to establish an exchange. A meeting was held last week in furtherance of the proposal, when it was the unanimous opinion of those present that such an exchange would afford grocers and provision merchants an opportunity of meeting to consider questions relating to the trade. Precisely; and no one can doubt that many things in the timber trade would improve by discussion and ventilation. Possibly such financial calamities as we have had, and are likely to have, so rumour mutters, would have been curtailed if not entirely prevented had an exchange been in existence.
