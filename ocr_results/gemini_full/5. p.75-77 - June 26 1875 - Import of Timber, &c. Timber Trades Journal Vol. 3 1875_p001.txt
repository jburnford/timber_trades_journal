THE TYNE.
(From our own Correspondent.)
June 24th, 1875.
The timber trade on this river remains in much the same position as during the last two or three months. The deliveries have not been augmented to any degree, and in fact for the better classes of deals there has been a good deal of inquiry, but not much to supply from. There is but little demand from iron-works or collieries, which two years ago were the great consumers; but the building trade being unusually brisk more than compensates for short deliveries to other branches of trade.
We already begin to find a great scarcity of house joiners and carpenters sufficient to keep the supply of houses up to the demand on all sides, there being a scarcity of houses, principally for the better class of workmen’s dwellings; hundreds have been erected during the last twelvemonth, and appear to find a ready and profitable market. We fully anticipate a steady, prosperous year for the trade, and have no doubt merchants will in some measure recoup themselves for the disastrous season of 1874.

WEST HARTLEPOOL.
(From our own Correspondent.)
June 23rd, 1875.
A small fleet of ships has arrived here during the past few days causing a scene of animation, such as we have not witnessed on the quays for some time, but we cannot say the demand increases proportionately with the imports, there are but few orders except for chiefly redwood, the heavy stocks of white and common redwood imported last year have been worked upon to the last; some firms have been able to clear out their stocks and so make room for fresh arrivals, but there are others who have supplies in hand for some months to come. A sale of Mexican mahogany and cedar, comprising 300 logs mahogany, 24 logs cedar, and 12 tons log ends, took place on the 22nd inst., on account of the importers by George Shadbolt and Sons, the local firms were well represented and a good many connected with the trade in the district were present; the prices realized were, for the best logs 6d. to 9d., the inferior wood and cedar log ends prices varying from 3½d. to 6d. per superficial foot, and the whole parcel being thus disposed of.

GLASGOW.
(From our own Correspondent.)
June 23rd, 1875.
Since the date of my last communication there has been a considerable quantity of Quebec pine deals landed at Yorkhill wharf, brought chiefly per trading steamers, and some parts as between-deck cargoes by sailing ships.
A public sale was recently called to try some of the fresh Quebec pine deals. The company brought together was good, but the prices they were disposed to give for the various qualities of the first lots of the first portion in the catalogue was withdrawn. A few lots of the first St. Petersburg quality sold @ from £19 18s. 9d. to £20 18s. 9d. per standard. The St. John N.B. spruce deals sold @ from £8 1s. 6d. to £8 11s. 10d., scantlings £6 3s. 9d. to £7 7s. 9d. There was no demand for the St. John pine deals.
The stock of spruce in the market at present is small. Sound deals of good dimensions would bring fair rates.
The ship builders on the Clyde who are our greatest wood consumers are not busy meantime, and do not speak encouragingly of future prospects, so far as can be seen at present. The house building, however, is now assuming rather a brisk appearance. Masons especially are very much wanted, and can easily command a high wage—so high as 9½d. per hour. The demand here, and at neighbouring wood depots

is, therefore, likely to improve bye and bye. But for the present it is to be observed that the advices received from Grangemouth show that the market there during last fortnight exhibits further signs of depression. The only class of goods in anything like fair demand is good quality Quebec timber. Freights are said to be scarcely enquired for. Current quotations much about the same as last reported. Current rates for timber at Greenock, Quebec oak, about 2s. 5d. per cub. ft. for good quality and large dimensions. Stocks are large and not much in demand. Elm, good quality about 50 feet per log, about 11s. 1d. Ash has been sold @ 17d., demand light; birch, Quebec and lower ports, say from 15d. to 20d. per cub. ft.

LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.)
June 23rd.
The timber trade still remains very quiet, and sales are very slow. There have been two sales by auction during the last fourteen days, but no advance in prices can be quoted; the attendance was very good, but the buyers very scarce.
The arrivals since my last have been considerably increased, say 34 against 61 in the corresponding fortnight last year. Amongst the arrivals are several cargoes Baltic square timber and 4 cargoes pitch pine, distributed, viz., 2 in Dundee, 1 Granton, and 1 Leith. Two cargoes will be the only cargo to arrive here this season. The sleepers expected for some time back are now arriving. Two vessels are discharging at Bo’ness, and a large steamer at Granton.
The only sale announced is for the 29th, Wm. Thomson and Co., at the Albert Docks, consisting of battens 6½ X 2½.
