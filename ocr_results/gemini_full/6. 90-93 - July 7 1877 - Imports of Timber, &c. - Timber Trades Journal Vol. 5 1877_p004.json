All sorts of manœuvring is resorted to in order to prevent too much stock coming upon sale, but success is moderate, and especially so in undesirable qualities. It is, however, almost impossible to regulate quality to the wants of the market just now, as the demand is variable, and what would be acceptable to buyers in attendance to-day might meet with instant rejection by those who would appear to-morrow. Building and manufacturing consumption is about equal at the moment, but we cannot hear of much doing for export on fresh orders. There were some rumours of considerable sales for both South America and West Indies, but we have been unable to trace anything beyond the ordinary quantities. Supplies are coming forward from the interior, and stocks fill up both in quantity and assortment, though naturally to only a moderate extent. Western agents are busy in their efforts to secure orders in their shipments through to this point, but are not over-successful, so far as known, beyond the placing of a few bills, very cheap and of standard quality, and sizes for regular stock accumulation.\n\nTHE SAGINAW VALLEY.\n(From the \"Lumberman's Gazette,\" June 13th.)\nThe first instalment of the historic \"June freshet\" has been received, and though it has not as yet raised the logging streams to any marked extent it still has been a considerable help in quenching the extensive forest fires which have been so seriously raging through the greater portion of the north-west during the past fortnight. It has also aided materially in soaking up the ground, supplying the swamps, and preparing the way for other supplies which the elements indicate are yet to come in greater or less quantities. We can safely conclude, therefore, before the present storm is fully passed the main streams will be sufficiently well replenished to bring down a large per-centage of the stock that drivers began to lose hopes of securing. How much of the smaller ones will be effected, of course, cannot as yet be determined, but no one is so sanguine as to expect anywhere near all of the logs upon them will be secured, however heavy the rains, from the fact that the water has been so low, and June floods are so soon dissipated, that many of the logs will be left high and dry again before they can be run into safe waters. But from present indications we will be secured for the healthy requirements of trade, and most of the manufacturers who see a likelihood of getting a reasonable per-centage of their logs appear to be about as contented as lumbermen are expected to be. A large number of men have started for the 'drives,' and another week will determine with what success.\nThe bush fires are now all extinguished, and although the losses are pretty considerable in some parts, early reports were greatly exaggerated, more especially as to the destruction of standing timber; but upon this point we can speak more specifically when definite advices are received from parties now visiting some of the burnt districts.\n\nCHICAGO.\n(From the \"North-western Lumberman,\" June 14th.)\nAs to the real state of feeling in this market little can be said. Operators themselves do not seem to have any decided opinion, at least they would not disgorge one upon any consideration. They are firm on the prices because they are compelled to be by the actual, living, tangible presence of a shortage in the receipts of over 20,000,000 feet. The yard men cannot do otherwise than stiffen up their backs on prices, when they cannot go down to the Franklin Street docks, and replace the lumber they sell for the money they get. They all seem to hold themselves in readiness to weaken at the slightest provocation, however, and there is no knowing what sort of foolishness will be perpetrated if the opportunity is presented.\nReports from the log-driving streams upon which this market depends are still very discouraging as to the probabilities of getting the logs. The prospects of the Menominee and other streams tributary to Green Bay, are really not so encouraging as a few weeks ago, as logs on the first-named stream, which were then considered safe, are now spoken of as very doubtful. There is no water and no prospect of any. The drive on the Muskegon, the largest stream sending stock to this market is progressing so slowly that unless heavy rains ensue, the logs will not reach the mills much before shutting-down time. The Manistee, which has always been considered absolutely safe, bids fair, as will be seen by reports elsewhere, to hang up nearly 30,000,000 feet of its stuck. June is now upon us, in fact the first quarter of it more than gone, we shall soon know what the fabulous \"June freshets\" are to do for the loggers.\n\nTHE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.\n(From the \"Lumberman and Manufacturer,\" June 7th.)\nWhile the situation remains unchanged so far as relates to the continuance of the drought and consequent difficulty in driving out the logs, considerable change is noticeable in the market for lumber.
