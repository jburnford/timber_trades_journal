McEwen\n\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in the lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\n\nJOHN BUCKLEY.—The first meeting of creditors in this case was made in June last. The bankrupt was then described as of 133, Canal-street, Nottingham, timber and saw-mill proprietor, and late of the Trent Saw-mills, and of the Saw-mills, Wilford-road, West Bridgford, saw-mill proprietor, and he filed his petition in the County Court on Saturday for his public examination. The liabilities were returned in the statement of affairs at £1,418 14s. 2d., and the assets at £258 16s. 8d. It appeared from the report of the Official Receiver that he had since his business was wound-up did not sufficiently disclose his business transactions and financial position. He had filed a petition for liquidation by arrangement or composition in June, 1881, when his liabilities were returned at £460 7s. 6d., and his assets at £100. The bankrupt failed to appear at the first meeting of creditors, and his public examination was adjourned.\n\nR. & H. PICKERSGILL.—A meeting of the creditors of Pickersgill, builders and contractors, of Loughborough-road, Brixton, and 2, West Street, Soho, and also of the American Saw-mills, Junction, was held last week, under the presidency of Mr. C. J. Stewart, one of the Assistant Official Receivers. The debtors filed their own petition on the 1st December, and the statement of affairs is thus summarised:—\nThe gross liabilities are estimated at £28,624 2s. 5d., of which amount £4,397 3s. 6d. is expected to rank. The assets amount to £2,484 11s. 5d., from which £147 16s. 7d. has to be deducted for preferential debts. The deficiency is therefore £2,060 8s. 3d. The observations of the Chief Official Receiver are as follows:—The debtors state that in December, 1883, they filed a petition for liquidation, under which it was agreed by the creditors to accept a composition of 10s. in the pound by four equal instalments, the composition to be secured to the satisfaction of the creditors specified, and a trustee was appointed to distribute the composition. The first instalment was paid by the trustee to the majority of the creditors. The debtors failing to meet the second instalment they were called upon by the two creditors and the trustee to execute a deed of assignment to them of their property, which they did in September, 1884. The assignment is stated to have included the stock-in-trade, plant, &c., and book debts, but from the debtors' statement it does not appear that the equities of redemption in the mortgaged properties (the surplus value of which is estimated at £2,397 4s. were comprised in the assignment. The assignment having been made within three months of the commencement of the present proceedings, its validity would appear to be doubtful as against a trustee in bankruptcy. The trustees under the deed of assignment have consented to a sale by the Official Receiver, the proceeds to be placed to a separate account, pending the settlement of the question as to the validity of the deed. The debtors allege that they filed the present petition in order to protect the interests of the new creditors (unsecured) who had supplied materials for the completion of works which had been approved of by the trustees of the deed of assignment, and whom they were not able to pay, in consequence of all their property being in the hands of the trustees. The books which the debtors have kept for the purposes of the business are not such as fully disclose their transactions and financial position; but with the accounts prepared in connection with the former proceedings the present deficiency is explained by them as follows:—Deficiency at December, 1883, being loss on contracts, bad debts, &c., £730 7s. 1d.; expenses of properties, interest, ground rents, &c., £310 8s. 6d.; depreciation in the value of mortgaged properties, £1,116 19s. 6d.; doubtful debts, £18 3s. 10d.; total £2,175 18s. 11d. From this sum is to be deducted the estimated profits of the business since the assignment, viz., £115 10s. 3d., which leaves a total deficiency of £2,060 8s. 3d., which securities held by creditors fully secured are stated to consist of mortgages upon the debtors' various house properties. The estimated surplus of £2,397 4s. included in the assets, is subject to the question of their being included in the assignment as before mentioned. The securities held by creditors partly secured are stated to consist of further mortgages and charges upon certain of the above-mentioned house properties, amounting to £945 15s. 6d.; the assets comprised in the deed of assignment, the value of which is now estimated at £3,129 6s. 4d.; a share in a building society, estimated at £100; and the lease of the debtors' premises, 6 & 7, West Street (7 1/2 years unexpired, at a rental of £115 for the two), estimated at £50. The debtors, on their own application, have been adjudged bankrupt.
