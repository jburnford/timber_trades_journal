THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
GLASGOW.
At this time of the year arrivals of wood goods are always on a small scale, and during the past few weeks they have been extremely light at Clyde ports.
Since the beginning of the year there has been no import of timber at Greenock, and only a small vessel of 338 tons at Port Glasgow (a cargo of lathwood and deals from Riga).
The stock of pitch pine may now be considered as more moderate than it has stood at for several years past, though still ample; a few months ago it was excessive, but there has been no import here for a long time past to augment stock, and a large consumption is always going on.
At Troon Messrs. Brownlee & Co. have received a cargo of pitch pine within the past week for Kilmarnock Saw-mill. This extensive firm import various cargoes of timber and deals to Troon throughout the year for their Kilmarnock branch.
From the report of the Clyde shipbuilding trade for January it appears the total tonnage of the vessels launched during the month was 15,980 tons, which is a very favourable beginning compared with recent years; and it is still more satisfactory to note that the new orders received represent close on 30,000 tons.
The cargo of Tabasco mahogany just landed here, ex Carl Gerhard, is to be sold by auction on Tuesday next, 8th inst., the sale beginning at 11.30 a.m.
It is, perhaps, needless to insert a correction in regard to the following. In last number there was a mistake made in printing what we said as to mahogany then discharging here, making it appear that there were two cargoes being landed of Honduras mahogany. We said one from Laguna (Tabasco mahogany, of course) and one from Belize, Honduras.

LEITH.
During the fourteen days which have elapsed since last regular report the importations of wood have been on the very smallest scale, and have consisted entirely of staves and hoops from New York and Rotterdam respectively and a trifling parcel of lathwood from Riga. Further shipments of deals were expected by the Riga steamer, but room must have been wanting, as none have come to hand. From Hommelvik (Drontheim) by steamer, this week, some sawn goods are looked for, but there is every likelihood of arrivals being limited for some time to come, which is not to be regretted, as the stocks held here are very ample, and demand anything but lively.
Messrs. Park, Dobson, & Co. held a large public sale on the 25th ult., and, as usual at

this firm's sales, the company was exceedingly numerous, the attendance of country buyers, especially, being exceptionally large. Mr. Calder, of Glasgow, acted as broker, and began sharp at the advertised hour. Although there was a great variety of goods advertised, Quebec yellow pine timber and hardwood formed the chief business of the sale. The bidding was slow at first, in spite of the large company, but the exposers had apparently made up their minds to sell, and as soon as the level of prices was fairly established the lots were got through quicker, although at no time was the competition brisk. Besides the recent importation of Quebec goods ex Norway, there was offered a balance of large waney board yellow pine of a previous cargo, which was entirely cleared out. Although the quantity of pine sold was very considerable, but the average of the prices, which ranged from 1s. 8d. to 2s. 5d. per cubic foot, was materially lower than that of the preceding sale for same size of timber. The hardwoods sold fairly well, ash and birch fetching 2s. 3½d. and 1s. 6½d. respectively, and oak 2s. 9d. all per cubic foot; whilst for Austrian wainscot 4s. 3d. was got. There was a variety of deals, battens, floorings of which was placed at satisfactory prices, and it was late before the sale concluded.
On Tuesday, 1st inst., Messrs. Wm. Thomson & Co. held a public sale at the Sands, at which they again offered their cargo of Quebec goods ex Clyde, and the balance of the pine timber ex Crown of India, while. The attendance was not large, and little or no impression was made on the waney board yellow pine, only a few lots being placed at 2s. to 2s. 4½d. per cubic foot. Of the hardwoods also only a lot or two found buyers at 22d. for ash and 18½d. for birch, whilst the elm, which was somewhat weathered, only brought 20d. per cubic foot. A quantity of 3rd quality yellow pine deals ex Ousel × 3 were cleared out at 14d. per cubic foot. The sawn pitch pine was passed, the bids being apparently limited above buyers' ideas. Thereafter the same brokers offered a quantity of Baltic deals and battens, for account of Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, & Co., but the demand for those goods was not active and prices ruled low.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ALCOCK, WILLIAM JAMES, builder and contractor, Aldershot.—At the Guildford County Court, on Thursday, Mr. Keogh, barrister, made an application in this matter. He said the order of adjudication was made on the 3rd, and Mr. David White, of that town, appointed trustee. After some difficulty he was called upon to give an account, and £122 was paid into court. David White had gone into bankruptcy, and he had to apply to the Court for the appointment of a new trustee. His Honour approved the application, and Mr. Clark was to grant a certificate.
ARNOTT, ALEXANDER, builder, Russell road, Holloway, N.—The meeting for public examination in this case (previously reported) was held on Tuesday. The liabilities are £826 12s. 10d., and the assets £19 12s. 1d.; so that there is a deficiency of £807 0s. 9d. The and the Official Receiver states that the deficiency is accounted for by loss on contracts, household and personal expenses in excess of profits, inability to realise book debts, and interest on his borrowed capital. The debtor attributed his failure to want of capital, bad debts, and pressure by creditors. He had been aware of his insolvency since 1884. The examination was ordered to be closed.
Bailey Howlett, builder, 11, St. James's road, Eastwood, Notts.—First meeting, Feb. 11, at 11, at The London and North-Western Hotel, Nottingham. Tucker W. H., Nottingham, Official Receiver.
The Misses Brown, builders, &c., St. Peter's, Thanet.—A first and final dividend of 1s. 6d. in the £ will be payable on Feb. 7, at the office of the Official Receiver, Canterbury.
BROWN, WILLIAM, builder, 32 and 33, Upper Horeb street, Treherbert, Glamorganshire.—In this case the trustee has been released. The gross accounts amounted to £1,059 13s. 1d., and the unsecured liabilities to £1,018 10s. 1d. The assets fully secured realised £401s. 3d. The debtor attributed his failure to bad trade, and having had to sell his business for less than its value.
DOWSETT, GEORGE, builder, 11, St. James's road, Eastwood, Notts.—First meeting, Feb. 11, at 11, at the London and North-Western Hotel, Nottingham. Tucker W. H., Nottingham, Official Receiver.
