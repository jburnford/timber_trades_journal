FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
ALCOCK, WILLIAM JAMES, builder and contractor, Aldershot.—At the Guildford County Court, on Thursday, Mr. Keogh, bar-rister, made an application in this matter. He said the order of adjudication was made on the 3rd, and Mr. David White, of that town, was appointed trustee. After some difficulty he was prevailed upon to give an account, and £122 was paid into court, and was there at present. Since then Mr. David White had gone into bankruptcy, and he had to apply to the Court for the appointment of a new trustee. His Honour decided to grant the application, and Mr. Abbott was appointed trustee.
ALEXANDER, builder, Russell Road, Holloway, N.—The meeting for public examination in this case (previously reported) was held on Wednesday before Mr. Registrar Giffard. The liabilities were returned at £5,533 4s. 10d., and assets £73 12s. 9d. Upon the application of the Official Solicitor, an adjournment was ordered for further accounts.
BASSETT GEORGE, builder, Market, Harborough.—We published a list of the creditors in this case, together with statement of affairs, last week. The first meeting of the creditors was held at the offices of the Official Receiver at Leicester, Mr. J. G. Burgess presiding. The debtor’s liabilities are mostly for building material for the erection of two houses at Market Harborough, the last job apparently he had. To the loss on those houses he attributed his present position. They cost him with the land nearly £2,000, and are mortgaged to the amount of £1,290, whilst the rent for the pair is only £52 a year. The Official Receiver observed that if it was a fact that so much money had been spent on the houses, it would account for the deficiency. A number of receipts were produced by the debtor for money paid away during the last six months, and he alleged that his land at Brampton had been less productive than he calculated, growing only 25 quarters of wheat on 21 acres. There was no offer made on the debtor’s behalf, and the estate was left in the hands of the Official Receiver.
BISHOP, HENRY, of Putney, builder.—The public examination in this matter has just taken place before Mr. Registrar Willoughby and Mr. Cecil Mercer, Official Receiver, of Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W. The receiving order was made on the petition of the debtor himself on the 15th December last, and it now transpired that he was adjudicated on the 11th January. It also transpired that the debtor started with a capital of about £150 some eleven or twelve years ago, and that in 1883 he failed, paying 6s. in the pound. In July last year he again became aware of his critical condition, owing to the losses he sustained on building contracts and his insufficient capital to meet the same. He was also unable to realise his property. The Official Receiver reported that the debtor’s books did not sufficiently disclose his monetary position and business transactions within the three years immediately preceding his bankruptcy, and also that the surplus (£966 12s. 1d.) from securities in the hands of the creditors fully secured was probably very much over-estimated, and he applied for an adjournment, so that the bankrupt might furnish a further and detailed deficiency account. The Registrar being also of opinion that the debtor ought to furnish this fuller account granted the application of the Official Receiver, and the public examination, therefore, now stands adjourned, for the debtor to comply with the order of the Court before he is permitted to pass.
BOULTER, JOS., builder, Staines Road, Hounslow.—The statement of affairs filed in this recent failure shows unsecured debts amounting to £364 19s. 10d., and assets nil. The following are creditors:—
£ s. d.
Beck John Lister, Isleworth … … 66 7 1
Brown & Mecklenburg, Isleworth … 70 2 6

Ridley & Sons, timber merchants, Staines 25 0 9
Smith W., Hounslow Heath … … 13 10 8
BRAGG, HENRY, builder, 8, Strulock Terrace, Parson’s Green, S.W.—A receiving order was made in this case on the 6th inst., and accounts have been furnished showing liabilities, £217 15s. 7d.; debts, fully secured, £820; assets, £20. The debtor, who states that he commenced building in January, 1884, and that he has been out of business since December, 1885, attributes his failure and deficiency mainly to losses in respect of various houses built by him at Fulham, and to his inability to continue building in consequence of his want of capital and the stoppage of his credit in 1885 by the petitioning creditors. The debtor, on his consent, has been adjudged bankrupt. The following are creditors:—
UNSECURED.

The Misses Cayley, Charville Road, Brompton 820 0 0
The debtor made no proposal, and his affairs will be wound up in bankruptcy by the Official Receiver.
BROWN, J. H., builder, 82, Junction Road, Upper Holloway, N.—The receiving order in this case was made on January 19th, and accounts have been furnished showing unsecured liabilities, £443 19s. 6d., and a debt fully secured, £742, with assets, estimated at £401s. 3d. The debtor states that he commenced business fourteen years ago with about £300 capital, and he attributes his failure to the

171
falling off in his business during the last three years, and other causes. He has, on his consent, been adjudged bankrupt.
BUTCHER, J. & N., timber dealers, of near Faversham.—This is an East Kent bankruptcy case. A receiving order has been made against the debtors, who are described by the Official Receiver as timber dealers lately carrying on business at Dunkirk, near Faversham, Kent. Their statement of affairs, which has been filed with the Official Receiver, shows a deficiency of £146 17s. 11d., the assets amounting only to £17 3s. 9d. Mr. George Collard, of Canterbury, is the solicitor in the proceedings. At the public examination, which has just taken place before Mr. Registrar Furley and Mr. Leslie Creery, the debtors were examined as to their financial position and business transactions, especially for the three years prior to the date of the receiving order, and, in answer to the questions addressed to him, Nimrod Butcher stated that he commenced in business with his father in 1880; got into debt with Lord Brabourne for word involved. The other debtor, James Butcher, was also examined by the Official Receiver, and admitted that he was insolvent about twelve or thirteen years ago. Nimrod Butcher said that he knew that some furniture had been taken from his house by his sister to prevent it being seized under an execution; she claimed the goods. The Official Receiver offering no further opposition, the debtors were allowed to pass their public examination.
CURTIS, W. H. H.—At the Poole Bankruptcy Court, recently, before Mr. H. W. Dickinson (Registrar), this debtor, who traded at West Shore, Poole, as a builder, came up for public examination. In reply to the Official Receiver (Mr. A. Dawes) the debtor said he commenced business in 1879 with a capital of £10. The heaviest contract he had undertaken was one for building a pair of villas for £598. Could not say when he became insolvent, as he did not take stock or balance his books. In October, 1886, he paid out an execution for £40, and at that time had several outstanding acceptances. The Official Receiver complained that the debtor had gone on giving charges on property. The Registrar said that the plan of people starting with a capital of £10 or £20, and going in for large speculation, ought to be stopped. The Registrar also censured the debtor for not having disclosed some agreements in his statement of affairs. The estimated deficiency was £277 6s. 6d., but it had been stated that the estate was over-estimated, so that the deficiency might be more. The trustee, with the wish of the committee of inspection, said that the estate had been sold for £400. The examination was adjourned for the debtor to furnish a proper deficiency account. On Wednesday last the debtor came up for further examination. He was unable, he said, to produce a better deficiency sheet, and the Registrar allowed the examination to be closed.
DALY, J. T., timber merchant, York Street Timber Yard, Walworth, S.E.—The bankrupt, described also as of Abbeyville Road, Elms Park Estate, Clapham Road, filed his petition on Wednesday for his order of discharge. The liabilities amounted to £6,663 3s. 4d., of which £2,955 12s. 1d. were expected to rank, and it appeared that the assets had realised £159 17s. 1d., and that a further sum of £50 was expected. The Official Receiver reported that the bankrupt appeared to have commenced business in 1881 with stock valued at £327, taken over from his late employer and since paid for, and £60 borrowed money. He attributed his failure to loss in respect of house property taken over by him under a building agreement, bad debts, and depression in the timber trade. It appeared, however, that the bankrupt had been insolvent since February, 1885, his books then showing a deficiency of £383 17s. 9d., and it was therefore submitted that he had since that date traded with knowledge of insolvency. It was also alleged that he had made certain preferential payments, and that although his books sufficiently disclosed his business transactions, they had not been balanced since February, 1885. In July, 1885, the bankrupt jointly with another person (since adjudicated bankrupt) took over an undertaking for the building of certain houses at Streatham, and the Official Receiver contended that this undertaking was a rash and hazardous one, having regard to the bankrupt's financial position at that time. It was stated that the transaction had resulted in a loss of £300). Mr. H. Reed, for the trustee, and Mr Aldridge, for S. Woolf opposed.
