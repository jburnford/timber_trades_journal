The master and crew were landed at Barcelona on the 3rd inst.\n\nTHE STRANDING OF THE “TROQUEER.”\n—The official inquiry, which was held on Monday last, into the stranding of this steamer, which occurred off Gefle while she was proceeding from Hudikswall to Suttonbridge, with a cargo of deals, battens, and boards, resulted in the Court pronouncing that the master was not justified in going to sea with a deck cargo unsecured, and with the vessel having a list to starboard. The court steered were not safe and proper, and when the breakers were observed the vessel should have retraced her course. The Court was, therefore, of opinion that the vessel was not navigated with proper and seamanlike care. The master was entirely to blame for the casualty, and neither the chief nor second officers were to blame.\n\nIMPORTS.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
