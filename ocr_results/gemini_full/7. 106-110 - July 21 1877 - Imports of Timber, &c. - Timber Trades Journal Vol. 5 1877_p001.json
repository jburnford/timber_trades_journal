MITCHELL, SOMERVILLE and Co. offered for sale on the 17th the yellow pine ex *Impératrice*, from Quebec.\nThe weather was very unfavourable, consequently the buyers at the commencement of the sale were very few, but latterly there was a fair attendance.\nWaney pine fetched 2s. 3½d., 2s. 5½d., 2s. 7d., 2s. 10d., 3s.\nSquare ditto 2s. 2d., 2s. 3½d.\n3rd quality yellow pine deals, 1s. 3d.\nCrown Riga red 7 x 2½ 11½d.\nDo.

Thomson and Co. exposed for sale to-day the balance of Minatitlan mahogany, ex *Assyria*, consisting of 83 logs.\nThere was a very meagre attendance of buyers, and the auctioneer appeared tied to a price which was not obtainable, there being little competition.\nPrices ranged from 4½d. to 5d., and 6d. to 6½d.: the entire quantity did not find buyers.\n\nDUNDEE.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nJuly 18th, 1877.\nArrivals are getting more numerous now, and trade is fairly good in the meantime.\nAt a sale at Victoria Dock Saw Mills yesterday, a large quantity of yellow pine ex *Hollinside*, @ Quebec, was disposed of.\nBoardwood realized from 2s. 4d. to 3s., averaging over 2s. 8d.; other woods also sold well.\n\nCARDIFF.\n(From Messrs. Tellefsen, Wiehe, & Co.'s Circular, July 15th.)\nThe supply of wood during the month of June being about equal to the requirements of this district, we have no change to report in prices.\nOnly two cargoes of Norwegian mining timber have arrived here during the month.\nStocks in port are light.\nThe quantities expected to arrive this season are comparatively small, so that the slightest improvement in trade in the Staffordshire district will probably cause prices to advance considerably.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From July 4th to July 18th.\nHewn Timber (loads).\nRussia—9,394 Burt & Co.\n{ 3,200 Gabriel & Sons.\n667 P.
