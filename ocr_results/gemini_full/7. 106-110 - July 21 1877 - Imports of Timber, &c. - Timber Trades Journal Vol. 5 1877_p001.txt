Messrs. MITCHELL, SOMERVILLE and Co. offered for sale on the 17th the yellow pine ex *Impératrice*, from Quebec.

Messrs. W. Thomson and Co. exposed for sale to-day the balance of Minatitlan mahogany, ex *Assyria*, consisting of 83 logs.
There was a very meagre attendance of buyers, and the auctioneer appeared tied to a price which was not obtainable, there being little competition.
Prices ranged from 4½d. to 5d., and 6d. to 6½d.: the entire quantity did not find buyers.

DUNDEE.
(From our own Correspondent.)
July 18th, 1877.
Arrivals are getting more numerous now, and trade is fairly good in the meantime.
At a sale at Victoria Dock Saw Mills yesterday, a large quantity of yellow pine ex *Hollinside*, @ Quebec, was disposed of.
Boardwood realized from 2s. 4d. to 3s., averaging over 2s. 8d.; other woods also sold well.

CARDIFF.
(From Messrs. Tellefsen, Wiehe, & Co.'s Circular, July 15th.)
The supply of wood during the month of June being about equal to the requirements of this district, we have no change to report in prices.
Only two cargoes of Norwegian mining timber have arrived here during the month.
Stocks in port are light.
The quantities expected to arrive this season are comparatively small, so that the slightest improvement in trade in the Staffordshire district will probably cause prices to advance considerably.
