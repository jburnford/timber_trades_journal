NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," June 30th.)
The basis for an interesting report upon the lumber market continues very small, and our weekly search after information brings unsatisfactory results, so far as obtaining really new features is concerned. Business generally lacks spirit both in a wholesale and retail way, and even where dealers are to be found whose distribution of supplies foots up fairly, there is a complaint of very diminutive margins or of no profit at all. The local consumption for both manufacturing and building purposes has proven smaller thus far than expected on the early season, and the incoming month is not one which ordinarily brings much animation, but rather to the contrary, while domestic shipping orders amount to virtually nothing. The export outlet, however, is kept open for certain grades, and this to some extent is a saving clause on the market which prevents a more general stagnation. Another feature for congratulation is the absence as yet of any very heavy accumulation, yellow pine being about the only style upon which receivers have been placed in a position where it became necessary to either "slaughter" the price or lay the stock away and take chances for the future. There is, however, more goods coming forward from the interior, and it is likely that a few weeks will find stocks commencing to pile up somewhat.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," June 20th.)
Trade has been so uniformly quiet all through the present spring that it has been next to impossible to find anything fresh in the way of information for a readable trade report from week to week. There is no activity now, none has been experienced for some time past, and operators are simply looking forward in the hope that future developments may prove more propitious for sales and profits.
By the reports we find that though the total shipments for the season are some 20,000,000 short of last year, the amount for June is a trifle in advance, and if the kind of stock called for were on dock a middling fair trade might be enjoyed forward to the time when their new cut will be about a fortnight hence, when more animation is expected on the market.
The late heavy rains were very extensive throughout the north-west, and a new phase is now being placed upon the probable supply question. While it is not probable that the full cut will be run out, the chances now look more favourable for securing a fair per-centage from most of the main streams, and a good many logs from the smaller tributaries will in all probability be worked down. Hundreds of men have been put upon the drives, and much now depends upon how long the head holds out, which is liable to be of short duration at this time of year, but we will be able to report on results more decisively another week.
The Rifle, Au Gres, Tittabawassee, Au Sable, and their tributaries, are satisfactory, while the remaining streams on this side promise a fair drive. Most of the Menominee, Oconto, Peshtigo, and Ford River cuts will be secured. Wolf, Chippew, Black, Wisconsin, and the upper Minnesota streams look more hopeful, and will yield a larger per-centage of the cut than was at first supposed.

ALBANY.
(From the "Albany Argus," July 3rd and June 26th.)
There has been a fair business in the district since our last report covering some round lots common box suitable for shipping and for box makers. The attendance of buyers seeking such stock has been larger than usual. The proposed reduction in rail freights on lumber from the mills to the seaboard will not help matters here. We have not any change of moment to make in quotations.
It is estimated by receivers that there will be a shortage of fifty to sixty per cent. in the receipts of Canadian lumber, but that this deficit will be made up by the receipts from Michigan.
The Michigan papers do not talk as confident as they did a week or ten days ago, that all the logs would reach the mills; their language now is that they will secure a fair per-centage thereof.
In regard to Wisconsin logging, the talk is that the lumbermen are all down in the mouth on account of the failure of the log drives. The Chippewa river was falling fast and but few logs arriving. Not to exceed five per cent. of last winter's cut will be got to the mills.

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL.
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman and Manufacturer," June 28th.)
The situation for the managed as the probable supply of lumber for the season's business. The estimate of the Lumberman remains unchanged so far as relates to the probable per-centage of the logs that will hardly be reached on the Mississippi waters, the late rains not having released so heavy a per-centage of the logs as was anticipated. Our readers will remember the figures which we set down, showing that the amount of logs could not reach much over 50 per cent. of last year's crop, and we have not the slightest reason to change our estimate by increasing, but all news tends to show that the total crop of new logs secured on the river will not exceed 40 per cent. of last year's drives, if it reaches that figure. Definite and reliable information from the St. Croix says that they will secure half the logs cut last winter and no more, or about 65,000,000 against 200,000,000 last year. On the upper Mississippi and Rum some uncertainty as to a part of the drives still exists, but we find no one who sets the amount down at much over half of last year's crop, with large probability that it may run under.

[JULY 21, 1877.
The Wisconsin is made to feel "the certainty 'twixt the cup and the lip," for notwithstanding that "there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip," for it appears that the water has fallen as rapidly as it rose, and few logs are out or will be got out without large expense and much hard labour, and then only a very limited supply. On the Black River the reports seem to grow more and more discouraging daily. Only a few logs have reached the booms at the mouth, and they daily cannot be moved without an 18-inch rise, while the main drives are still far up the river, almost hung up. On the Chippewa the situation has not improved, and the chances for a drive of one-half the cut of the river seem to grow less and less. But very few logs have been driven to the mills or slough.
