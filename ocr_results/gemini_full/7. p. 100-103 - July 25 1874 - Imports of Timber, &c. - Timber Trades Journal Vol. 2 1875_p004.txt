AN AMERICAN VIEW OF THE PROPOSED RECIPROCITY TREATY.—
The Lumberman's Gazette, commenting unfavourably on the proposed Reciprocity Treaty with Canada, and its effect on the lumber trade of the Western States, says :—The duty on sawed pine lumber is now $2 per M. If, as free traders say, the value of the home products is increased by just the amount of duty on the foreign article, we must take exactly $2 from the price of lumber when reciprocity is again arranged with Canada. The selling price of our lumber has been quoted this year pretty uniformly at $6 and $12. Sales above those figures in this market have been of special qualities. Take $2 from those prices, and the result is plain to every lumberman. It becomes then not a question of profits with the manufacturer, for lumber cannot be sold at such prices. There is lumber now on the docks of the Saginaw river which has cost the manufacturer $5.50 ; nor has it been possible to avoid this, because of the long investment by reason of the hanging up of logs from year to year.
If what has been said above be true, we find as follows concerning the proposed reciprocity scheme :—1st. We are already enjoying under the Treaty of Washington those reciprocal rights and privileges which are unquestionably in our favour. 2nd. Reciprocity, as it was under the old treaty and as is now proposed, means simply the furnishing of a market for Canadian products without getting in return a market for our manufacturers, thereby leaving the balance of trade against us in a yearly increasing ratio. 3rd. We should put a ruinous discouragement upon one of our greatest industries—the lumber trade —while the country at large would be brought into debt thereby every year.

Timber Trade Reports.
LONDON.
July 24th, 1874.
There has been more inquiry for deals, &c., lately, and though there is very little variation in the state of the market to be recorded, what there is so far is rather favourable than otherwise. This slight improvement must be reassuring to those who have been of opinion that some calamitous monetary crisis was to be the turning-point of the present stagnation, for there are no indications to warrant us in assuming even the probability of such an event. Indeed the fact that recently two or three failures have occurred in different parts of the kingdom without any prejudicial effect on the general tone of the market, strengthens our belief that the turning-point of a very critical season has arrived. Indeed the slight reaction we assumed arises from the fact that when previous market quotations are tried, which indicates that either buyers are found ready enough, or that stocks are running low, or that there is an under current of speculation somewhere, and a revival of confidence is likely to set in.
It is true there are some sorts of wood that still show a decline in price, but this seems to be more the result of the action of the shippers abroad at the ports where this decline is so apparent, than the effect of the market here, for in expectation of full supplies towards next season they are anxious to clear off the surplus of this year's rather heavy stocks before the present season closes as best they may, to make room for next year's supplies.
The fact of the closing prices showing a decline is no guarantee that the coming season's stocks will figure equally low—rather the other way; besides, it is only to a certain class of goods that these remarks apply, as we believe on the Swedish side the prices for most of the brands have been well sustained, while at the present time some kinds are held firm at previous rates. The decline to which we allude is most apparent on Baltic timber (without including in our remarks pitch pine, all along a most unprofitable commodity), which to the importer, selling at a loss before is still forced on the market at a further reduction of 2s. or so per load).
On the previous month's quotations for east country timber we may give the average decline at about 1s. to 2s. per cubic load, a rather serious reduction had the trade kept brisk, but under existing circumstances carries nothing alarming with it, and is we believe entirely attributable to the causes stated.
The price of foreign prepared flooring boards still keeps pretty steady, and battens from Norway of fair average quality maintain their ground, and for which there is still a good demand among some of the large mill-owners on this side, especially for 7 in. wood. There can be no doubt that the stock of good battens shipped to this country from Norway has fallen off considerably; and just now that there appears some likelihood of the price of English labour being easier, so that our saw-mill proprietors can possibly compete in the manufacture of this class of wood, the inquiry for good battens is on the increase, hence the firmness in price of the very limited quantity that are now offering. At one time the trade in battens with Norway was enormous, but now it is almost useless asking for any large quantity of wood that is fit for converting, as it is mostly that what we call second quality, and what would a few years ago have been but indifferent thirds. A batten of rubbish comes to England, and anything is sawn into flooring that is good for on the spot, and fetches a much better price that way besides, the large mill-owners out there cannot afford to let the machinery stand idle; hence it is obvious that we must not expect the old class of batten without paying almost the same price as we would for deals if we can get them at all, which is very doubtful. Sawn quarterings are offering now freely, but mostly under, and of very indifferent quality.
Freights are likely to be stiffer than our previous quotations, and though we cannot make any material variation in our last list of prices as the rates are much the same as before, still a change is evident by the charters recently effected being at the full quoted prices. It is generally the case that towards the fall of the year freights have an upward tendency, and the present inclination reminds us that the most favourable time for chartering has passed.
