July 21st, 1875.\n\nImportations of American timber and deals—chiefly Quebec—into the Clyde during the last few days have been on a pretty extensive scale. As will be seen from the list, these cargoes comprise all the various assortments of wood, hard and soft, suitable for every description of work. No doubt much has been shipped with a view to the requirements of shipbuilders, who form a very large part of our consumptive power here; and although as mentioned in my last letter they have comparatively few vessels in progress at present, it is hoped as building material is much reduced in price, and fresh openings in commerce looked for, that they may very soon resume their wonted activity. Meantime it must be owned sales of American wood are very difficult to effect.\nAt a public sale of a large cargo of Miramichi spruce and pine deals held here on the 7th inst., at Yorkhill Timber Wharf, there was a good attendance, but little spirited competition, and the under-mentioned rates realized:—the spruce deals were nearly all disposed of @ £6 17s. 6d. to £8 2s. 6d. per St. Petersburg standard. A few lots of the pine, best sizes, brought from £7 11s. to £8 5s.\nAnother public sale of St. John spruce deals was called on the 14th inst. The attendance was small and little business done, being about the beginning of the annual summer holiday here.\nA public sale is announced of a cargo of Tabasco mahogany, to take place here on Tuesday, the 27th inst., Singleton, Dunn, & Co., agents.\n\nLEITH.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nJuly 21st, 1875.\n\nThe arrivals the last fourteen days have been very numerous, say 71. Of these 25 are of Baltic timber, 8 oak and fir staves, 1 wood pulp, and the remainder various. Against 52 same date last season.\nMessrs. Ferguson, Davidson, &c. exposed for sale on the 13th the entire cargo of the Algiers from Quebec, being the first of this season. The attendance was very large, and the whole of the pine was cleared off at very fair prices. The hardwood, however, had few buyers.\nMessrs. W. Thomson and Co. had a sale of deals and battens on the 15th; the prices obtained were very low.\nMessrs. Mitchell, Somerville, & Co. exposed for sale yesterday their cargo ex \"Adriatic,\" from Quebec. The attendance was good and the buyers numerous, but the prices did not come up to the expectation of the exposers. The demand for hardwood was very limited.\nSales announced.—On the 27th, Messrs. James Duncan & Co., in their yard, Assembly Street, deals, battens, &c.; and August 3rd, Messrs. William Thomson & Co., at the Sands, Constitution Street, the entire cargo of the \"Annie Laurie\" from Quebec.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—July 9th to July 1st.\n\nTimber, Deals, &c.—Odessa (s) @ Cronstadt,—415 pcs. oars, J.
