Sixty-eight pieces of brown fir timber, 7 feet long and 9½ inches square, and marked “W. K.” were picked up afloat off the Admiralty buoy, about 6th July.\nWEXFORD, 15th July.—The Theodor, from Memel with timber, has driven ashore in South bay.\nNEWHAVEN, 16th July.—The Soblomsten, from Skonvik, with wood, got on the West bank, in entering the harbour, last night, and fell over and filled with water this morning, on the tide rising.\nGREAT YARMOUTH, 18th July.—The Fanny, of Frederikstadt, from Sundswall to Littlehampton, with timber and deals, struck upon the Owers sand, and unshipped rudder; she came off making water, took assistance of fishermen, and was assisted into harbour this morning by steam-tug.\nST. THOMAS, 19th July.—The J. L. Wickwire, from Doboy to Shields, with lumber, has put in here waterlogged, with loss of sails and maintopmast.\nGRANGEMOUTH, 21st July.—The Carl, of Langesund, which arrived here this morning from that port, with timber, caught the ground outside the dock-gates, listed over when the tide left, and has filled with water this tide; arrangements have been made to commence discharging her.\nGOTHENBURG, 21st July.—The Dutch kuff Minkiena, from Riga to Bo’ness with sleepers, has put in leaky, having been aground at Nidingen.\nQUEBEC, 9th July.—A quantity of square timber was passed adrift between Magdalen Island and Gaspe, by the Alhambra (s), which arrived here, 3rd July, from Pictou.\nST. JOHN, N.B., 3rd July.—Our freight market has been rather quiet during the week, without any quotable change in rates. We hear of the following deal charters:—San Carlos, 412, Liverpool, 77s. 6d.; Anna Lindsley, 217, and George Henry, 421, both for Dublin, at 75s.; St. Olaveis, 672, Bristol Channel, 75s.; Peri, 250, Conway, 77s. 6d.; Reaper, 349, Drogheda, 75s.; Mabel, 359, Sligo, 73s. 9d.; Johnny Smith,—, East Coast Ireland, 75s.; S. B. Hume, 353, Point Wolf to Ireland, 75s.\nQUEBEC FREIGHTS, July 9th.—Brrivals are but few, and but little is doing in chartering. The freight market has recovered from the depressed state it was inclined to take last week. The inquiry for tonnage is better, and an advance on late transactions will probably be obtained. The advance in oil, grain, deals, and lumber freights from other points is absorbing tonnage that would otherwise proceed here, and at present there is no reason to think that the fall short in tonnage up, or that arrivals of seeking tonnage will be large enough to cause a decline in rates of freight. A comparative statement of arrivals and tonnage shows 190 vessels, 142,249 tons less than at this date last year. Quotations are—London, 35s. oak, 32s. 6d. pine, 82s. 6d. deals; Liverpool, 33s. large proportion hardwood; Dover, 34s. and 80s.; Greenock, 29s. 6d. nominal; Dublin, 31s. timber, 82s. 6d. deals; E. C. Ireland, 31s. 6d. timber, 82s. 6d. deals; Gloucester, 90s. deals and ends.\nDISASTERS IN JUNE.—The number of vessels belonging to, or bound to or from ports in the United States reported totally lost and missing during the past month is 23—of which 16 were wrecked, 2 abandoned, 3 burned, 1 sunk by collision, and 1 missing. They are classed as follows:—3 ships, 3 barks, 1 brig, and 16 schooners, and their total value, exclusive of cargoes, is estimated at 400,000 dols.—N. Y.

Giles and Giles was heard. The plaintiff, described as a timber agent, sought to recover the sum of £9 13s., being the amount of commission on a quantity of beech and walnut sold to the defendants. The plaintiff stated that he inquired of the defendants if they could do with the timber in question, and was told that they could find a customer, which they eventually did, and he now sought to recover his commission at the rate of five per cent. In answer to the learned judge whether that was the customary charge, plaintiff called W. Parslowe and C. Gibbons, two timber agents, who stated the charge was usually acknowledged by the trade; this being the plaintiff's case. Mr. John Brinsmead, pianoforte manufacturer, stated that he purchased the timber from the defendants and paid 1s. 9d. per foot for it, and never employed an agent to purchase the timber. He knew the plaintiff as a timber agent, but had no transactions with him in the matter. The defence denied buying the timber from the plaintiff, who only told them where was some timber of the description they wanted. This they bought from the vender direct without any intervention of the plaintiff. The judge, taking the defendants' view of the case, non-suited the plaintiff, allowing defendants' costs.\n\nConsumption of Timber in America.\nTHE consumption of timber throughout the United States is enormous, more especially in the mining districts. To meet the wants of the western miners a method of conveyance has not long since been invented which is said to be equally simple, economical, and efficient. An aqueduct, called a \"flume,\" of triangular shape, six feet wide at the top and some three deep at the centre, connects the forest with the mine. It requires but slight water pressure, and can be constructed so as to follow the natural inclinations or sinuosities of the district or valley along which it may be carried. A guardian is stationed at about every second mile's distance along it, and should he observe any cessation of the passage of timber along the flume his office is to proceed to the spot where the obstruction may occur, and to remove it; but although many of these flumes have been in operation during the last two or three years, some of them of a length of fifty miles, blocks very seldom occur in the passage of timber along them, and they likewise afford the means of transit for foresters, who seat themselves on the floating piles of wood.\nAs one example amongst any number that might be cited of the enormous quantities in which wood is called for in the western States, it may be mentioned that there is on the Union and Pacific Railway in Nevada a huge artificial snow-shed or tunnel, constructed entirely of piles and planks of timber, which it requires an hour and twenty minutes to traverse, and which is said to be twenty-nine miles in length.\nMost of the rolling stock of the railways in the United States, as well as most of the bridges, are constructed of pitch pine. In an ordinary business year from 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 feet of this wood are needed to repair the annual destruction, but last year this trade was almost suspended, owing to the necessity for economy which was created by the panic. Shippers were thus heavy losers, owing to the glut in the market from accumulated stock.\nHENRY DISSTON & SONS, the Philadelphia saw manufacturers, are not only sending saws to England, but are, we understand, opening markets in Russia and Spain.—Lumberman's Gazette.\nTHE Electrical News is the title of a new monthly scientific magazine, which under the guidance of Mr. William Crookes, Editor of the Quarterly Journal of Science, will no doubt perform a useful work amongst students of electricity.\nMR. S. J. CLAY, of Derby, constructor of railway rolling stock, has purchased several acres of land near the works of the Darlington Iron Company, with a view of erecting works similar to those already in operation at Derby and Barrow-in-Furness, for the building of railway waggons and rolling stock.",
