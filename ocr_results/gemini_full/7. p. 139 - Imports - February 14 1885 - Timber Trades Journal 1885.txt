WASHED AWAY.—The inner wall of the Harbour, at Jersey, was washed away by the high tide, and is consequently unsafe for shipping.

GRATEFUL AND COMFORTING.—By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors’ bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.—*Civil Service Gazette*.—Made simply with boiling water or milk. Sold only in Packets, labelled:—“JAMES EPPS & Co., Homœopathic Chemists, London.”

JOHN HISCOCK.—At the Brighton County Court, on Friday, the 6th inst., an application was made by the debtor, who formerly traded as a builder and publican at Brighton, for his discharge, which was opposed by the Official Receiver, on the ground of the debtor’s extravagance. The Judge, after hearing both sides, granted the debtor unconditional discharge. We understand that the decision will be appealed against.
