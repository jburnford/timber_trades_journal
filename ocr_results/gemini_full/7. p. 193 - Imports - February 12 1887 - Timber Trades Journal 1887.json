The shipment was by Mr. Lewis Miller, and seemed a very excellent one in every respect.\nTrade keeps extremely quiet, and although there have been a number of the London agents here this week, they have not succeeded in making many contracts in this district.\nThe expected clearance of the consignment of sawn pitch pine ex Crown of India, from Mobile, has at last taken place, one of the importers here having taken up the entire balance of fully 20,000 ft. at a fraction under the limit for which the wood had been previously held. This will have the effect of improving the value here of sawn pitch pine, and, as it is dearer to import, the excessively low prices touched during recent months will not likely be repeated.\nThere was no public sale at the docks this week, but Messrs. Ferguson, Davidson, & Co. offered on Tuesday, 8th inst., at the Imperial Saw-mills a quantity of cut yellow pine boards. There was, unfortunately, but a small attendance of buyers, and the bulk of the wood had to be passes for want of competition. Prices ruled low.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
