Last fortnight there have been eight arrivals of this wood at Greenock.\nIn reference to the timber market here, little animation or eagerness to purchase beyond present requirements has been shown of late, and last fortnight's business has not indicated any improvement in this respect, although it must be owned a large consumption of wood is going on, and moderate demand for most classes of goods continues with little alteration in prices generally.\nIt is encouraging to note, however, that at the last sitting of the Dean of Guild Court here applications were made from about fifty parties for building, to the extent of about £200,000. Should the erection of these properties and the shipbuilding now in progress proceed without interruption, in all likelihood there will be a steady demand for timber, and not much probability of a falling price.\nGreenock shipowners are now busy getting their vessels fitted up, but the action taken by the Board of Trade officers in compelling extensive repairs to be made on vessels at this particular time, is said to be causing considerable dissatisfaction, and the more so as some vessels will be practically stopped, and likely to lose at least one voyage this summer.\n\nLEITH.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nMarch 28th, 1877.\nMy returns for last fortnight will show 28 arrivals. These consist of 12 cargoes battens, 13 cargoes pit props, 2 parcels birch and oak staves, 1 cargo pitch pine. The easterly winds which have been prevalent here for several days have no doubt sent these vessels into our Firth sooner than anticipated; battens not being much in demand, but pit props can always find a market.\nOne of our Quebec traders sailed last week, and other two will leave to-morrow.\nFreights are rather dull. Tonnage is, however, wanted. Gefle, Soderhamn, Sundswall, Bjorneberg, Ljusne, for Leith and Grangemouth. Riga to Bo'ness. Square sleepers 14s. is offered.\nMessrs. Mitchell, Thomson and Co. exposed for sale at Granton, yesterday, cut timber, deals, &c. The weather was very unfavourable, wind and rain prevailing the whole time. Notwithstanding, there was a good turn out of buyers, and about 65 lots pine boards were disposed of at prices varying from 2d. to 3d. per foot.\nA small parcel birch brought 2s.\nRiga wainscot, ash, and pitch pine not wanted.\nPetersburg crown red deals 11x3 6d. 1-8th.\n\" \" \" \" 9x3 5d.\n\" \" \" \" 7x3 3d.\n\" \" \" \" 7x2½ 2d. 3-16ths.\n\" \" white \" 7x2½ 2d.\n\" \" \" \" 11x3 3d. 14-16ths.\nSeveral lots flooring were sold at 14½d. (1st 2½d.). In consequence of there being little competition, the exposers did not continue the sale longer than 2.30.\nMessrs. W. Thomson and Co. will offer for sale at the Sands on the 3rd prox., American pine, Swedish pine, deals and &c.\nMitchell, Somerville, and Co., deals and battens on the 10th.\nHutchison and Rogers, American pine, &c., on the 17th.\nThomson, Nephews, and Co., at South Alloa, on the 24th.\n\nCARDIFF.\n(From Messrs. Tellefsen, Wills, and Co.'s Circular, March 15.)\nWe have very little change to report in the pitwood trade since our last issue. In the former part of the month the market was very dull, but towards the close there was a somewhat brisker demand. Arrivals have been rather more regular, and prices remain much the same as in the latter part of January—prices not having fallen as much as was anticipated when the sudden decline took place at the beginning of the year.\n\nDUNDEE.\n(From our own Correspondent.)\nMarch 28th, 1877.\nThere is little of interest to report here since my last communication. Trade, which at this season generally takes a start for the year, is still\n\nvery lifeless, and prospects are not nearly so bright as last year. Auction sales are still as frequent (once a week or even oftener), and this, combined with the languid demand, makes prices positively unremunerative to the seller.\nThere has been some commotion caused by the rumour of the removal of the old-established business of William Kirkland and Son, Dundee Saw Mills, to Tayport. The present site of their works (adjacent to the post office) is certainly a very valuable one, variously put as worth from £50,000 to £90,000, and ground at Tayport with many privileges being obtainable at a trifling cost, the rumour may prove a true, as it is certainly a likely enough, one, although it will probably be some time ere it be an accomplished fact.\nThe returns of timber imports into Montrose have now been published for 1876, and are as follows :—\nTotal number of loads of timber and deals established\nFor 1875 ... ... ... 35,671\nFor 1876 ... ... ... 31,287\nIncrease ... ...\nThe whole of the above import, with the exception of one small cargo, was for Robert Millar and Sons, and consisted chiefly of deals and battens from Gulf ports for conversion into flooring and match-boarding to be shipped to London and the colonies, as well as over all Scotland principally northwards.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From March 15th to March 28th.\nHewn Timber (loads).\nPrussia—637 Burt & Co.\n85 P.
