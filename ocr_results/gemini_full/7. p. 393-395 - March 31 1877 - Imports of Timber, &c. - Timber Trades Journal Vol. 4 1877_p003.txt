The Quebec Spring Fleet.
The "timberman" cleared this season from the Clyde is the City of Montreal, belonging to Messrs. Allan, of Glasgow. On Thursday the Roseneath sailed for Halifax, N.S., with a general cargo. Seamen are rather scarce at the lower ports, but at Greenock one crew at least has been shipped at £4 per month, with £3 advance. The rate is said to be ruling 5s. per month higher for ships, and however, many crews from Shetland are usually engaged for the two summer voyages. It is thought the number this year may not be so great as formerly, many men having gone to the seal fishing, but it is not anticipated there will be any scarcity of seamen to man the fleet. Shipowners are now busy getting their vessels fitted up, but the action taken by the Board of Trade officers in compelling extensive repairs to be made on vessels at this particular time, especially when the ships have been laid up in the harbours all winter, is said to be causing considerable dissatisfaction and annoyance. In one or two cases where vessels were being prepared for their annual outfit the Board of Trade officers, it is alleged, have declared certain extensive alterations and repairs to be necessary ere they can proceed. Two vessels at least have been practically stopped, and their rudders taken off, while the alterations declared to be necessary on one or two other vessels is likely to cause them to lose at least one voyage this summer. Of course all this is causing a good deal of heart-burning, and united action is spoken of among shipowners to make a representation to head-quarters on the subject. It is argued that since last fall the ships have been lying idle, and that intimation ought to have been given ere this time of the necessity to proceed with alterations and repairs beyond the ordinary annual requirements of a vessel. Compared with bygone years the character of vessel now required for carrying timber is so much improved, and the cost of up-keep so greatly increased, together with the high rates of insurance and low freights, that in many cases the greatest prudence has to be exercised to get accounts to square at the end of the season, and in one or two instances it has transpired that the balance was on the wrong side. It is therefore little to be wondered at when the Government officials step in at the last moment, so to speak, and insist upon extensive and expensive alterations being made, that owners grumble and complain, especially when they see the prospect of a voyage being lost ere the repairs can be executed.

OAK STAVES.—The exportation of oak staves from Trieste during the month of February was 2,495,573 pieces, of which 290,305 were sent to this country. The shipments, with the exception of 10,000 to Liverpool, were all to London.
DARIEN.—During the twelve months from January 1st, 1876, to January 1st, 1877, 56,636,716 ft. timber and 11,237,865 ft. lumber were shipped from Darien, Georgia, U.S. Of this quantity by far the greater portion—44,928,735 ft. timber and 2,197,600 ft. lumber came to this country—about 15 per cent. going to Liverpool. The largest shippers were Messrs. Dobell and Co., who despatched 61 vessels, containing 20,717,112 ft. timber and 1,239,079 ft. lumber. The other shippers were Messrs. D. M. Munro; Young and Langdon; Hiltons and Foster; Guy, Stewart, and Co; A. Schmidt; and Epping, Baars, and Co.
TREES FOR LONDON STREETS.—According to the experience of Mr. W. W. Paul, nurseryman, there are four trees which thrive better than others in towns: these are the plane (Platanus occidentalis), the poplar (Populus monilifera), the elm (Ulmus campestris), and the gigantic stag's-horn sumach (Ailanthus glandulosus). The latter, though but little known, is a very beautiful tree, from the north of China, growing to the height of 50 feet, with large handsome pinnate leaves, which, on the young trees, are often a yard long. The lime (Tilia Europæa), when it will grow, is one of the best of town trees, because it may be pruned into any shape required without injury, and the flowers are very sweet. —Builder.
LOSSES AT SEA.—The number of casualties posted on "Lloyd's Loss Book for 1876" was 2,539, as compared with 2,553 the previous year; portion of steamers to sailing vessels being slightly less in the latter year.

American Intelligence.
NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," March 17th.)
There is no decided change on the general market for wholesale parcels. In some cases we hear expressions of disappointment, especially where rather sanguine expectations of a free export demand had been entertained; but, take it all in all, the movement is fair, and the chances more in favour of an increase than a falling off behind. In values, however, the prospects for an increase do not seem to be remarkably encouraging, recent trials for a higher range having shown that buyers retain all the old caution, and not only resist full cost, but fail to operate beyond their most positive wants. Very little interest of a decided character appears to be manifested regarding supplies to come, and our dealers are unwilling to believe that with the winter just passed there can be an actual shortage of logs.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," March 7th.)
The weather now begins to look more favourable for logging than it has at any time during the past six weeks, and, in fact, we have already had from two to three inches of snow in this part, which has made sledging considerably better than it was previous to the fall. Upon the Rifle very fair work is now being done, and there is a probability of the crop reaching from 60,000,000 to 65,000,000 at least calculations. Along the Au Gres, Au Sable, Chippewa, Bad, Pine and other streams, operations have quickened, though there is not yet snow enough for comfortable hauling. But the elements look propitious, and the cold raw winds indicate that a storm is brewing, and men with active teams are all in trim to strike for the camps at a moment's warning, so that if there shall chance to come a couple of weeks of salubrious roading we may reasonably expect a considerable swelling in the banking account of this Valley and State. But few sales of logs have yet been made, and they were at an advance of about fifty cents over rates ruling one year ago. Buyers, however, are confident that there will soon be a weakening in prices, as stocks in many cases are held on speculation until the outcome of the season is more fully determined. A week or ten days at least will be required before it can be definitely determined how large a stock can be relied upon for 1877.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," March 8th.)
There has been a fair demand for lumber for shipment to country yards, and the transactions show a slight increase over those of last week. Some of the dealers, however, assert that their orders have shown a perceptible falling off within the last two or three days. The only reason they assign is that of the bad weather which has prevailed for a week or ten days past. Inasmuch as storms of rain or snow are generally effectual in retarding the movement of lumber over country roads, it seems reasonable to presume that this cause is responsible, in part at least, for the reduced sales; and as soon as the weather improves and the roads get better it may be expected that the lumber trade in the interior will also revive again.

MONTREAL.
(From the "Montreal Journal of Commerce.")
The aspects of the lumber trade are scarcely encouraging. The old stocks held in Montreal, however, are getting reduced, and there is one-third less on hand than at this time last year. About twenty-five small yards have been given up, and as many more will be given up to the owners in May next. The profits of these extra yards have not paid rent and salary of a salesman to attend them. We have fifty-four lumber dealers in Montreal, nineteen of whom own saw or planing mills. They occupy one hundred and ten yards, and have on hand at present 40,000,000 feet of lumber, which is sufficient to do next year's business with the usual assortment. Formerly we had five to six million feet of lumber wintered over for the South American market. To-day we have not a pile of it on hand. Five or six firms having large stocks have taken the benefit of the Bankrupt Act, and promised to pay 30 to 60 cents on the dollar. For the last eighteen months they have been selling at less than could have been bought for at Quebec or Ottawa, and obliged small operators who are striving to pay one hundred cents on the dollar, to sell at figures which gave them no profit. This slaughtering of stocks is nearly at an end, as they have got rid of the excessive quantity, and it may be one hundred years before some of our lumber dealers will again boast in their advertisements of having thirty-six million feet of lumber on hand and seventeen yards.

DARIEN.
(From the "Darien Gazette," March 8th.)
Our market passed through the last week quietly, figures remaining about the same as they have been for several weeks past. Although there is no anxiety shown on the part of the buyers, arrivals continue.
