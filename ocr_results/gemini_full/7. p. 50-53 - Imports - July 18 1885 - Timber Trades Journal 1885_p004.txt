This failure has been reported.—This failure has been for his adjourned examination at the Bankruptcy Court before the Registrar (Mr. A. O. Jennings). In answer to the Registrar, he said he had built one house at Parkstone, and had sold it, and built two more at Holmswood, the first mortgaged for £2,450 and the second for £700. Altogether he had spent over or about £3000. He did not know that

amount expended was really £1,600. The Official Receiver remarked that he himself and the trustee had gone through the books, from which it appeared that for a debt of £400 the debtor had handed over property valued at £800. The parties referred to were willing to return it if he would take the burden upon the property. He wished to make further inquiries, and as the debtor, he understood, had no objection, he asked for a further adjournment. This was granted, and was fixed for a fortnight hence.
