There were two appeals, and\nthe facts were fully reported in the Timber\nTrades Journal of July 9th, on the original\nhearing. The first appeal involved the construc-\ntion of an agreement dated the 19th February,\n1885, made between Mr. Edward Esdaile and\nthe debtors of the one part, and Mr. J. Kennedy\nEsdaile of the other part, whereby the latter\nagreed to accept the sum of £6,500 in full\nsettlement of his debt of £31,047. It was con-\ntended that by the deed the debt should only\nbe released provided the £6,500 was paid,\nand the release was also subject to the\nstipulation that interest should be paid half-\nyearly on the £6,500. Mr. Justice Cave held\nthat the original debt had never been extin-\nguished, and was liable to revive in the event\nof certain contingencies which had happened,\nnamely, the non-payment of the £6,500 within\nthree years, and the interest thereon in the\nmeantime. He accordingly allowed Mr.\nKennedy Esdaile to prove for the full amount\nof his claim, and against that decision the\ntrustee of the estate appealed.\nMr. Hemmings, Q.C., and Mr. Herbert Reed\nappeared for the trustee, and Mr. Maidlow and\nMr. Ranyard appeared for Mr. Kennedy\nEsdaile. After hearing the arguments, the\nMaster of the Rolls said the agreement was\ncapable of the construction put upon it by Mr.\nJustice Cave, but it was capable of the opposite\nconstruction, and, perhaps, more naturally, and\nthe Court, therefore, according to a well-\nrecognised rule, would take into consideration\nany circumstances existing which would assist\nin determining the proper construction to be\n\nplaced upon the document. Now the circum-\nstances were these. The firm was in the habit\nof discounting with the Bank of England, and\nit became necessary for all the parties to con-\nsider the position, as to the statement to be\nmade to the Bank, in order that those discount\nfacilities should not be discontinued. The\ncondition of the firm at that time was such\nthat if they stated the family claims\nat their full amount it was clear they\ncould not make a satisfactory state-\nment, and this agreement was, therefore,\nentered into. Now in the one view of its\nmeaning —that contended for by Mr. Kennedy\nEsdaile—the statement to the bank would be\nblind. He (the Master of the Rolls) never\nwould impute conduct which was dishonest,\ndishonourable, and deceptive when another\nconstruction of the agreement—indeed the\nmore intelligible one—was open to him, and\nwhich was perfectly consistent with honour and\ncandour by the several parties. He, therefore,\ncame to the conclusion that the statement\nmade to the Bank was a true one, and that the\nagreement was what it purported to be. It\nmeant that Mr. Kennedy Esdaile meant to release the claim absolutely\nexcept to the extent of £6,500, that he did so\nrelease it, and could not revive it, and the\ndecision of Mr. Justice Cave must be reversed.\nLord Justice Lindley concurred. His lordship\nsaid that if the agreement stood alone he could\nnot interpret it to mean that the payment of\n£6,500 should be a condition pre-\ncedent to the release taking place.\nLord Justice Lopes said, to his mind,\nthe first clause of the agreement,\nthat Mr. Kennedy Esdaile should\ntake and accept the sum of £6,500,\"\nmeant that that sum was what he could\nprove for, and, if there were any doubt\nabout it, it was removed by the eighth clause,\nwhich said that in the event of bankruptcy\nhis \"reduced claim\" should become due. It\nwas his view that the intention was that the\nlarger debt should be extinguished and the\nreduced debt substituted for it, and in this\nview it was a perfectly honest, straightforward,\nand clear agreement. The decision of Mr.\nJustice Cave must be reversed.\nThe other appeal involved the validity of cer-\ntain distresses levied by Messrs. Edward Esdaile\nand W. C. Venning for £4,762 0s. 9d., upon the\ngoods and effects of the bankrupts on the 4th\nof January last, the receiving order being made\non the 21st, and the adjudication of bank-\nruptcy on the 6th of April. Of the amount\ndistrained for £2,724 was the balance due to\nthe 29th September, 1884, and the residue was\nfor rent which had accrued since that date.\nThe trustee sought to have it declared that\nprior to the levying of the distresses the bank-\nrupts had committed an act or acts of bank-\nruptcy by giving notice to certain of their\ncreditors that they had suspended or were\nabout to suspend payment of their debts, and\nthat the distresses were, therefore, available\nonly for one year's rent. Mr. Justice Cave\nheld that the debtors had been doing all they\ncould to avoid suspending payment, and that\nso far from doing so, or intimating that they\nwere about to suspend payment, the intention\nof the bankrupts was to go on, his lordship\nobserving, in the course of his judgment, that\nif a creditor had been asked about it he would\nprobably have said, \"Peaty thinks he can\nweather the storm, I don't think he will be\nable to do so, but he is going to try.\" The\nvalidity of the distresses for the full amount\nwas accordingly decreed, and against that\njudgment the trustee now appealed.\nTheir lordships gave judgment affirming the\ndecision of Mr. Justice Cave. They were of\nopinion that the claim of the landlords was\nsustained on the ground that no act of bank-\nruptcy had been proved prior to the levying\nof the distresses, and therefore that the land-\nlord's right was not limited to the one year's rent\nby the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe expressions in Mr. Peaty's letters as\nto the difficulties the house was in, and which\nhad been relied on as constituting a notice of\nintention to suspend, were the natural\nexpressions of a man struggling on and un-\ncertain how his struggles were to end. The\nwords used on 28th December, \"any hope of\nsaving the house is gone,\" were words of\nmomentary despondency or despair, and, said\nthe Master of the Rolls, \"I am not surprised at\nit.\" A more definite and formal intimation was\nrequired by the Act. The appeal was accord-\ningly dismissed.\nJAMES, builder, late of\nThornton Heath, Surrey, now of Kentish\nTown.—The adjourned public examination\ntook place on Friday last, the 5th inst., before\nMr. Registrar Fox. The receiving order was\nmade in the Croydon Court, as briefly reported\nin the Timber Trades Journal at the time, on\nthe petition of Mr. James Neal, of New\nWandsworth, builder and contractor, to whom\nthe debtor owes £148 odd, the amount of a",
