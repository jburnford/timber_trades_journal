FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases
creditors whose names are published in these
lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for
the full amount.]
ESDAILE & CO., timber merchants and
machine sawyers, Nicholas Lane and Wenlock
Road.—This case was brought before the Court
of Appeal, consisting of the Master of the Rolls
and Lords Justices Lindley and Lopes, on
Monday last. There were two appeals, and
the facts were fully reported in the Timber
Trades Journal of July 9th, on the original
hearing. The first appeal involved the construc-
tion of an agreement dated the 19th February,
1885, made between Mr. Edward Esdaile and
the debtors of the one part, and Mr. J. Kennedy
Esdaile of the other part, whereby the latter
agreed to accept the sum of £6,500 in full
settlement of his debt of £31,047. It was con-
tended that by the deed the debt should only
be released provided the £6,500 was paid,
and the release was also subject to the
stipulation that interest should be paid half-
yearly on the £6,500. Mr. Justice Cave held
that the original debt had never been extin-
guished, and was liable to revive in the event
of certain contingencies which had happened,
namely, the non-payment of the £6,500 within
three years, and the interest thereon in the
meantime. He accordingly allowed Mr.
Kennedy Esdaile to prove for the full amount
of his claim, and against that decision the
trustee of the estate appealed.
Mr. Hemmings, Q.C., and Mr. Herbert Reed
appeared for the trustee, and Mr. Maidlow and
Mr. Ranyard appeared for Mr. Kennedy
Esdaile. After hearing the arguments, the
Master of the Rolls said the agreement was
capable of the construction put upon it by Mr.
Justice Cave, but it was capable of the opposite
construction, and, perhaps, more naturally, and
the Court, therefore, according to a well-
recognised rule, would take into consideration
any circumstances existing which would assist
in determining the proper construction to be

placed upon the document. Now the circum-
stances were these. The firm was in the habit
of discounting with the Bank of England, and
it became necessary for all the parties to con-
sider the position, as to the statement to be
made to the Bank, in order that those discount
facilities should not be discontinued. The
condition of the firm at that time was such
that if they stated the family claims
at their full amount it was clear they
could not make a satisfactory state-
ment, and this agreement was, therefore,
entered into. Now in the one view of its
meaning —that contended for by Mr. Kennedy
Esdaile—the statement to the bank would be
blind. He (the Master of the Rolls) never
would impute conduct which was dishonest,
dishonourable, and deceptive when another
construction of the agreement—indeed the
more intelligible one—was open to him, and
which was perfectly consistent with honour and
candour by the several parties. He, therefore,
came to the conclusion that the statement
made to the Bank was a true one, and that the
agreement was what it purported to be. It
meant that Mr. Kennedy Esdaile meant to release the claim absolutely
except to the extent of £6,500, that he did so
release it, and could not revive it, and the
decision of Mr. Justice Cave must be reversed.
Lord Justice Lindley concurred. His lordship
said that if the agreement stood alone he could
not interpret it to mean that the payment of
£6,500 should be a condition pre-
cedent to the release taking place.
Lord Justice Lopes said, to his mind,
the first clause of the agreement,
that Mr. Kennedy Esdaile should
take and accept the sum of £6,500,"
meant that that sum was what he could
prove for, and, if there were any doubt
about it, it was removed by the eighth clause,
which said that in the event of bankruptcy
his "reduced claim" should become due. It
was his view that the intention was that the
larger debt should be extinguished and the
reduced debt substituted for it, and in this
view it was a perfectly honest, straightforward,
and clear agreement. The decision of Mr.
Justice Cave must be reversed.
The other appeal involved the validity of cer-
tain distresses levied by Messrs. Edward Esdaile
and W. C. Venning for £4,762 0s. 9d., upon the
goods and effects of the bankrupts on the 4th
of January last, the receiving order being made
on the 21st, and the adjudication of bank-
ruptcy on the 6th of April. Of the amount
distrained for £2,724 was the balance due to
the 29th September, 1884, and the residue was
for rent which had accrued since that date.
The trustee sought to have it declared that
prior to the levying of the distresses the bank-
rupts had committed an act or acts of bank-
ruptcy by giving notice to certain of their
creditors that they had suspended or were
about to suspend payment of their debts, and
that the distresses were, therefore, available
only for one year's rent. Mr. Justice Cave
held that the debtors had been doing all they
could to avoid suspending payment, and that
so far from doing so, or intimating that they
were about to suspend payment, the intention
of the bankrupts was to go on, his lordship
observing, in the course of his judgment, that
if a creditor had been asked about it he would
probably have said, "Peaty thinks he can
weather the storm, I don't think he will be
able to do so, but he is going to try." The
validity of the distresses for the full amount
was accordingly decreed, and against that
judgment the trustee now appealed.
Their lordships gave judgment affirming the
decision of Mr. Justice Cave. They were of
opinion that the claim of the landlords was
sustained on the ground that no act of bank-
ruptcy had been proved prior to the levying
of the distresses, and therefore that the land-
lord's right was not limited to the one year's rent
by the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.
The expressions in Mr. Peaty's letters as
to the difficulties the house was in, and which
had been relied on as constituting a notice of
intention to suspend, were the natural
expressions of a man struggling on and un-
certain how his struggles were to end. The
words used on 28th December, "any hope of
saving the house is gone," were words of
momentary despondency or despair, and, said
the Master of the Rolls, "I am not surprised at
it." A more definite and formal intimation was
required by the Act. The appeal was accord-
ingly dismissed.
JAMES, builder, late of
Thornton Heath, Surrey, now of Kentish
Town.—The adjourned public examination
took place on Friday last, the 5th inst., before
Mr. Registrar Fox. The receiving order was
made in the Croydon Court, as briefly reported
in the Timber Trades Journal at the time, on
the petition of Mr. James Neal, of New
Wandsworth, builder and contractor, to whom
the debtor owes £148 odd, the amount of a
