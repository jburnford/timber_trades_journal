Allison, Cousland, and Hamilton, brokers.\nQuebec spruce deals, 2nd qty. £ s. d. £ s. d.\n„ „ „ 3rd „ 6 10 7 to 7 18 1 St. Petersburgh std.\n„ „ „ planks 1st „ 7 14 8 „ 8 8 5 „\n„ „ „ „ 2nd „ 6 14 0 „ 7 14 8 „\n„ „ „ „ 3rd „ 6 13 9 „ 7 11 3 „\nSackville (N.B.) spruce deals 7 9 „ „\nAt Greenock, on the 26th ult., Messrs.

Fifty-six cargoes have arrived during the fortnight, consisting chiefly of deals and battens, pit props and sleepers, and two cargoes Baltic square timber.\nWe have had two sales by auction. At Messrs. James Duncan and Co.'s sale on the 24th ult. the attendance was very limited at the commencement, but afterwards there was a large attendance of buyers. Most of the pine and hardwood was disposed of, but being last year's importation prices were rather low, as follow :—\nWaney pine ... ... 2s. 1d.\nSquare „ ... ... 1s. 8d. to 2s. 1d.\nWhitewood ... ... 1s. 6d. to 2s. 1d., according to size.\nOak ... ... ... 2s. 1d. to 2s. 10d.\nAsh ... ... ... 1s. 3d. to 1s. 3 1/2d.\nBlack walnut ... ... 3s. 6d.\nItalian „ ... ... 7d. to 9 1/2d.\nSwedish redwood ... 1s.\nSawn pitch pine ... 1s. 3 1/2d.\nHewn „ „ ... 1s. 3 1/2d. to 1s. 4 1/2d.\nRiga white deals ... 10 1/2 x 3, 3d.\n„ „ „ ... 9 x 3, 2 1/8d. to 2 1/2d.\nWyborg red „ ... 9 x 3, 3 1/8d.\n„ „ „ ... 7 x 2 1/2, 2d.\nDram battens ... 7 x 2 1/2, 1 7/8d.\nNarva deals ... ... 11 x 3, 3 1/8d.\nPetersburg „ ... 7 x 3, 2 1/8d.\nMessrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. on the 31st held a sale of deals and battens. The company was very small, and competition could not be got; ultimately, however, through perseverance, a good many lots were cleared off. The following were the prices realized :—\nGefle red deals 9 x 3 2 1/8d.\n„ „ „ 11 x 4 4 1/8d. to 4 1/2d.\n„ „ „ 12 x 4 4 1/8d.\n\nRiga red, 1st ... ... 7 x 2 1/2 2d., short lengths, 1 1/2d. to 1 5/8d.\n„ white ... ... 9 x 3 2 1/8d.\nWyborg ... ... 11 x 3, 3 1/4d., short lengths, 2 1/2d.\n„ ... ... 7 x 2 1/2, 1 5/8d.\nFreights, Sundswall to Grangemouth, timber 48s. offered.\n„ Riga to Grangemouth, 40s. to 42s. 6d.\nTonnage wanted, Soderhamn to Grangemouth, timber.\n„ „ Gefle to Leith deals.\n„ „ Ljusne, 300 loads, Leith or Grangemouth.\n\nImports of Timber, &c.\nLONDON.—From July 19th to August 1st.\nHewn Timber (loads).\nRussia—8,651 Burt & Co.\n2,063 Gabriel & Sons.\n150 Sieveking & Co.\n100 J.
