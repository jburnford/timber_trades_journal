[AUGUST 4, 1877.

GLASGOW.
(From our own Correspondent.)
August 1st, 1877.
The fortnight's arrivals into Clyde amount to 11 cargoes Quebec timber and deals, 3 cargoes Lower Port deals, and 1 cargo Pensacola pitch pine.
The total import this year—till date—largely exceeds that of any previous season, and as comparatively little is going into immediate consumption, storage accommodation is taxed to the utmost.
The continuation of the lock-out on the Clyde is, under these circumstances, very unfortunate.
It is reported, however, that various orders have been booked in view of an early termination of the dispute, and that others are in the market ready to be placed when the requisite degree of confidence has been re-established to justify shipbuilders in filling up the specifications which have been offered to them.
The auction sales to be reported at this time are as follow :—

LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.)
August 1st, 1877.
Since my last report the arrivals of wood goods have been coming in very regularly. Fifty-six cargoes have arrived during the fortnight, consisting chiefly of deals and battens, pit props and sleepers, and two cargoes Baltic square timber.
We have had two sales by auction. At Messrs. James Duncan and Co.'s sale on the 24th ult. the attendance was very limited at the commencement, but afterwards there was a large attendance of buyers. Most of the pine and hardwood was disposed of, but being last year's importation prices were rather low, as follow :—
Waney pine ... ... 2s. 1d.
Square „ ... ... 1s. 8d. to 2s. 1d.
Whitewood ... ... 1s. 6d. to 2s. 1d., according to size.

Petersburg „ ... 7 x 3, 2 1/8d.
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville, and Co. on the 31st held a sale of deals and battens. The company was very small, and competition could not be got; ultimately, however, through perseverance, a good many lots were cleared off. The following were the prices realized :—
Gefle red deals 9 x 3 2 1/8d.
