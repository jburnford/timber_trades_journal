A TALE OF A SPRING LATCH.—Mr. Kelk, cashier to the building firm of Withy & Co., Middleton, Hartlepool, has melancholy reasons to deplore the fixing of a spring lock that opened only outside.
Quite recently married, he had invited a party of friends to his house, and his young wife in her anxiety to get rid of the hot air, ventured up-stairs, and seeing a small closet with a current of air closed the door.
In vain she called to the servants, although she could hear the door-bell ring and her visitors enter; and as none suspected that the imprisoned lady was in the roof of the house, all the other parts of the dwelling and grounds were searched.
One of the visitors suggested that there might be an old oak chest with a secret spring, and this gave the clue to the closet, and when at last found, Mrs. Kelk was seriously ill and hysterical.
Violent epileptic fits followed, and the shock being more than the nervous system could sustain, death shortly put an end to the poor young lady's sufferings.
The sad affair has not only prostrated the unhappy husband, but cast a gloom around the whole town.
