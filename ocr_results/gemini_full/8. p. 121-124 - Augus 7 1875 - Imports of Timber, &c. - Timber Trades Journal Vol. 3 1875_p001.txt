WEST HARTLEPOOL.
(From our own Correspondent.) August 4th, 1875.
We have very little, if any, alteration to report here since our last communication. There has been a steady influx of wood, more so than during the preceding fortnight, and consequently we are a little better situated with regard to the throng on the quay-side, but the orders from the yard are more in arrears, and the daily annoyance occurring through the inefficient supply of waggons is really abominable. We observe by the report from our Newcastle correspondent that they are in a similar predicament to ourselves on the Tyne, and it is quite evident that wheresoever the North-Eastern Railway Company have a monopoly business is in a measure retarded by those means which should increase it. Homeward freights have been steady advancing during the past few weeks, but they are somewhat quieter at present. Business may be done, however, @ Kotka deals, battens, and boards, 44s.; Fredrickshamn deals, battens, and boards, 42s.; Bjorneborg deals, battens, and boards, 42s. 6d.; Riga deals and battens, 37s. 6d.; Swartwick deals and battens, 40s.; Skutskar deals, battens, and boards, 42s. 6d.

LEITH.
(From our own Correspondent.) 5th August, 1875.
I have nothing new to report in the timber trade. The arrivals at the various ports have been considerably on the increase. Say 23 cargoes deals and battens, 7 cargoes Baltic timber, 1 cargo mahogany, 15 cargoes pit props, 9 cargoes sleepers, various lots of lathwood, Baltic and fir staves. Two cargoes of Quebec timber are daily expected, and several shipments will arrive at the fall—October or November.
We have had one sale, deals and battens, and one, American timber, also a lot of Baltic. These sales were very well attended, but prices ruled low.
Messrs. Mitchell, Somerville & Co. will offer for sale on the 10th inst., Head of Queen's Dock, Wyborg and Narva deals and battens. Messrs. Shadbolt & Son will offer the entire cargo, Tabasco mahogany, ex Nornen, on the 19th current, at the Sands, foot of Constitution Street.

GLASGOW.
(From our own Correspondent.) August 3rd, 1875.
The past fortnight being the annual fair holidays and also stock-taking time with a good many in the trade, very little business has been done.
At Yorkhill Timber Yards two public sales, however, have taken place; one on the 27th, ult., when a cargo of Tabasco mahogany ex "Spes Nortia" @ Chiltepec was offered; Singleton, Dunn, and Co., agents. The entire cargo, consisting of 220 logs mahogany, was sold at prices ranging from 3½d. to 11¾d., averaging about 6d.; the curls from 4d. to 7d. A few lots of Mexican mahogany (remainders of cargoes imported here about two months ago) were also sold, bringing 3½d. to 7d. per foot.

There was a fair attendance at this sale; but the bidding was not spirited.
On the following day, the 28th ult., several cargoes of American deals, Quebec and Lower Port, were exposed to public competition in the same yards. A cargo of good Bathurst spruce deals sold at from £7 15s. to £8 5s. St. Petersburg standard and Newport pine at about the same rates. Very few lots of the Quebec deals were sold, and the prices offered appeared to be unremunerative to the exposers. At recent auctions the following rates were realised for Quebec timber:—Greenock:—Quebec boardwood, about 23 ft. average, 2s. 4d. per cub. ft.; ditto, 18 ft. average, 1s. 10½d. per cub. ft.; and a parcel of St. John's, 60 ft. to 70 ft., 1s. 9d. Building timber, 45 ft. to 60 ft., 17d. to 19d. per foot. Up to the corresponding period of last year 162,000 Quebec deals were imported into Clyde, as against 88,000 this year, and from St. John and other low ports 502,000 pcs. last year as against 220,000 pcs. this year.

CARDIFF.
(From Messrs. Tellefsen, Wills, & Co.'s Circular.) July 15th, 1875.
We have very little change in the timber trade of our port to record this month. The stock of deals and battens in the timber-yards are getting low, and as building and other operations are extending in this district, local merchants are looking forward to an improvement in business, which was trying enough during the strike.
The supply of pitwood is again in advance of the demand, owing to the arrival of a large fleet of cargoes of pit props from the French ports, consequently prices have declined, perhaps the more so owing to the rapid fall in price of coal, which naturally makes colliery proprietors postpone buying longer than usual. Holders of forest land in France, and owners of plantations at home, are demanding prices for their wood which, were it not for the unusual lowness of freights ruling at present, would make business quite prohibitory.
