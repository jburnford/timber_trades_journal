  "text": "FEBRUARY 21, 1885] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 153\n\nthe most seaward of the Norwegian ports,\nas in previous years we have frequently\nwitnessed many of these arriving about\nthe middle and latter part of February.\nWe observe a little export trade is now\non the way, and have pleasure in recording\nit, as denoting a gradual extension of\nbusiness activity. Messrs. R. Wade, Sons, &\nCo. are the shippers of about 120 loads of\nfir timber, by sailing vessel, to Boston\n(Lincolnshire), and exported outwards\nforeign we notice the steamship Story Lee\nis taking on board a quantity of creosoted\nsleepers to Bombay.\nThere is scarcely any change to report\nin the condition of the demand, orders\nappear to be a trifle fluctuating in some\nbranches of the trade, but viewing\nthe demand, collectively, after noting\ncarefully the work going on in each depart-\nment, we are conscious of a clear and dis-\ntinct progress being made, though probably\nit would give more general satisfaction if\nthe rate of progression were a little quicker.\nOrders are rather quiet for sawn wood, and\nas we seldom, if ever, remember a time\nduring which the imports of these goods\nhave been less than those seen recently,\nstocks are consequently showing a material\ndecrease with every succeeding week; a\nfurther indication of lessened supplies is\nalso seen in the quantity of deals and bat-\ntens that are being cross-cut for required\nspecifications.\n\nTYNE.\nThe only arrivals to chronicle during the\nlast seven days are some parcels per Odin and\nAlpha from Christiania, no other wood goods\nhaving come to hand for some time. Trade\nis going forward in an even, quiet manner,\nno very great demand, but a fair, quiet\namount going forward. A few ships are\nbeing inquired for for first open water, and\nsome charters are reported at about 26s.\nfrom Sundswall and adjacent ports to the\nTyne, but so far the amounts contracted\nfor in this district are not very large.\n\nCARDIFF.\nIf any alteration has taken place in our\ntimber market during the past week, it is\nfor the worse. We understand some of our\nleading merchants do not intend to buy\nanything this side of Midsummer, and if\nthey should feel tempted to do business\nbefore that time it will no doubt be at ex-\ntremely low c.i.f. figures. As is well known,\ntrade is in every possible respect as bad as\nit can be; nevertheless, some speculators\nfancy things will become still more de-\npressed, and are actually contracting\nspeculatively in anticipation of prices and\nfreights suffering a further decline. French\nprops remain in much the same state, and\nthe ruling selling price may be taken as\nbeing 11s. per ton ex ship, although occa-\nsional lots have been sold below this\nfigure. Norway mining timber continues\ndull, there is hardly any clearing out of the\nlarge stocks that have been now nearly\ntwelve months on the bank.\n\nSUNDERLAND.\nSince my last report importations are\nconfined to the steamship Goteborg, one of\nthe regular Gothenburg traders. She\nbrings a quantity of deals, battens, and\nboards, and the usual cargo of props, crown-\nwood, and sleepers, all for local importers.\nA vessel was towed in here some days\nsince after having been some time on the\nDogger Bank, Blyth; she was consider-\nably damaged, and was kept afloat by her cargo\nof wood goods, which consist of timber and\npitch pine for Messrs. R. Wade, and a cargo of timber\nfor Messrs. Gothenberg from Horsley &\nMessrs. George also one of the\nlatter port to bend a small\nfor Messrs. Harrison &\nMr. A. Reid and Messrs.\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, and in\nto 4,000 bundles of laths\nMr. C. Brown.\nness of every description is\nmany steamers are lying\nbooks for lack of freight\nwhich presents itself to our\nremarkable absence of sailing\nwood cargoes arriving from\n\nGRIMSBY.\nThere are no arrivals of wood goods at\nthis port during the past week, but we learn\nthat Messrs. Bennetts & Co. have a cargo of\npitch pine due to arrive.\nIn departures we notice the Godiva (s), for\nSouthampton, with creosoted sleepers; the\nLady of the Lake, for Portsmouth, with\ndeals.\nThroughout the winter, it will be noticed,\nthere has been a very active coast trade\ndone from Grimsby. The same has been\nnoticed with regard to Hull. This movement\nhas all been towards the south, and in large\nmeasure is traceable to the increasing annual\ndifficulty of getting small ships from the\nBaltic to the outports.\nA fair amount of wood has been drawn\nfrom the east coast to London—indeed, it\nhas been moving freely all round the island—\nthe most noteworthy being a considerable\namount of Quebec oak from the Clyde to\nWhite Sea goods. On the whole this firm\nseems to be more active than it has been of\nlate years.\nWith regard to the improvement of the\nnavigation of the river Trent, a detail of\nconsiderable importance to the merchants\nof Grimsby, we learn that the Corporation of\nNottingham have decided to buy the rights\nof the old Trent Navigation Company for\n£70,000; should this decision be confirmed\nby the town's meeting of the inhabitants, a\nchange in the water traffic inland will\nshortly be inaugurated.\nThere is a little rivalry at present between\nGrimsby and Hull in connection with the\nnew trade of shipping Australian wool\ndirect to the Humber. Last year the\nWinefred, the first vessel, arrived in Hull.\nThis year the same vessel, with a sister\nship, is on passage to Grimsby, where it\nseems probable the trade will locate itself.\nThere was some prospect of a timber trade\nbeing done in Hull from Australia, and a\nfew logs of honeysuckle wood came as\nstowage. This, owing to the wood being in\nthe round and green instead of being in the\nplank, became tainted on passage,\nand worthless. This highly ornamental\nwood, so popular in London for bedroom\nfurniture, will no doubt make its appear-\nance in Grimsby in connection with this\nAustralian wool trade.\n\nGLASGOW.\nDuring the past week no auction sales\nhave been called by brokers here. Deliveries\nhave been going on to a considerable\nextent; best qualities of pine in log and\ndeals are in demand, and selected sizes of\nspruce deals, and for these prices hold firm\nmeantime.\nThere were 84,356 pieces deals delivered\nfrom Yorkhill Yard last month, as against\n72,000 pieces in January, 1884. The figures\nfor the current month, however, show a\nfalling off compared with corresponding\nperiod last year. Imports have been light\nsince the beginning of the year. At corre-\nsponding date last year there had been im-\nported there four cargoes of pitch pine; this year\nthere has only been one. The stock of this\non hand at 31st December last was\nmuch heavier than usual, and as the con-\nsumption going on is moderate, a lighter\nimport this year will apparently suffice.\nThe usual weekly arrivals of staves, oak\nplanks, &c., have been coming to hand per\nAmerican liners from the States. There have\nbeen over 100,000 staves imported since\n1st January in this way. Fewer oak planks\nhave been coming forward than there were\nlast year, and of walnut only 30 logs have\nbeen received, which were sold ex quay.\nThe market is bare of walnut at present.\nThe dulness of the auction sales of\nAmerican woods we had to report lately\nis, perhaps, be owing to buyers being\npretty well supplied privately, especially\nby those near our own doors, whose position as\nimporters is well known, and to suit their\nrequirements for certain kinds of wood\nseller and buyer frequently together.\n\nWhatever the reason may be, the attendance\nat these recent public sales was small and\nbidding languid. Public sales are helped\nby the presence of country buyers, who\nhave in this market a convenient centre for\nsupplying their necessities.\nAdvantage is sometimes taken of their\npresence in large numbers at public sales of\nwoods, as walnut, birch, ash, &c., which is\nequally advantageous to seller and buyer.\n\nLEITH.\nThe imports for the past week are again\nof the lightest description. Trade remains\nin a stagnant condition, with little imme-\ndiate prospect of improvement.\nOn Tuesday last Messrs. Wm. Thomson\n& Co. exposed for sale, on the Sands, an\nassortment of Baltic and American timber.\nA fair company of consumers attended, but\nlittle business could be done unless at\nprices that left but a small margin. Waney\nyellow pine did not seem to be in great\ndemand, only a few lots being knocked down\nat from 23d. to 2s. 6d. per cubic ft. Square\npine did not sell well, 15d. being the limit.\nA few lots of oak were sold at from\n2s. 4d. to 2s. 7d.\nLike the other American goods, ash did\nnot seem to be wanted, as only a few logs\nwere sold at 15d. and 18d per cub. ft.\nMore business was done, however, with\nthe deals and battens, although even here\nmatters hung a good deal, and purchasers\nwere slow in coming forward.\nThe following are the principal prices\nrealized:—\n9 x 3 white Riga deals ... 1¾d. per lin. ft.\n9 x 3 white Sundswall ... 2d. „\n9 x 3 red „ ... 2¼d. „\n6½ x 2½ red „ ... 1¾d. „\n6½ x 2½ white battens ... 1d. „\nWaney yellow pine 1s. 11d. to 2s. 6d. per c. ft.\nSquare „ ... 15d. „\nOak „ ... 2s. 4d. to 2s. 7d. „\nAsh „ ... 15d. to 18d. „\n\nIMPORTS, &c.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbre-\nviate the names of importers when by so doing a\nline can be saved.
