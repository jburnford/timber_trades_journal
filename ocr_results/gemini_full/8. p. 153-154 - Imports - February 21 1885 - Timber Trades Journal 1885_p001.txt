FEBRUARY 21, 1885] THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 153

the most seaward of the Norwegian ports,
as in previous years we have frequently
witnessed many of these arriving about
the middle and latter part of February.
We observe a little export trade is now
on the way, and have pleasure in recording
it, as denoting a gradual extension of
business activity. Messrs. R. Wade, Sons, &
Co. are the shippers of about 120 loads of
fir timber, by sailing vessel, to Boston
(Lincolnshire), and exported outwards
foreign we notice the steamship Story Lee
is taking on board a quantity of creosoted
sleepers to Bombay.
There is scarcely any change to report
in the condition of the demand, orders
appear to be a trifle fluctuating in some
branches of the trade, but viewing
the demand, collectively, after noting
carefully the work going on in each depart-
ment, we are conscious of a clear and dis-
tinct progress being made, though probably
it would give more general satisfaction if
the rate of progression were a little quicker.
Orders are rather quiet for sawn wood, and
as we seldom, if ever, remember a time
during which the imports of these goods
have been less than those seen recently,
stocks are consequently showing a material
decrease with every succeeding week; a
further indication of lessened supplies is
also seen in the quantity of deals and bat-
tens that are being cross-cut for required
specifications.

TYNE.
The only arrivals to chronicle during the
last seven days are some parcels per Odin and
Alpha from Christiania, no other wood goods
having come to hand for some time. Trade
is going forward in an even, quiet manner,
no very great demand, but a fair, quiet
amount going forward. A few ships are
being inquired for for first open water, and
some charters are reported at about 26s.
from Sundswall and adjacent ports to the
Tyne, but so far the amounts contracted
for in this district are not very large.

CARDIFF.
If any alteration has taken place in our
timber market during the past week, it is
for the worse. We understand some of our
leading merchants do not intend to buy
anything this side of Midsummer, and if
they should feel tempted to do business
before that time it will no doubt be at ex-
tremely low c.i.f. figures. As is well known,
trade is in every possible respect as bad as
it can be; nevertheless, some speculators
fancy things will become still more de-
pressed, and are actually contracting
speculatively in anticipation of prices and
freights suffering a further decline. French
props remain in much the same state, and
the ruling selling price may be taken as
being 11s. per ton ex ship, although occa-
sional lots have been sold below this
figure. Norway mining timber continues
dull, there is hardly any clearing out of the
large stocks that have been now nearly
twelve months on the bank.

SUNDERLAND.
Since my last report importations are
confined to the steamship Goteborg, one of
the regular Gothenburg traders. She
brings a quantity of deals, battens, and
boards, and the usual cargo of props, crown-
wood, and sleepers, all for local importers.
A vessel was towed in here some days
since after having been some time on the
Dogger Bank, Blyth; she was consider-
ably damaged, and was kept afloat by her cargo
of wood goods, which consist of timber and
pitch pine for Messrs. R. Wade, and a cargo of timber
for Messrs. Gothenberg from Horsley &
Messrs. George also one of the
latter port to bend a small
for Messrs. Harrison &
Mr. A. Reid and Messrs.
Newcastle-on-Tyne, and in
to 4,000 bundles of laths
Mr. C. Brown.
ness of every description is
many steamers are lying
books for lack of freight
which presents itself to our
remarkable absence of sailing
wood cargoes arriving from

GRIMSBY.
There are no arrivals of wood goods at
this port during the past week, but we learn
that Messrs. Bennetts & Co. have a cargo of
pitch pine due to arrive.
In departures we notice the Godiva (s), for
Southampton, with creosoted sleepers; the
Lady of the Lake, for Portsmouth, with
deals.
Throughout the winter, it will be noticed,
there has been a very active coast trade
done from Grimsby. The same has been
noticed with regard to Hull. This movement
has all been towards the south, and in large
measure is traceable to the increasing annual
difficulty of getting small ships from the
Baltic to the outports.
A fair amount of wood has been drawn
from the east coast to London—indeed, it
has been moving freely all round the island—
the most noteworthy being a considerable
amount of Quebec oak from the Clyde to
White Sea goods. On the whole this firm
seems to be more active than it has been of
late years.
With regard to the improvement of the
navigation of the river Trent, a detail of
considerable importance to the merchants
of Grimsby, we learn that the Corporation of
Nottingham have decided to buy the rights
of the old Trent Navigation Company for
£70,000; should this decision be confirmed
by the town's meeting of the inhabitants, a
change in the water traffic inland will
shortly be inaugurated.
There is a little rivalry at present between
Grimsby and Hull in connection with the
new trade of shipping Australian wool
direct to the Humber. Last year the
Winefred, the first vessel, arrived in Hull.
This year the same vessel, with a sister
ship, is on passage to Grimsby, where it
seems probable the trade will locate itself.
There was some prospect of a timber trade
being done in Hull from Australia, and a
few logs of honeysuckle wood came as
stowage. This, owing to the wood being in
the round and green instead of being in the
plank, became tainted on passage,
and worthless. This highly ornamental
wood, so popular in London for bedroom
furniture, will no doubt make its appear-
ance in Grimsby in connection with this
Australian wool trade.

GLASGOW.
During the past week no auction sales
have been called by brokers here. Deliveries
have been going on to a considerable
extent; best qualities of pine in log and
deals are in demand, and selected sizes of
spruce deals, and for these prices hold firm
meantime.
There were 84,356 pieces deals delivered
from Yorkhill Yard last month, as against
72,000 pieces in January, 1884. The figures
for the current month, however, show a
falling off compared with corresponding
period last year. Imports have been light
since the beginning of the year. At corre-
sponding date last year there had been im-
ported there four cargoes of pitch pine; this year
there has only been one. The stock of this
on hand at 31st December last was
much heavier than usual, and as the con-
sumption going on is moderate, a lighter
import this year will apparently suffice.
The usual weekly arrivals of staves, oak
planks, &c., have been coming to hand per
American liners from the States. There have
been over 100,000 staves imported since
1st January in this way. Fewer oak planks
have been coming forward than there were
last year, and of walnut only 30 logs have
been received, which were sold ex quay.
The market is bare of walnut at present.
The dulness of the auction sales of
American woods we had to report lately
is, perhaps, be owing to buyers being
pretty well supplied privately, especially
by those near our own doors, whose position as
importers is well known, and to suit their
requirements for certain kinds of wood
seller and buyer frequently together.

Whatever the reason may be, the attendance
at these recent public sales was small and
bidding languid. Public sales are helped
by the presence of country buyers, who
have in this market a convenient centre for
supplying their necessities.
Advantage is sometimes taken of their
presence in large numbers at public sales of
woods, as walnut, birch, ash, &c., which is
equally advantageous to seller and buyer.

LEITH.
The imports for the past week are again
of the lightest description. Trade remains
in a stagnant condition, with little imme-
diate prospect of improvement.
On Tuesday last Messrs. Wm. Thomson
& Co. exposed for sale, on the Sands, an
assortment of Baltic and American timber.
A fair company of consumers attended, but
little business could be done unless at
prices that left but a small margin. Waney
yellow pine did not seem to be in great
demand, only a few lots being knocked down
at from 23d. to 2s. 6d. per cubic ft. Square
pine did not sell well, 15d. being the limit.
A few lots of oak were sold at from
2s. 4d. to 2s. 7d.
Like the other American goods, ash did
not seem to be wanted, as only a few logs
were sold at 15d. and 18d per cub. ft.
More business was done, however, with
the deals and battens, although even here
matters hung a good deal, and purchasers
were slow in coming forward.
The following are the principal prices
realized:—
9 x 3 white Riga deals ... 1¾d. per lin. ft.
9 x 3 white Sundswall ... 2d. „
9 x 3 red „ ... 2¼d. „
6½ x 2½ red „ ... 1¾d. „
6½ x 2½ white battens ... 1d. „
Waney yellow pine 1s. 11d. to 2s. 6d. per c. ft.
Square „ ... 15d. „
Oak „ ... 2s. 4d. to 2s. 7d. „
Ash „ ... 15d. to 18d. „
