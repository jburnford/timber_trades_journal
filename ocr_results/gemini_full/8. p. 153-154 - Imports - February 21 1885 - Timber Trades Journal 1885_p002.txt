THE LARGEST OUTPUT OF SHINGLES.—The largest output of shingles ever placed on the market in a single season by any one company was that of the Grand Haven Company for the season of 1884, amounting to 120,703,000.

A CAUSE OF FAILURE.—The principle laid down in the Bankruptcy Act of 1884, of the Official Receiver's extracting from the bankrupts the causes of their failures is, in some cases, a source of amusement. In the recent examination of Chas. Emerson Barton, engineer, at the Grimsby Court, he stated, as one source of loss in his business, that he had unsuccessfully experimented with machinery for obtaining perpetual motion. The Official Receiver said, "You mean that you tried to discover something and failed?" to which the bankrupt replied, "Yes, sir."

[FEBRUARY 21, 1885.]
THE CLAIMS OF SYLVICULTURE.
At the seventh ordinary meeting of the Scottish Horticultural Association, in St. Andrew's Square, Edinburgh, on the 3rd inst., a paper was read by Mr. Gordon, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, on the "Claims of Sylviculture." Defining sylviculture, as the culture of trees, or arboriculture, as the growing of trees on a purely economic footing, he remarked that this had languished because the coalfields had supplied us with fuel, while for the supply of timber foreign forests had supplied us with timber. Now, however, that natural supplies were disappearing from foreign countries, the claims of sylviculture were beginning to assert themselves. Speaking of its claims as a national industry, he said it was not meant that it should be bolstered up by the State, and controlled exclusively by the State. What was wanted from the State was that on favourable terms and with reasonable security it might safely be left to British enterprise. The State was not beyond its province in becoming a monopolist; and in directing all the branches of a new industry than in pursuing any branch of enterprise. As to the causes that had repelled capital from this industry were rapidly disappearing, the sooner it settled down to the proper work the better, for a dearth of timber would certainly be experienced by men now living. We had in the United Kingdom a raw state all the materials necessary to ensure going sylviculture. We had a faithful, energetic, fairly anxious to be better instructed foresters who were intelligent, and we had acquired during the last half century, along with others that seemed worthless, many species of exotic trees that were full of promise, and and our knowledge of them and their culture was daily increasing. With regard to forestry education, that question was some years ago committed to the Council of the Arboricultural Society; but having had a share of the responsibilities of that Council for two years, and attended all its meetings, he was prepared to assure them that the question had not once been before them. Why, he asked, this delay, this tampering with so important a question? The question of education was not the most important question for foresters in Scotland. The Scottish forester was one who had to manage woods subject to the wishes of his employer. This meant a good deal in the prospectus of a school of forestry might never be placed. Foresters, knowing this, had had no motive for pressing forward the educational question. That forestry must become an industry before it became a city. They were at present to attend a Forestry Congress. He believed that some such thing as this had come somehow to him from a cloudless sky, and under, and would no doubt strike others as the same. He did not know what subjects were chosen for discussion, but he earnestly wished that the discussion should be those by which he had followed, cribbed, confined. By following the reading of the paper, Mr. Fraser thought there was at present far too much of education for foresters. He held that the education of foresters was similar to that of gardeners, and with the appliances and the cheapness of kinds of literature of the present day a studious young man could educate himself. Let him read, let him think for himself, let him go into the woods and give him an axe in his hand, and let him go to study nature for himself. He did not see any necessity for a school of forestry at all. He thought the likelihood of sylviculture being taken up by landlords as a patriotic duty should require more from their forester than that he had given that time to a scarce commodity. He thought it unlikely while some kinds of foreign timber could compete, unless the price should be very considerably increased; and he did not see much appearance of that in the meantime. Mr. Morrison was of opinion that no man could get too much education for any one else; and the importance of having our foresters thoroughly educated if they were to hold their own with those of other nations was accorded to Mr. Gordon, for which a collection of flowers and fruits was exhibited to the society.

THE GAZETTE.
FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]
HENRY ARCHIBALD KELSEY.—At the London Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, Mr. Bigham, Q.C., barrister, instructed by Mr. A. Freeman, solicitor, applied for the Court to approve a scheme of composition which the bankrupt agreed to pay a composition of 3s. in the pound, and so abandon the bankruptcy proceedings, which Mr. Boxall said he heard would only yield 2s. 6d. in the pound. The bankrupt was a decorator and contractor, of at Peas Pottage, near Crawley. Two meetings of the creditors had been held, at the first of which the bankrupt offered a composition of 15s. in the pound, but at the second only 7s. 6d. in the pound. The total liabilities were £2,300. The scheme received the sanction of the Judge, though opposed by the Official Receiver on the ground of hazardous speculation.

ALFRED BROWN.—At the Salisbury Bankruptcy Court, on Friday, bankrupt surrendered for the purpose of being further examined. After a few questions by the trustee and the Official Receiver, a further adjournment was made.

JOHN BAINBRIDGE ELLIS, timber merchant, Grimsby.—This bankrupt came up for his public examination in the Grimsby Bankruptcy Court on the 11th inst., and was supported by Mr. Wintringham. The statement of affairs showed gross liabilities £1,077, assets £155, leaving a deficiency of £922. The Official Receiver (Mr. Forder) put a series of questions to the debtor, eliciting that he had been in business as a timber merchant since 1871, and at Grimsby since 1881. He had had transactions with Smith-Woolleys, and Wigram, of Lincoln, under the name of John Bainbridge, because his son, who was travelling for him, would not be credited by that firm. He had received and disposed of £600 worth of timber since October last, but he had no accounts whatever to show to whom it had been sold, or whether any payments had been made. He was associated with a son in a contract for the cleansing of the Corporation cesspools for £440 a year, but he did not think there had been any profit from the contract. In reply to Mr. Wintringham, the debtor accounted for £300 out of the £600 by transactions with his brother, Mr. S. Ellis. The Official Receiver said he must ask for an adjournment of the examination for an amended statement of accounts. Mr. Wintringham said he could not oppose the application; but he put a few questions to the debtor, which elicited answers to the effect that neither his sons nor his brothers had had anything to do with the profits on his timber trade. The examination was adjourned until the 11th of March.

G. WEBBER & Co.—At the Brighton Bankruptcy Court on the 12th inst. the debtors, George Webber and L. S. G. Young, whose first meeting of creditors was fully reported in our issue of the 7th, were examined before the Registrar. In course of the examination it was elicited that they commenced business in October, 1883, Webber having plant stock to the value of £80, and Young putting into it £200. The latter had since made advances to the amount of £1,231. They discovered their insolvency in November of last year. Webber drew £2 weekly out of the business; Young nothing. The debtors were then examined as to their separate estates. On Wednesday last an adjourned meeting of creditors was held, at which Mr. Pope, solicitor, on behalf of the debtors, made an offer of 3s. 6d. in the £, the first moiety to be payable within three weeks after the composition had been sanctioned by the Court, and the second to be secured to the satisfaction of Messrs. Farmiloe & Co., who had investigated the affairs of the bankrupts, and payable within three months of the first payment. After a prolonged discussion the offer was accepted.

R. & H. PICKERSGILL.—The recently reported failure of these debtors, of Streatham, builders and contractors, was held last week before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt. They were of 6, West Street, Soho, carrying on business in conjunction, and their accounts disclosed gross liabilities to the amount of £28,624, of which only £4,397 was expected to rank, the deficiency being £2,060. It appears that in December, 1883, the debtors filed a petition for liquidation under which a composition of 10s. in the pound was accepted, payable by four equal instalments. The first instalment was paid, but the second not being met, the debtors were called upon to execute a deed of assignment, which they did in September, 1884. They were now briefly examined, and stated [?]

W. H. WEBBER.—The first meeting of the creditors of William Henry Webber, of the Salisbury Bank, was held last week at the offices of the Official Receiver, Mr. F. Aston Dawes. The debtor is described as a timber merchant, carrying on business at Fisherton, Salisbury. The statement of accounts showed liabilities £1,301, and assets £511. The debtor commenced business in 1881, with a capital of £200. He attributes his failure to bad debts, and to having had to pay a heavy rent for his premises. A resolution was passed to the effect that the debtor should be adjudged bankrupt, and Mr. H. C. Pershouse, of Bristol, was appointed trustee. A committee of inspection was also chosen, consisting of Mr. S. Chandler, Mr. T. S. Futcher, and Mr. W. H. Williams. The receiving order was made on the debtor's own petition. The following are the principal creditors:—[?]
