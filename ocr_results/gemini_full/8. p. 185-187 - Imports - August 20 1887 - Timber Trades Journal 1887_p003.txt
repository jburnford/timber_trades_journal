LEGAL INTELLIGENCE
CONDITIONS OF SHIPMENT.
METZELES v. GAIRARD.
This was a suit heard before the Marseilles Tribunal of Commerce to compel the purchaser of a cargo of timber to take delivery. A condition of the sale made by Metzeles to Gairard was that the timber was to be shipped during the months of November or December, 1886, by a vessel of from 400 to 600 tons net. Metzeles offered the cargo of the Fredstro of 714 tons register, the loading of which had commenced in the month of October. The quantity did not exceed that of a ship of 600 tons register. It was not shown that the purchaser suffered any prejudice by the shipment in October, or by the timber being carried in a vessel of greater tonnage; but claimed the strict execution of the contract. He had besides informed the seller before the end of the month of October that he would not accept the cargo of the Fredstro.
The Tribunal gave judgment that the fact of Metzeles persisting in offering the cargo of the Fredstro proved that he had been unable to procure a ship of from 400 to 600 tons during the two months stipulated. He, therefore, failed to execute the contract, and had no right to modify it for his convenience. The sale must be cancelled, with costs against the seller.

FAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.
It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.
BAILEY, ARTHUR MARTIN, builder, Manchester Street, and Little Portland Street, Southampton.—The adjourned public examination of this debtor was held at Southampton on the 11th inst., before Mr. Registrar Daw. Mr. H. D. M. Page appeared for the bankrupt, who in answer to the trustee (Mr J. J. Burnett) said that while in partnership with his father he was supposed to have one-half the profits, but that was never estimated. He had no regular weekly allowance, and what he did draw was put down in the wages list. The examination was adjourned pending the confirmation by the Board of Trade of Mr. Burnett’s appointment as trustee, and, as he had no further questions to put, the bankrupt would be allowed to pass his public examination.
BEESLEY, JOHN, upholsterer, Reading. —The official details have been issued in this recent failure. They show gross liabilities £202 9s. 7d., of which £192 10s. 9d. is expected to rank against the estate for dividend. The gross assets are £70 19s. 3d., and the net assets, after deduction of £9 18s. 10d. due on preferential claims, £61 0s. 5d., the deficiency being £131 10s. 4d. The debtor has been in business since 1877, when he started with a capital of £50; and he states that he became aware of his insolvency about a month ago, which he attributes to bad trade. He was formerly in partnership with a Mr. Hughes, of Bournemouth, which partnership was dissolved about 1884. As to the debtor’s books the Official Receiver says they do not appear to have been properly kept, nor do they afford much information as to the debtor’s financial position and business transactions.
BROOM, GEORGE, mahogany and timber merchant, Wilmer Gardens, Hoxton.—This case was reported last week, and the first meeting of creditors was held on Wednesday before Mr. Wreford, Assistant Receiver. The unsecured liabilities were stated in the accounts

at £1,704 13s. 1d. and the assets at £601 16s. 3d. It appeared that in December, 1875, the debtor, who was then trading in partnership with his son, filed a petition for liquidation, and under those proceedings he had not obtained his discharge. The Chairman, in reply to Mr. Hofferberth (a creditor) stated that the fact of the debtor being undischarged under the former proceedings was a fatal obstacle to any proposal, and the case must go into bankruptcy. That being the case, the only effect of the prior proceedings would be to compel the bankrupt to obtain his discharge thereunder before he could get his discharge in the present bankruptcy. Mr. Street, representing creditors, asked for information respecting a quantity of timber on the premises, and Mr. Wreford said that it was claimed, subject to the payment of charges, by parties who had merely sent it for the purpose of being sawn. He was of opinion that the claim was a valid one. Mr. C. T. Lake, representing the debtor, said that Bryant, Powis, & Bryant (Limited), were the largest creditors, and a bankruptcy, with a committee of inspection, consisting of Mr. Goff (Messer & Co.), Mr. Cast, of Mildmay Grove, and Mr. Hofferberth.
BROWN, JOSEPH, builder, Northampton. —This case was before the Northampton Bankruptcy Court on the 2nd inst. The liabilities amounted to £1,403 3s. 1d., and the assets to £398 14s. 3d., less £51 15s. 5d. for preferential claims; deficiency £1,056 4s. 3d. Mr. F. Ellen represented the debtor, and Mr. J. Haviland (Howes, Percival, and Ellen) the debtor, who was examined by Mr. Haviland as to his losses between midsummer, 1885, and midsummer, 1886, amounting to £1,260, and he said they were caused by speculating in building work. He bought land and built houses. The debtor passed his public examination.
CUMING & CUMING, builders and contractors, Westminster Chambers, S.W., and Homerton Bridge.—The bankrupts recently applied for their discharge, and on Tuesday Mr. Registrar Linklater gave judgment. The failure occurred in December, 1885, the liabilities to unsecured creditors amounting to £4,652, and it appeared that nothing had been realised from the assets. His Honour, in dealing with the case, made some very important remarks upon the subject of speculative building, and we, therefore, report the judgment at length: It appears (his Honour said) that, in the case of each of these bankrupts, they commenced business about five years previous to the date of the receiving order as speculative builders, not as persons hoping to build to order, but simply as speculators, that is to say, acquiring land by some means or other and hoping by means of money which they hoped to borrow to be able to complete large operations from which, if they got as far as completion, they hoped to derive a large profit. They possess between them the sum of £200, and this constitutes the only means of their own on which for they can rely, everything else depending on the chance of their being able to borrow money from other people. Now, this being the nature of their business, they carry it on on a large scale. They undertake the building of a large number of houses and various buildings, not to order, but as pure speculations, and to such an extent did they carry this out, to such an extent did they indulge in speculation, that at one time they bought or acquired land on which they should have built 300 houses, not having at the time sufficient money to build one single house. The necessity of this kind of business is, of course, that money should be borrowed if possible, and some one who finances them will lend money for a time. I think he has been termed “the capitalist of themselves.” But these men have no money; they are always in want of more; and as soon as any property is created or acquired these men immediately mortgage it to the capitalist, in this particular case simply taking his statement as to the amount of consideration without inquiry. The necessary consequence is that they go on contracting debts to their unsecured creditors which they utterly fail to show they could have paid or have reasonably expected to be able to pay, and they go on with their business after they must have known they were insolvent. I cannot myself discover any time at which these men were solvent, except, perhaps, the very first moment when they started with their £200. They now found themselves in this court (not coming here like honest men at the first knowledge of difficulties, but having to be dragged here) with an actual deficiency of £4,500, and all their property in the hands of the capitalist, in whose favour they positively in five or six cases signed mortgages in
