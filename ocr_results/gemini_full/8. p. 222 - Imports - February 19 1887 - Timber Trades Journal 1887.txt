LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
IMPORTANT ACTION.
ATKINSON v. THE MIDLAND RAILWAY COMPANY.
AT Leeds, on Friday last, before Mr. Justice Cave and a special jury, the case of Atkinson v. the Midland Railway Company was heard. This was an action to recover damages for negligence. Mr. Waddy, Q.C., and Mr. Cyril Dodd appeared for the plaintiff; and the company were represented by Mr. Lockwood, Q.C., Mr. Forbes, and Mr. Whitaker Thompson. The plaintiff is a joiner and timber merchant, carrying on business at Bingley, and his timber yard is adjoining the Midland Railway Company's line between Bingley and Keighley. Mr. Atkinson left his premises safe on the evening of the 2nd of July. The company's trains are constantly passing, and the case for the plaintiff was that a number of burning cinders were, on the morning of the 3rd of July, emitted from one of the engines and fell upon his premises. The result was that a fire broke out, and did great damage to the premises and a large quantity of timber. The claim originally amounted to £2,164, but the only issue for the jury was the liability of the company, the learned Judge intimating that the amount of damages must, if necessary, be settled by an official referee. Evidence was called to show that the wind on the day in question was blowing in the direction of the plaintiff's premises from the company's line, but this was denied by the defendants. The case for the company was that, the spark arrester attached to the engine which was alleged to have been the cause of the fire was perfect; that an incline when passing the plaintiff's premises, steam had been shut off, and it was not likely that sparks and cinders would have been emitted. Further evidence was called to show that the fire broke out upon the plaintiff's premises before the train in question passed. It was further contended that even if the fire had been caused by sparks emitted from one of the company's engines, all reasonable precautions had been taken to prevent the emission of sparks and cinders, and that, therefore, the company could not be held liable. Evidence was given to the effect that the engine had been be properly worked with spark arrester. The learned Judge, in summing up the case, told the jury that if they came to the conclusion that the fire had been caused by sparks and cinders from the engine the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict if the company had not adopted the best known means to prevent the emission of sparks and cinders. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, adding the following rider:—“We are of opinion that the defendants have not used the best means for the prevention of sparks and burning cinders being emitted from their engines.”

FREIGHT AND SHORT DELIVERY.
THORESEN v. GRAHAM & CO.
MR. Lush-Wilson appeared in this case, on Saturday last, in the Queen's Bench Division, before Mr. Justice Cave and Mr. Baron Pollock, on behalf of the defendants, on appeal against an order made by Mr. Justice Field, at Chambers, refusing to allow them to amend the writ in the action by adding the name of one Donald as a co-defendant to the name of one Donald. The action is one brought to counter-claim for freight admittedly due by the defendants for freight, and the defendants plead a set-off and counter claim for short delivery of a certain number of logs which were alleged to have been shipped on board a Norwegian vessel belonging to the plaintiff—the Amsterdam, registered at Trondhjem—by one Donald, the plaintiff's captain at Mobile, and for which lading were English, as also the consignees. Under the contract between the defendant and Donald, the latter was to ship certain goods on plaintiff's ship, and they were to pay the freight in accordance with the terms of the charter-party entered into between himself and the plaintiff which they agreed to adopt. Since action brought, the defendants have obtained an assignment from Donald of the chose in action, in respect of which it is alleged that the plaintiff is liable to him, under sec. 25, sub-sec. 6, of the Judicature Act, 1873. Donald has made an affidavit, stating his willingness to be added as a co-defendant. The learned counsel admitted that he could produce no authority for his contention that the writ ought to be amended by adding the name of Donald as a co-defendant, but he submitted that the matter was one clearly in the discretion of the Court, the case of “Norris v. Beazley” (2, C. P. Div., 80) only having decided that, under the circumstances then
