A New Timber Company.
The Ottawa Citizen of March 12th announces that a scheme is on foot to form a company for the purpose of purchasing the saw-mills at the Chaudiere and Hull, as well as the major portion of the timber limits on the Ottawa and Gatineau Rivers. The moving spirit in the matter is Mr. John Mather, a shrewd business man, who has managed the business of Messrs. Gilmour and Co. in this district for many years. It is said that his visit to Europe last summer was in connection with the scheme, and that while there the speculation was presented in such a favourable light that he experienced no difficulty in forming a company with a capital of twenty-five millions of dollars. Among the members of the company it is understood that the name of Sir John Rose figures prominently. The speculation is certainly a large one, and the introduction of that amount of money into the Ottawa Valley will brighten the future prospects of the city. It is reasonable to suppose that after disposing of their milling establishments and limits, the lumber kings will seek a new field for investment. With the great mineral wealth that surrounds us on every side, and which requires but capital to work and make it yield excellent returns, it is only natural to suppose that a large proportion of the capital realized by the sale will be utilized in the development of these resources.
It is understood that the company are now negotiating for the purchase of Messrs. Gilmour and Co.'s mills, below Hull, and also for three thousand square miles of limits. Arrangements had been almost completed previous to the unfortunate disappearance of Mr. John Gilmour, since which time it is said no action has been taken.

NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," March 24th.)
Our wholesale market has become rather dull again, and we find little of positive interest to advise for the current week. There is more or less call to fill shipping orders, both old and new, but nothing of magnitude. The home demand does not come up to the promises of a week or two ago, and the feeling of disappointment to which we referred in our last seems to spread a little. It is probable, however, that a great many dealers have been calculating upon a too rapid and extensive recuperation, which would naturally give any check to business a serious look. The position, however, is not without encouraging features, among which may be noted the absence of decided backward turn on values, a considerably reduced and therefore more easily managed stock of desirable goods against any demand springing up, and the prospect that weather to come will be more propitious for business than that recently passed. No one talks of very high prices this year, as it has been repeatedly proved that consumption can only be stimulated by an easy range of values, while the late snows have pretty effectually dissipated any fears which may have previously been entertained regarding a short crop of logs.

THE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 409
CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," March 22nd.)
A still further reduction of the sales to interior operators has been experienced by the lumbermen in this city during the week just ending, owing to about the same causes that for the last two or three weeks have restricted their volume. Several fresh snowstorms since our last report have prevented any improvement in the condition of the streets and roads, and therefore no increase has been noticeable in the demand from builders in the city and suburbs. Altogether the market has been comparatively quiet. The dealers seem generally to anticipate a good demand for their stocks during the season, and almost unanimously talk of better times as something to be expected in the near future. Our monthly report of stocks held in the yards of this city on the 1st inst., shows that during the month of February 54,843,414 feet of pine lumber was disposed of in this market, reducing the quantity on hand to 290,077,843 feet. Comparing this amount with the stock on hand on the same date last year, we find an increase of 15,975,540. The general impression in regard to our supply is that it is not excessive, and that there will be no trouble experienced in disposing of it.

THE SAGINAW VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman's Gazette," March 21st.)
The past week has been the most successful one of the winter for jobbers, so far as the amount of stock banked is concerned. Two weeks ago the declaration was, "I fear we are not going to have logs enough," while to-day the tune is changed to "I fear we are going to have too many." Still active work continues in all parts of the State, with roads in good condition and fair prospects for a full week's hauling yet before the snow can be melted away. There is no doubt but that the State of Michigan will secure a full average stock, while in some cases the estimates of last fall will be realized. Were it not for the fact that the pleasant weather of February had the effect of lessening the supply that would have otherwise gone upon the skids, much more would have found its way to the streams and mills to operate with damaging effect upon the production of the country. It is quite generally believed that logs will be no higher than last season, and buyers are now only holding off to learn how much, if any, they can be purchased at. Good judges say that they are held at from 75 cents. to $1 per thousand lower than they were ten days ago. The same condition of affairs prevails in other portions of the State, and it will be some days yet before stocks find their level so that buyers and sellers will know how to negotiate intelligently.

THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
(From the "Lumberman and Manufacturer," March 22nd.)
The fair promises of last month are melting away, and it would appear as though, in spite of the favouring circumstances and weather, that the trade is to be loaded down "to the guards" again with lumber in '77. The news from Michigan found in our columns shows that abundant snows have reached that State, and that they will approximate the cut of last year, while all across the country from there to the head of the Mississippi a heavy per cent. of the loggers are busy putting in logs, yet at the increased expense occasioned by a lack of snow. We are reluctantly forced to the conclusion that another year of low prices in logs and lumber is likely to ensue, and to express the hope that the burden may fall heaviest upon that branch of the trade most responsible for this condition of things. As it is, we feel certain that millions of feet of valuable stumpage is being cut which will never net the low western valuation of the standing timber, much less a margin to the operator.
