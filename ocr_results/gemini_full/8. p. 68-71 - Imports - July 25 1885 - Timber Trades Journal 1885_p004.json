The statement of affairs shows liabilities to unsecured creditors £448 13s. 9d., to fully secured creditors £1,800, the value of securities being estimated at £2,000, thus leaving £200 to be carried to contra, and other liabilities £25; thus making total liabilities £473 13s. 9d., against assets as follows:—Stock-in-trade estimated to produce £90, book debts (good) £8 4s., doubtful £66 13s. (estimated to realize £30), household furniture £10, and surplus from securities in hands of creditors fully secured £200, making a total of £338 4s., from which £56 4s. 1d. has to be deducted for preferential creditors, thus leaving £281 19s. 11d. as net assets, and showing a deficiency of £191 13s. 10d.

The statement of affairs showed liabilities to unsecured creditors £1,085 18s. 10d., and to fully secured creditors £250. The assets were estimated to produce £210 11s. 6d., thus showing a deficiency of £875 7s. 4d. The debtors commenced business in partnership in 1881, with a capital of £100. They attribute their failure to badness of trade, want of capital, and bad debts.

The Judge having dealt with the legal points and decisions given on the matter, said he had to give judgment for the holder of the bill of sale, with costs against the trustee, to come out of the estate. He said this was one of...\n\n71\nthose rare cases in which there would be nearly a fund for all the creditors. Mr. Coates appeared for the bill of sale holders, and Mr. G. W. King for the trustee, Mr. W. W. Slade, timber merchant, Southsea.\n\nW. T. BROADBRIDGE.—At the Hastings County Court on Monday, before Registrar Young, this bankrupt, who was a builder at Bexhill, attended for his adjourned public examination. Mr. Glenister (solicitor) appeared for the Official Receiver, and questioned debtor at great length in reference to the building of some houses at Bexhill, for Mr. Alfred Richardson (County Court clerk). It appears that he built two houses for £130 each and then eight more for £130 each. The examination tended to show that there were substantial deviations from the plans of the first two in building the eight houses, and the surveyor told him he could not build the houses for the money. Mr. Richardson said he would make it right when he found he had lost money he expected Mr. Richardson, as \"the gentleman he always took him for,\" would give him something extra. Mr. Kay (a creditor) also put in some questions, and insinuated that certain things were wilfully concealed from the bankrupt, who was really not a builder but a painter. The examination was ordered to be adjourned.\n\nHENRY PENFOLD, builder, St. Andrew's Cottage, West Wickham, Kent.—A receiving order was made in this case on the petition of Messrs. Chambers, Monnery, & Co., of 41, Bishopsgate Street, E.C., on the 26th June, and the first meeting of creditors was held at the offices of the Official Receiver, Mr. Cecil Mercer, 109, Victoria Street, Westminster, on Friday, the 17th inst., Mr. Mercer occupying the chair. The debtor, Henry Penfold, otherwise known as Noah Henry Penfold, commenced business about ten years ago, but has only been engaged as a builder since August, 1884. In 1882 he compounded with his creditors, and since that date the debtor states that he has kept no books. The statement of affairs filed shows debts due to unsecured creditors £791 9s. 6d., to creditors fully secured £1,586 13s. 9d., and the value of their securities is estimated at £2,170, thus leaving a surplus of £583 6s. 9d. to be carried to contra, to creditors partly secured £107 9s. 6d., and payable in full £88 7s. The assets consist solely of the surplus in the hands of creditors fully secured, and after deducting preferential claims leave net assets at £494 19s. 3d., thus showing a deficiency of £266 10s. 3d. The debtor accounts for his deficiency by his being unable to sell his houses. Legal proceedings have been instituted by several of the creditors to recover their debts, and the debtor's goods were seized, and sold under an execution at the beginning of the year. Nothing could be done at the meeting, as there was not a quorum. The debtor was therefore, adjudicated a bankrupt, the Official Receiver, Mr. Mercer, being trustee. The public examination is fixed for the 31st July.

TILLETT.—A meeting for public examination was held before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt, on Tuesday, under the failure of Benjamin Tillett, of Natal House, Bulwer Road, Leytonstone, builder, whose statement of affairs showed liabilities to the amount of £4,083, and debts fully secured £13,470; assets £433. Upon examination by the Official Solicitor, the debtor stated that he began business as a builder, about sixteen years ago, without any capital. He failed about two years afterwards, and he believed that his debts were paid under an assignment, which he executed for the benefit of his creditors; he only owed £300 or £400. He kept no books, but all his moneys were paid under the exception of small sums, to his banking account. He was solvent three...",
