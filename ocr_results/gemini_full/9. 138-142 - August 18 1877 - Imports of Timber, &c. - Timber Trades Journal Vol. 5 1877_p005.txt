NEW YORK.
(From the "Real Estate Record," August 4th.)
Stock offered by cargo on open market at the moment would not receive much attention unless quality was extra attractive, and even possessing this qualification it would require but a small amount to form a surplus accumulation. Buyers, however, are fairly interested in negotiating upon special schedules, and in this way some of our agents appear to be doing a fair business in both eastern and southern stuff. For the northern and western product there is also an occasional market to be found, but offerings are plentiful, and buyers feel under no necessity for hurrying themselves. The primary markets generally appear to be dull, and most reports frankly admit the situation, and also own to the probability that there will be supplies enough and to spare, so far as present indications are concerned, but here and there old habits will assert themselves, and a short crop of logs claimed form basis for a prediction of higher prices to come. The short crop of logs appears to be entirely overlooked, and until general consumption of lumber increases there will not be much basis for a solid advance. The export demand at the moment is moderate and without features of interest.

CHICAGO.
(From the "North-western Lumberman," July 26th.)
Considering all the circumstances in the case, the condition of the market here is inexplicably discouraging. Said an old operator, "This thing beats all my experience. I did think that by this time we should have had a decent demand, even if prices were not advanced; but even that is light now."
As to prices, no changes are apparent, and the same may be said of freights. The present seems to be a general period of waiting for some-thing to turn up, every one relying on his neighbour to do the turning. Some operators, however, are shrewd enough to make no effort to sell lumber at present prices, unless absolutely compelled to, and they are pretty well satisfied that another thirty days will see piece-stuff selling at $8 if not $8.50.
