August 2.—Athalia for London; Waterford for London; Zurich for Newcastle; Eleanor for Liverpool; Barber for Aberdeen. August 4.—Azilla for London; James Kitchen for Stranraer; Herlof Herlofsen for London; Solertia for London; Manitoban for Alice, Brevig, and Queen of England for Granton; Charmer for Sunderland; for Dundee.\n\n(From the Ottawa Citizen.)\n\nOTTAWA, July 4th.—The Dominion Timber and Lumber Association met to-day and elected officers for the ensuing year. They passed a resolution urging a reduction of 50 per cent. on lumber operations next year compared with last.\n\nBaldwin's Mill at the Chaudière closed operations to-day. The want of saw-logs is said to be the cause.\n\nOTTAWA, 29th.—There has not been a sale of lumber reported at the Chaudière this week, and as far as we can ascertain there are no inquiries.\n\nWM. HENDERSON, the well-known lumber merchant of Montreal, has, by the advice of his creditors, made an assignment to Tyne and Falton, assignees.\n\nWESTERN LUMBER TRADE.—Advices from Wisconsin and Michigan indicate a firmer feeling in the market. Saginaw reports that prices are growing more firm, with an upward tendency.\n\nWISCONSIN LUMBERING.—The position and prospects of the lumber trade in Wisconsin is in no wise better apparently than in other parts of the country. Under date of July 23 a correspondent writes as follows :—“ We are manufacturing between three and four millions this year, our mill capacity being six millions. We cannot help thinking that in price lumber has touched bottom, is down to hard pan. We are now realizing nothing more than a fair stumpage, and any further reduction in price must bring a positive loss in our stock in the rough.”—Lumberman's Gazette.\n\n(From Mr. J. L. Woodworth's Circular.)\n\nST. JOHN, N.B., July 31st.—Our freight market has been rather quiet this week; it is very firm, however, and quotations fully maintained. The following deal charters are reported :—Berteaur, 1022, Bristol Channel, 76s. 3d., c. d. ; Two Marys, 204, Dublin, 75s., c. d. ; Benson, 327, direct port East Coast Ireland, 76s. 3d. ; Minnie Cameron, 436, Richibucto to Liverpool, 80s., c. d.\n\nLATEST CLEARANCES, from July 24th to 30th.—Alice, Penzance; Ceres and N.S. Colymore, Dublin; Sokoto, Sunlight, and Queen of the North, Liverpool; Pathfinder, Dundalk; Charles Cox, Dublin.\n\nA HUGE wooden hotel, ten stories high, and containing a thousand double-bedded rooms, is to be erected in Philadelphia to accommodate Centennial visitors.\n\nTO TEST THE SOUNDNESS of a piece of timber, apply the ear to the middle of one of the ends, while another person strikes upon the opposite extremity. If the wood is sound and of good quality, the blow is very distinctly heard, however long the beam may be. If the wood is disaggregated by decay or otherwise, the sound will be for the most part destroyed.\n\nA TIMBER RAFT covering twenty acres of surface and containing 3,460,000 feet of timber, broke up against the International Bridge of the Niagara river a little time ago, and went to pieces. About a million feet of timber lodged on the head of Grand Island. Much of the remainder went over the falls.\n\nIMPORTS OF TIMBER, &c.\n\nLONDON.—From Aug. 5th to 19th.\n\nTimber, Deals, &c.—Eva Parker @ Miramichi,—663 deals and ends, Robinson Fleming & Co.
