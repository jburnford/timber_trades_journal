Curiosities in Wood Culture.
No. I.—THE TIMBER BADGES OF THE SCOTTISH CLANS.
SCOTLAND in the olden times is generally thought of as only peopled by a cluster of clans or peoples descended from a common ancestor, dwelling in close contiguity, and banded together not only for defence and defiance, but for predatory and savage habits, we fancy to ourselves as tribes, septs, and races which
“Around the flag
Of each his faction, in their several clans,
Light armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,
Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands.”
Perhaps a more correct idea of a Scottish clan would be to regard it as a body of persons nearly related by ties of consanguinity to a common progenitor, whom they held in patriarchial reverence, and to whose authority they submitted as a just obedience to one who by the right of primogeniture had acquired the privilege of a ruler. However, this may be we need not here greatly concern ourselves, as our design is not to treat of the social savagery of the Scottish clans, but to strive to gather from the badges of their tribes some guess at the state of Scotland in regard to timber while the clans were at their strongest. The head of each clan was its representative man—a man generally of rank and substance, personal respectability, and accepted by the court as a security for the good conduct of the race who stood in relationship of responsibility, and to whom he appeared as entitled to claim unquestioning obedience. The clans were as a general rule topographically separated from each other, and their members were severally aggregated together under distinctive names, and bore, as a sign of their clan-kinship, certain well-known badges, which marked them off one from another and made them conspicuous in foray or fight, at market and fair, wapenshaw or social gathering. These badges, however, appear to us to yield a farther thought than has as yet been gained from them. They seem to us to afford some gauge of prevalence and distribution of timber in “stern Caledonia.” In this aspect the few memoranda here jotted down may help to give interest if not value to a page of The Timber Trades’ Journal, which seeks to bring from all quarters and regions such contributions as may add to the progress, permanency, prosperity, and pleasure of those who are engaged in the culture, sale, or manufacture of wood.
It is quite true that at first sight people do not give ready credence to the idea that Scotland can have been in the olden time a richly various and thick-wooded country. There are of course traces and many traditions regarding these forests and their frequenters in it, and poetry have made use of these where they could, and have made the districts of them famous. But we think that in the badges of the clans we have a clear, age-hallowed, and unexceptionable evidence of the extensiveness and variousness of the timber formerly prevalent in “Old Scotland.” At any rate, the following few notes, even though failing to prove all that is claimed for them, may bring to many a little entertainment and some information, and may even prove that the associations of the Timber Trades are not as dry as sawdust, and as inflexible as deals.
Most people, on recollecting that George Buchanan, the historian of Scotland, as well as the reformer, dramatist, satirist, and psalmist, of his age, acted as pedagogue to King James I. of England and VI. of Scotland, and was known to have smartly afflicted the breech of his royal pupil, could easily bring the idea of the birch into close association with that of Buchanan. But it is a singular fact that the birch is the distinguishing mark of the clan Buchanan, and forms the special sign of that section of the early Scottish races.
