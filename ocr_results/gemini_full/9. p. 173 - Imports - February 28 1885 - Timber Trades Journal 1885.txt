LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
COMPENSATION CLAIM.
LITTLE v. M'NEILL.
In the Court of Exchequer, Dublin, on Monday last, before the Lord Chief Baron, Mr. Baron Dowse, and Mr. Justice Andrews, in a cause Little v. M'Neill, Mr. Dane for the defendants, Messrs. M'Neill, sen. and jun., moved that the action be remitted for trial by the County Court Judge of Fermanagh.
The defendants are the proprietors of sawmills in Enniskillen, and the plaintiff, a farmer and carpenter, sought damages for personal injuries occasioned by alleged negligence on their part. On the 8th of January the plaintiff brought a quantity of timber to the defendants' mill to have it cut into lengths for wheel spokes. While that operation was being performed, a piece of wood flew from the circular saw, struck against a workman, and, rebounding, hit the plaintiff on the arm, breaking the bone. It was alleged that the defendant's foreman told the plaintiff to stand back from the saw, but that he did not do so.
Mr. Hart, for the plaintiff, opposed the motion, and stated that his client held a farm at £6 8s. a year.
The Court granted the motion.

—"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately flavoured beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame."—Civil Service Gazette.—Made simply with boiling water or milk.
