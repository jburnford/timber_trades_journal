  "text": "AUGUST 27, 1887.\n\nTHE ENGLISH TIMBER TRADE.\nWEST RIDING, YORKS.\n\nSINCE our last report there has been, we really think, some little improvement in the turnover of home-grown timber in this part of the country, notwithstanding the unpleasant disturbance which has occurred between the directors of the Midland Railway and their engine drivers, and which at one time threatened to interfere seriously with the traffic upon one of the principal lines through the West Riding of the county of York.\nIn addition to this, the prolonged and almost unprecedented drought has reduced the water of the Leeds and Liverpool canal so much that traffic thereon has been greatly retarded—indeed, in some parts suspended—and goods have had to be transferred from boat to rail, we understand, to secure delivery at their destination; however, in spite of these drawbacks, we are glad to note more encouraging signs of improved trade than we have observed for months past, and which we can only hope will be permanent.\nConsiderable activity has also been manifest with regard to the import trade in timber, the arrivals from the Baltic and other northern ports delivering now more frequently and in increased quantities; of these our attention has been directed more particularly to several consignments of Russian birch and alder.\nThe former we have commented upon in an earlier report, and with regard to the latter, we can observe that so far the arrivals have been mostly clean and straight, and as sound as one could desire, but the sizes are running at present much smaller than last year's shipments, the average dimensions being not more than 7 in. quarter-girth.\nSmaller wood of this kind, say from 4 in. top and upwards, we have seen quoted at 1s. 1½d. per load, free on trucks at the port.\nBoth English and Irish beech has come forward pretty freely since we last wrote.\nOnly last week we saw several sets of very fine, well-grown English beech of prime quality, delivering at one of the railway stations in this locality, and showing a quarter-girth of from 9 to 18 in., the price realised for which was 1s. 1½d. per foot, the highest figure we have met with lately.\nHowever, from the class of timber supplied, we should consider it fairly good value at the price.\nOther consignments of similar wood, but of inferior size and quality, were fetching from 1s. to 1s. 1d. per foot delivered.\nIrish beech is again been offering in moderate quantities, and in some instances we have met with rather prices, 1s. to 2s. per ton more being asked; any advance, however, at present we think, altogether out of the question, and we have not met with any instance where business has resulted at enhanced rates; in fact, we have no reason to anticipate any improvement in the price of beech for this season at least, unless some marvellous change takes place in the trade of the country.\nConspicuous amongst the various sorts of timber offering during the past few weeks we have met with unusual quantities of large parcel of small, clean, and straight ash, running from 3 in. to 4½ in. quarter-girth, and quoted at 1s. per foot delivered, whilst some small wood of the same class, measuring say 3½ in. to 4½ in. quarter-girth, we have met with at 31s. 6d. per load f.o. trucks at port.\nPart elm and ash we have observed at some of the wayside stations in small parcels, but the demand for the former continues altogether different, and prices, in consequence, cannot be improved for the present.\nIn ash the demand appears steady and regular, and good stuff can generally find a profitable market.\nIrish ash, say 6 to 9 in. quarter-girth, we heard quoted a short time ago at 60s. per ton at a port on this side St. George's Channel.\nFor oak we do not meet with much inquiry.\nSome hedgerow timber, say 20 ft. average, hearty and sound, we noticed offering not long ago, but whether a sale was effected we have not learned at the hour of writing.\nIn the sycamore trade there continues a considerable amount of dulness, and washing machine makers have at present no pressure of orders, we believe, on their books.\nStocks of roller wood have also pretty well accumulated in many of the yards, and, if we are rightly informed, some fair lines have been placed recently for American maple blocks.\nSmaller sycamore, 5 to 11 in. quarter-girth, continues to come forward in moderate quantities, and several parcels have found a market at 1s. and 1s. 1d. per foot delivered.\nWe may add that tenders were invited up to last Thursday (25th inst) for a quantity of felled timber near Helmsley, in the adjoining Riding, and consisting mainly of 274 oak trees and 246 ash trees, said to be all of good quality, tough, and clean.\nThe saw-mills, so far as we can learn, are rather better employed, generally, than when we reported last.\n\nLONDON DOCK DELIVERIES.\nDeliveries at the Docks for the week ending August 20th, 1887, compared with the corresponding period of 1886, and also for the thirty-three weeks ending August 20th, compared with the corresponding period of 1886.\nSURREY COMMERCIAL DOCKS.\n1887. 1886.\nstds. stds.\nDeals from stock ... ... 2,568 2,942\nPrepared boards ... ... 666 641\nTotal 3,234 3,583\nDeals from ship direct to craft for storage elsewhere than at the docks ... 1,241 1,127\nPrepared boards ... ... 125 —\nTotal 4,600 4,710\nFloated timber ... loads 544 1,272\n\nMILLWALL DOCKS.\n1887. 1886.\nstds. stds.\nDeals from stock ... ... 729 271\nPrepared boards ... ... 28 11\nTotal 757 282\nDeals from ship direct to craft for storage elsewhere than at the docks ... 350 395\nPrepared boards ... ... — 80\nTotal 1,107 757\n\nDELIVERIES FROM BOTH DOCKS\nFOR THE WEEK ENDING AUGUST 20TH.\n1887. 1886.\nstds. stds.\nDeals ... ... ... 4,888 4,735\nPrepared boards ... ... 819 732\nTotal 5,707 5,467\nFloated timber ... loads 544 1,272\nFOR THE THIRTY-THREE WEEKS END.
