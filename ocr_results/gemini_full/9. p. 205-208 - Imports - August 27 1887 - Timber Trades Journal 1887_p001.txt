AUGUST 27, 1887.

THE ENGLISH TIMBER TRADE.
WEST RIDING, YORKS.

SINCE our last report there has been, we really think, some little improvement in the turnover of home-grown timber in this part of the country, notwithstanding the unpleasant disturbance which has occurred between the directors of the Midland Railway and their engine drivers, and which at one time threatened to interfere seriously with the traffic upon one of the principal lines through the West Riding of the county of York.
In addition to this, the prolonged and almost unprecedented drought has reduced the water of the Leeds and Liverpool canal so much that traffic thereon has been greatly retarded—indeed, in some parts suspended—and goods have had to be transferred from boat to rail, we understand, to secure delivery at their destination; however, in spite of these drawbacks, we are glad to note more encouraging signs of improved trade than we have observed for months past, and which we can only hope will be permanent.
Considerable activity has also been manifest with regard to the import trade in timber, the arrivals from the Baltic and other northern ports delivering now more frequently and in increased quantities; of these our attention has been directed more particularly to several consignments of Russian birch and alder.
The former we have commented upon in an earlier report, and with regard to the latter, we can observe that so far the arrivals have been mostly clean and straight, and as sound as one could desire, but the sizes are running at present much smaller than last year's shipments, the average dimensions being not more than 7 in. quarter-girth.
Smaller wood of this kind, say from 4 in. top and upwards, we have seen quoted at 1s. 1½d. per load, free on trucks at the port.
Both English and Irish beech has come forward pretty freely since we last wrote.
Only last week we saw several sets of very fine, well-grown English beech of prime quality, delivering at one of the railway stations in this locality, and showing a quarter-girth of from 9 to 18 in., the price realised for which was 1s. 1½d. per foot, the highest figure we have met with lately.
However, from the class of timber supplied, we should consider it fairly good value at the price.
Other consignments of similar wood, but of inferior size and quality, were fetching from 1s. to 1s. 1d. per foot delivered.
Irish beech is again been offering in moderate quantities, and in some instances we have met with rather prices, 1s. to 2s. per ton more being asked; any advance, however, at present we think, altogether out of the question, and we have not met with any instance where business has resulted at enhanced rates; in fact, we have no reason to anticipate any improvement in the price of beech for this season at least, unless some marvellous change takes place in the trade of the country.
Conspicuous amongst the various sorts of timber offering during the past few weeks we have met with unusual quantities of large parcel of small, clean, and straight ash, running from 3 in. to 4½ in. quarter-girth, and quoted at 1s. per foot delivered, whilst some small wood of the same class, measuring say 3½ in. to 4½ in. quarter-girth, we have met with at 31s. 6d. per load f.o. trucks at port.
Part elm and ash we have observed at some of the wayside stations in small parcels, but the demand for the former continues altogether different, and prices, in consequence, cannot be improved for the present.
In ash the demand appears steady and regular, and good stuff can generally find a profitable market.
Irish ash, say 6 to 9 in. quarter-girth, we heard quoted a short time ago at 60s. per ton at a port on this side St. George's Channel.
For oak we do not meet with much inquiry.
Some hedgerow timber, say 20 ft. average, hearty and sound, we noticed offering not long ago, but whether a sale was effected we have not learned at the hour of writing.
In the sycamore trade there continues a considerable amount of dulness, and washing machine makers have at present no pressure of orders, we believe, on their books.
Stocks of roller wood have also pretty well accumulated in many of the yards, and, if we are rightly informed, some fair lines have been placed recently for American maple blocks.
Smaller sycamore, 5 to 11 in. quarter-girth, continues to come forward in moderate quantities, and several parcels have found a market at 1s. and 1s. 1d. per foot delivered.
We may add that tenders were invited up to last Thursday (25th inst) for a quantity of felled timber near Helmsley, in the adjoining Riding, and consisting mainly of 274 oak trees and 246 ash trees, said to be all of good quality, tough, and clean.
The saw-mills, so far as we can learn, are rather better employed, generally, than when we reported last.

REGISTRATION OF CANAL BOATS.—The Local Government Board, under section 7 of the Canal Boats Act, 1877, have constituted the Corporation of the City of London, who are the sanitary authority of the Port of London, as a registration authority for the river Thames, the Grand Surrey Canal, and the Regent's Canal.
The previous registration authorities had no water jurisdiction and no means of locomotion afloat, and they had to require craft to come to certain fixed points, whereby loss of time was involved.
Dr. Collingridge, the medical officer of health for the port, has undertaken to carry out the registration, the necessity of which he had commented on in his reports to the Corporation, as having a considerable importance in its bearing on the notification of infectious diseases.
