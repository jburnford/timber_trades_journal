PRACTICAL NOTES.
[Our Readers are invited to avail themselves of this column both to ask questions on all matters connected with saw-mill and building machinery and materials, and also to impart information by replying to the questions asked. Questions are given one week and the answers to them in the following issue.]

QUESTIONS.
Bricks Made of Waste Slate, &c.—I am informed that a new process for making bricks from waste slate has latterly been introduced, and that they are extremely compact and strong. Can you afford me any information as to the process, and what do you consider the best form of brick moulding machine?—E. MARSDEN

Wood Chisels.—I noticed in your paper a notice of Mr. Wood, warning against imitations of his chisels. I should be glad if any of your readers could inform me if there is a patent for called imitation chisels, and, if so, in what the patent consists, and if I can be forced not to use any self-carving chisel except with Wood’s name. I may mention that I have a set of these so-called imitation chisels in use, and find them in every respect as good and the cost about one-half.—J. S.

ANSWER.
Band Saws for Breaking Down Heavy Timber.—The advantage of band saws is that they are thinner, and, consequently, waste less timber, and want a smaller power to drive. Their chief disadvantage is that they are not portable, and the initial cost would be more. For ordinary forest work, the rack bench has much to commend it. It is no secret that it carries a heavy kerf, and consumes timber and power, when the cuts are deep and the saws of necessity large; but, on the other hand, its portability is a great factor in its favour. The killing part of timber conversion too often is the cost of transport from the place where it grows to the saw. With fixed mills there is no means of lessening this with portable mills there is. Whether a band saw, or a rack bench is to be preferred will, therefore depend on circumstances. If a mill is so situated that it can command a large timber supply in its immediate neighbourhood, there is certainly a chance of saving in timber and engine power by employing a good band saw. If the supply is scattered, a good deal could be saved in cartage by an occasional removal. Nothing will beat the portable rack bench.—QUERCUS.

BUILDING NEWS.
Additions and alterations are to be made to the Elgin Lunatic Asylum.
A mill, with engine-house, &c., is to be erected at Halifax.
An infectious diseases hospital is to be constructed at Heathcote, Warwick.
A hospital containing 24 beds is to be erected at West Ham, the cost of which is not to exceed £4,000.
A girls’ school and detached house in connection therewith are to be built at Shipton, Yorks.
The following is a list of the names of firms which have been successful in securing contracts for building, engineering, and other work in which timber will be largely used.

AUGUST 27, 1887.
Further, that his building agreements were unsuccessful, chiefly in consequence of actions in respect of “Ancient Lights,” and particularly in the case of his works at Paddington Fields (possession whereof was taken by the freeholder in April last), and to this circumstance which he mainly attributes his failure. The Official Receiver considers that the freehold property is not likely to realise the amount at which it is estimated by the debtor. The accounts show: unsecured creditors, £3,343 14s. 5d., and debts fully secured £108, against assets (surplus from securities) £2,490 5s., leaving a deficiency of £853 9s. 5d.

No offer was made, and the proceedings resulted in bankruptcy, Mr. A. L. Lewis, accountant, 28, King Street, Cheapside, being appointed trustee of the estate, together with a committee of inspection.

DART, CHAS., builder, late of Saltash, now of Camel’s Head, Devonport.—The order for the public examination of this debtor was held at Plymouth on Friday, before the Registrar Edmonds. Mr. J. Graves represented the debtor. The Official Receiver (Mr. Greenway) applied to have the case adjourned in order that debtor might submit a goods and cash account. An adjournment for four weeks was accordingly granted.

GILL, G. T., timber merchant and builder, Spencer Street, Limehouse, E.—The receiving order in this case was made on July 14th, the debtor trading under the style of George Gill, and the accounts which he has filed show unsecured liabilities £1,357 4s. 3d.; debts fully secured £8,240; a debt partly secured £312 (value of security £312); and liabilities on bills discounted and not expected to rank £108 13s. 4d., total expected to rank £1,445 4s. 3d.; assets (including surplus from securities £3,656), estimated at £4,201 15s. 3d.; or a surplus, subject to realisation, of £2,756 11s. The debtor states that he commenced business in 1879 with £1,500 capital. He attributes his failure to inability to sell his house properties to advantage, and to the outgoings in respect thereof having been in excess of the rents received during the last eighteen months. The security held by creditors is stated to consist of mortgages of various freehold and shops at Albert Docks, valued by the debtor together at £8,656, a mortgage of certain leasehold building land and houses at Plaistow and Plashet, estimated by him together at worth £2,200, and a deposit of the sub-lease of his business premises, estimated at £400. It would appear (observes the Official Receiver) that not more than about £800 is likely to be realised from the estimated surplus of £3,656 from such securities. The security held by a creditor treated as partly secured is stated to be a mortgage of two houses in Manchester Road, Poplar, the value of which is estimated by the debtor at £312. The stock, plant, and machinery have been valued at £329 12s., and the household furniture (less excepted articles) at £256 7s. The following are scheduled as creditors:—
