Raspberry Jam Wood (Acacia acuminata).
—This is a dark, reddish-brown wood, close-grained, hard, and having a fragrant scent, from which it derives its name. The tree, which is small, abounds in extra tropic Western Australia; it is easily worked by machinery, and leaves the cutters with a very smooth surface, and as it takes a fine polish, and can be purchased in this country at the price of 3s. 6d. per cubic foot, it should find a ready sale among cabinet-makers and others interested in ornamental woodwork.

NEW ZEALAND.
Kauri Pine (Dammara australis).—This is undoubtedly the very best of all soft woods, and it is a marvel that it has not been more largely introduced into this country. It is found only in the province of Auckland, where the trees attain a large size, being frequently over 120 ft. in height, with a circumference at the base of 45 ft. It is remarkably straight-grained, and boards of any width and length can be obtained from it without a knot.
Although a much stronger wood than yellow pine of Canada, the kauri can be worked with equal ease, and its wonderful durability is proved by the fact that a hut erected on a cliff near Auckland by one of the early settlers in 1841 is still standing and in good repair, although it has been exposed to hot suns and beating rains for nearly half a century. A weatherboard from this hut was shown at the exhibition last year, and is still perfectly sound.
Another useful feature in kauri timber is that the end grain, when planed off smooth, never rises, and, as it swells very slightly when exposed to moisture, it is eminently suited for engineers' patterns; in fact, kauri in all respects offers such great advantages over the best yellow Canadian pine, which has hitherto been almost exclusively used for pattern-making, that I have decided to adopt it in my own works for that purpose, the more so as, strange as it may appear, kauri can at present be bought at a lower price than best yellow pine in the London market. The door, mouldings, and matchboarding made from this timber, which are exhibited, clearly show its suitability for all descriptions of joiners' work, while the cask, made from the same wood, proves that it can be used to advantage in coopers' work.
Kauri is used very largely in New Zealand and Australia, where it is much esteemed for flooring and deck planks, and it is estimated that, at the rate at which it is being felled, it will become entirely extinct in twenty-five years. It is therefore certain that if a demand arises for it in this country, the present low price of 3s. per cubic foot, at which it has lately been sold at the docks, will not long be maintained.
Black Pine (Podocarpus spicata).—This wood, which is also known in the colony as "matai," is somewhat hard for a pine, but is used extensively in the district where it grows for housebuilding and joiners' work, and although it cannot be compared in quality to the kauri pine, it is a good serviceable wood for that purpose.
Red Pine, or Rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum).
—This is very similar to the black pine last described, and, like it, is used for joiners' and carpenters' work, the better logs being also used for cabinet-making. Pieces of both red and black pine were converted into mouldings, matchboarding, and framing, and, although the surface produced on both woods was good.

CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.
Upright Yellow-wood (Podocarpus latifolius).
—This wood, which is plentiful in the forests of George, Knysna, and Amatola, is of a light yellow or straw colour, with an even grain, and much esteemed in the colony for coach-building, joiners' work, and bedroom furniture. Although the tree attains an average height of 75 ft. with a diameter of more than 20 ft. high. The wood is of a close texture, and works like mild lance wood, leaving the cutters with a remarkably clean surface, but the demand for it in the colony and the cost of transit for it in the colony would preclude its being imported into this country at a price which would pay, excepting for the highest class of joiners' work, for which it is well suited. A four-panel door and some circular and straight mouldings and matchboarding are exhibited to show the results of the trials in this wood.

BRITISH NORTH BORNEO.
The virgin forests of British North Borneo abound in a variety of timbers of great size and value, and as they are situated conveniently for the port of Sandakan, where they can be delivered on board ship at exceedingly low rates, it is probable that ere long they will be largely used in this country, where, in spite

of the long sea route, they will be able to compete favourably with some of the woods which we now import from other countries. Among the more valuable woods of North Borneo are :—
Billian, or Borneo Ironwood.—This is a heavy, hard, and durable wood of a dark sand colour, which, when seasoned, turns to a deep red, and with long exposure becomes as black as ebony. It bears exposure well, resists the teredo and white ant, and seems almost indestructible. It is said that the Chinese and natives of Borneo prefer this wood to any other for almost all purposes; and it is invaluable for sleepers, beams, piles, and indeed for any description of heavy construction on land or water. The wood, although hard, is easily worked by machinery, and during the trials sleepers were sawn out, the rail seatings planed, and the spike holes bored, while other portions of the log were cut into scantlings, and mortised and tenoned together; and mouldings and matchboarding were run with a feed of 30 ft. a minute.
The result of seasoning a piece of billian 18 in. long by 4½ in. wide by 1¾ in. thick, by submitting it for 144 hours to the cool air drying process, was that, although it lost 6 ozs. in weight, it was not perceptibly reduced in either width or thickness, and it neither split nor warped during the operation.
As this timber can be delivered on board ship in Sandakan harbour for £4 a load of 50 cubic feet, it can be sold in the London docks for about 2s. 9d. per cubic foot, at which price it should meet with a ready sale in this country.
Miraboo.—This is a strong and durable wood, with a pretty figure streaked with various shades of brown, and, as it takes a fine polish, it is well adapted for furniture and cabinet work. In grain it somewhat resembles teak, and as it is easily worked, and can be sold in this country with a good profit for 2s. 9d. per cubic foot, it is likely to become largely used as a substitute for that highly-prized wood for railway carriage work, while it could be advantageously employed instead of mahogany for superior descriptions of joiners' work.
Greeting.—This is an excellent wood for building constructions of all sorts, as well as for framing for railway rolling stock, agricultural machines, &c. It stands exposure well, and is easily worked. Like the two timbers last described, greeting can be imported into this country in squared logs or scantlings of useful sizes at about 2s. 9d. per cubic foot.
Russock.—This wood, which, when fresh sawn is of a light yellowish colour, but turns to reddish brown on exposure, is extensively used in the colony for builders' and joiners' work. The tree, which grows to an average height of 60 ft. without a branch, is often as large as 4 ft. in diameter, and can be used for many purposes for which mahogany is at present employed in this country; and, as it could be sold at the London Docks at 2s. 9d. per cubic foot, it compares very advantageously with mahogany in this respect.
Serayah (Selangan batu).—This wood, which is sometimes called "cedar," bears a strong resemblance to soft mahogany. It is a mild-working, straight-grained wood, and is suitable for joiners' work; and, as it can be sold in quantities in the London docks at 2s. per cubic foot, it ought to prove a serious rival to best yellow deal for building purposes in this country.
Time will not admit of any mention of the many varieties of fine Indian timbers which were submitted to trial; but I trust that the foregoing remarks may lead to a useful discussion of this vast subject, which I am sure will be much more interesting and instructive than the somewhat monotonous report which I have had the honour to read before you this evening.

STEALING TIMBER.—At the Thames Police-court, on Wednesday last, George Smith, 21, and Joshua Couch, 34, were charged with stealing a quantity of timber, value £2, the property of Jacob Singer, of 9, Greenfield Street, Whitechapel. They were further charged with assaulting the prosecutor. Singer stated that on Tuesday evening from what he was told he went to Settle Street, where he saw the prisoners and another man running away. There was a barrow standing near with a long plank of wood, 30ft. long, which belonged to witness, on it. Witness and another man stopped the prisoners, when Smith hit him in the eye, knocking him down. While on the ground, he was assaulted by both prisoners. The prisoners were each sentenced to three months' hard labour.
