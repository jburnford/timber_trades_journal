ARNOTT, ALEXANDER, builder, Russel
Road, Holloway, N. — This case has been
already reported, and the bankrupt, having
filed some additional accounts, passed his
public examination on Wednesday, before Mr.
Registrar Giffard. The liabilities amounted to
£5,533 4s. 10d., and the assets were returned
at £73 12s 9d. It appeared that the bankrupt
had incurred a liability of £5,000 on
mortgages as the nominee of Mr. H. A.
Astrup, of Finsbury Park.
ASTRUP, THOMAS, timber merchant,
58, Lombard Street, E.C.—The receiving order
in this case was made on January 4th, and ac-
counts filed by the debtor show liabilities to the
amount of £3,823 17s. 2d., and debts fully secured
£6,154 7s. 7d., against assets estimated at £404
0s. 1d., leaving a deficiency of £3,419 17s. 1d.
The debtor states that he commenced business
in 1875, in partnership with a Mr. T. Harland,
as “Astrup & Harland,” which partnership
was dissolved in April, 1880, when Mr. Harland
retired, and he (the debtor) took over the assets
and liabilities, none of which latter are now
outstanding. No balance-sheet was made out
at the time of the said dissolution, but in
December, 1880, his estate (including his
private property) showed a surplus of £2,559.
Further, that he has since carried on business
alone as a timber agent for certain firms in Norway and Sweden
mainly to his own account. He attributes his
liability for £1,400 16s. 3d. (see “other
liabilities” on sheet “D” in list below)
under a judgment obtained against him
(recently confirmed on appeal) in respect of a
claim for losses on certain shipments of timber
by another person in his (the debtor’s) name,
but without his knowledge or consent, has been

ported in the Timber Trades Journal. At
Truro Bankruptcy Court on Friday, bef
Mr. Bere, Q.C., Judge, Mr. Boase, solicitor,
St. Ives, applied to the Court to admit a pr

His Honour heard several witnesses in suppor
of the claim, and afterwards confirmed th
rejection with costs. Mr. W. J. Tirrell, Deputy
Official Receiver, supported the trustee’s
decision.
EDWARDS, CHAS. THOMAS, builder,
Morice Town, Devonport.—This failure has
been previously reported. The bankrupt
attended at the East Stonehouse Bankruptcy
Court on Tuesday for public examination.
Mr. G. Edmonds, Registrar, presided. Mr. H.
Greenway, Deputy Official Receiver, repre-
sented the estate, Mr. John Graves the debtor.
Mr. Greenway said he did not oppose debtor
passing, and the examination was accordingly
closed.
ELLIS, THOMAS, Junr., builder and
contractor, Doncaster.—On Thursday week
this debtor came up for his adjourned public
examination at the Sheffield Bankruptcy
Court, before Judge Ellison. Mr. Joseph
Binney represented the debtor, and the Official
Receiver conducted the examination, in reply
to whom the debtor stated that he had given
up the whole of his estate, and had not kept
anything back. The omnibus he had been in
the habit of running until recently belonged to
a Mrs. Moore, who had received the receipts
and paid him for driving the ‘bus. The Official
Receiver also questioned him as to some horses
he had in his possession at the time of the
bankruptcy, and which the debtor says are
somewhere in Doncaster, although he does not
know where. The Official Receiver stated in reply to Mr.
Binney that it was quite time he had a con-
siderable amount of money in hand from the
estate, but it appeared that the debtor had
done his best to prevent any estate coming to
the creditors. The examination was further
adjourned until March 10th.
FORD, HENRY, builder, Tisbury.—At the
Salisbury Bankruptcy Court on Friday, before
the Registrar (Mr. H. A. Wilson), Henry Ford
came up for his final examination. Mr. Pown-
ing, who represented Mr. Baker, trustee of the
estate, said the examination of this debtor was
adjourned from the last Court for the purpose
of the debtor giving particulars of a statement
that Mr. Knight, his brother-in-law, owed
him £320 8s. 7d. The Registrar asked if any
application had been made to Mr. Knight. Mr.
Powning said they were unable to do so, as Mr.
