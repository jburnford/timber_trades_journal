The indentations in the smoked portion made by the wards will show where to file.\nTEMPERING STEEL.—M. P. Gabriel gives the following method of tempering steel, in the Revue Chronometrique:—Cyanide of potassium is dissolved and red heated in a metallic or earthen crucible; the pieces of steel are then immersed in the liquid until red, and afterwards plunged in water. This process is said to give great satisfaction, and many advantages are claimed for it. The temper is said to be harder, and if a finished piece is under treatment the polish is not lost. It will show a greyish tint, but the original polish will reappear immediately if a piece of polished wood with the finest rouge is passed over it. It is also said that if the steel has been well annealed, and not put out of shape by the file or the hammer, it will come from the crucible perfectly straight; arbors 4 or 5 centimetres long are not deformed if tempered by this method. It is recommended as particularly advantageous for tempering escapement springs.\nMICHIGAN PINE TIMBER.—The stock of pine yet standing in Michigan, says the Chicago Current, can produce 40,000,000,000 ft. of lumber if cut for that purpose. In eight years, therefore, at average production of the state, the pine will have been used up. But such predictions have been made for years past. In 1867 the standing pine of Michigan was estimated to be 52,416,000,000 ft. and it was predicted that it would all be gone in seventeen years. But since then the Saginaw valley alone has produced about 12,000,000,000 ft., and will continue to cut in the neighbourhood of 1,000,000,000 ft. a year for eight or ten years to come. As pine grows scarce it will make more lumber than when it was plentiful. But in predicting the end of pine lumbering a person must take into account the timber which is yet standing in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Canada, and the South. And it will be many years before it even grows scarce, when we estimate the whole. Yet an end must come to the forests that the white race found in this country. Doubtless pine forests of the second growth will be raised for future use, but the present magnificent forests will disappear. It has been estimated that the demand for lumber in this country from 1880 to 1890 would require 210,000,000,000 ft., and one can readily see that at that rate the stock must soon be gone. There is only about 55,000,000,000 ft. of pine in Canada, and that would go but a short way in saving the forests of the United States.\n\nIMPORTS.\nENGLAND AND WALES.\n[For the purpose of economising space we abbreviate the names of importers when by so doing a line can be saved.
