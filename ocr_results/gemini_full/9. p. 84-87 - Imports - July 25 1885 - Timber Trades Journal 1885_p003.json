Sandison\n\nSTRIKES AND WAGES IN GERMANY.—Strikes and rumours of intended strikes are on the increase in Germany, and some of them relate to certain branches of labour that are somewhat new to the \"starvation\" wages that prevail in that country. Thus the linen weavers of Erdmansdorf, a village in Silesia, have ceased work in an attempt to secure an advance of about 20 per cent. on their wages, which average about a half a marks per week for ten hours' work per day, and seldom or never exceed twelve marks, equivalent to as many shillings.\n\nTHE Improved Wood Paving Company for the roadway of the upper part of Brett's Buildings, Holborn Circus, have paved with asphalte by the Val de Travers Company for the City Commissioners the incline it is the entrance to the street being so steep in order to give a foothold the road with wood it was necessary to pave the street being very narrow. The work was commenced on Monday by the Improved Wood Paving Company, of Queen Victoria Street, and the work was completed in the short time space of three days, being the quickest work ever in which the trades-men has been street paved, any street in the City, and it is expected while the annoyance will be but for a fortnight at the least. The Improved Wood Paving Company are also engaged in paving down Chapel Road and Wood in front the road-way of the London Hospital, White-chapel Road, with wood, and also in front of Street, of the Wood Green Hospital, and Turner Street, White-chapel, with wood, and in order to have a quiet paving, Little Britain is also being repaired with wood.\n\nRent, rates, taxes, and insurance amounted to £200 a year.\nJAMES CHAPMAN, timber merchant, of Grinstead and Brighton, was examined. His gross debts for eight years amounted to £37,000. He had a capital of £800. He had borrowed £1,000 from his brother who was a creditor for £1,200. The outstanding in his books was £2,000. He had suspended payment with liabilities of £2,600, and a private meeting of creditors was held on the 9th of May, when a statement of affairs was produced. His books were kept by single entry. He had had no cash book. He had had contracts and dealings with Mr. Ede. He became aware of his insolvency about a year, and had not since incurred any fresh debts. He prepared a statement of affairs himself. His stock about three weeks before his stoppage appeared he was solvent. The statement of affairs filed by the debtor showed liabilities to unsecured creditors £2,528 11s. 4d., creditors fully secured £2,528 11s. 4d., and creditors for securities £3,528 11s. 4d. The assets were contra £217 10s. 10d., and a deficiency of £1,000, less estimated loss on realisation, expected to rank for dividend £1,000.\nThe assets consist of stock-in-trade £1,200.",
