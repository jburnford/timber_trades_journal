Order\n\nSTRIKES AND WAGES IN GERMANY.—Strikes and rumours of intended strikes are on the increase in Germany, and some of the revelations as to the \"starvation\" wages that prevail in certain branches of labour are somewhat startling. Thus the linen weavers of Erdsmannsdorf, a village in Silesia, have ceased work in an attempt to secure an advance of about 20 per cent. on their wages, which average six and a half marks per week for twelve hours' work per day, and seldom or never exceed seven marks, equivalent to as many shillings.\nSTREET PAVING.—The roadway of the upper portion of Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn Circus, is now being paved by the Limmer Company for the Commissioners of Sewers, the street being closed for the horses, and the work was completed on Monday by the Improved Paving Company, of Queen Victoria Street, in the short space of three days, being the quickest time in which any street in the City has ever been paved, while the tradesmen in the street expected to be at least a fortnight at the annoyance. Whitechapel Road is also being laid down with wood the roadway in front of the London Hospital and Turner Street, Whitechapel, and also in front of the West Hackney Station, instead of macadam, and in order to have a quiet thoroughfare, the roadway is also being repaved with wood.\n\nTHE TIMBER TRADES JOURNAL. 87\nTHE GAZETTE.\nFAILURES AND ARRANGEMENTS.\n[It must not be overlooked that in many cases creditors whose names are published in these lists hold security for their debts, sometimes for the full amount.]\nGRIFFITH GRIFFITHS.—The debtor is a builder and contractor, 7, Lockyer Street, Plymouth, and recently traded with Charles Thomas Hulett, as Griffiths & Hulett, St. Mary Street Buildings, Cardiff.

There are no liabilities outstanding in respect of that partnership.
