Task: Correct a single OCR’d arrival line from The Timber Trades Journal “Imports of Timber, &c.”

Rules:
- Return exactly one corrected line.
- Use em dashes (—) as separators: arrival_place — departure_port — products [; merchants]
- Do not add or infer quantities; do not split into multiple lines.
- Keep phrasing verbatim where possible; only fix obvious OCR errors.
- Keep ports and place names as printed (light spelling fixes only, e.g., “Dantzic” ok).
- Keep parenthetical cargo notes; drop trivial (s) markers.
