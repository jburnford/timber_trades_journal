# 1883 London Timber Imports - Validation Results

## Dataset Overview

### Human Ground Truth
- **Source**: Manual transcription from Timber Trades Journal 1883
- **Scope**: London timber imports
- **Total records**: 4,993 cargo items (filtered to 1883 only)
- **Fields**: date, origin_port, quantity, unit, product
- **Note**: Original dataset contained 5,400 records including some 1882 and 1889 data (human transcription error)

### Automated OCR Data
- **Source**: Gemini OCR + automated parsing pipeline
- **Scope**: London timber imports from 1883 TTJ issues
- **Total records**: 2,529 cargo items
- **Date coverage**: 51 unique dates (16.9% of human's 261 dates)
- **Hybrid dates**:
  - 1,238 using arrival dates (48.9%)
  - 1,291 using publication dates (51.1%)

## Matching Strategy

### Algorithm
- **Primary key**: Date (±14 day window) + Origin Port + Commodity
- **Fuzzy matching**: SequenceMatcher for port and commodity names
- **Thresholds**:
  - Port similarity: 85%
  - Commodity similarity: 80%
  - Date window: ±14 days

### Critical Fix
Initial matching had a bug where `hybrid_arrival_date` was incorrectly calculated, using publication dates even when arrival dates existed. This was fixed by properly prioritizing arrival dates over publication dates.

**Impact of fix**:
- Unique dates increased from 40 to 51
- Matches increased from 360 to 1,769

## Matching Results

### Overall Performance
- **Total matches**: 1,769 / 2,529 automated records
- **Precision**: 69.9% (automated records successfully matched)
- **Recall**: 35.4% (human records successfully matched)
- **F1 Score**: 47.0

### Match Types
- **1:1 matches**: 626 (35.4%)
- **1:many matches**: 1,143 (64.6%)
  - Automated record matched multiple human records
  - Best match selected by combined port+commodity score
- **Unmatched automated**: 760 (30.1%)
- **Unmatched human**: 3,940 (78.9%)

### Low recall explanation
The 35.4% recall is primarily due to **incomplete OCR coverage**:
- Human data spans 261 unique dates
- Automated data covers only 51 unique dates
- Date overlap: 44 dates (16.9% of human dates)
- Missing dates account for 4,168 human records (83.5%)

Most missing human dates are Mondays/Tuesdays, suggesting certain TTJ issues weren't OCR'd yet.

## Field-Level Accuracy

### Date Matching
- **Exact date matches (0 days)**: 105 (5.9%)
- **Within ±1 day**: 212 (12.0%)
- **Within ±3 days**: 386 (21.8%)
- **Within ±7 days**: 948 (53.6%)
- **Within ±14 days**: 1,769 (100%)
- **Mean date difference**: 7.0 days
- **Median date difference**: 7 days

### Port Matching
- **Perfect matches (1.0 score)**: 1,663 (94.0%)
- **Mean similarity**: 0.994
- **Analysis**: Excellent accuracy, fuzzy matching handles historical spelling variants well

### Commodity Matching
- **Perfect matches (1.0 score)**: 1,646 (93.0%)
- **Mean similarity**: 0.992
- **Analysis**: High accuracy despite variations like "deal" vs "deals"

### Unit Matching
- **Exact**: 845 (53.1%)
- **Similar**: 700 (44.0%) - e.g., "t." vs "tons"
- **Different**: 45 (2.8%)
- **Total exact/similar**: 97.2%

### Quantity Matching
- **Exact matches**: 664 (37.6%)
- **Within 10%**: 119 (6.7%)
- **Total within 10%**: 783 (44.3%)
- **>10% difference**: 984 (55.7%)
- **Mean difference (non-exact)**: 55.2%
- **Median difference (non-exact)**: 59.2%
- **Missing data**: 2 records

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **High port accuracy (94% perfect)**: Demonstrates strong OCR + normalization performance
2. **High commodity accuracy (93% perfect)**: Successful parsing of cargo descriptions
3. **Good unit matching (97% exact/similar)**: Correct extraction of measurement units
4. **Moderate quantity exact matches (38%)**: Reasonable for OCR of historical documents

### Challenges
1. **Large quantity discrepancies (56% >10% difference)**: Suggests either:
   - OCR errors in numbers (e.g., 9 vs 93, 624 vs 54)
   - Different cargo aggregation approaches
   - Human transcription errors
2. **Incomplete date coverage (17%)**: Many TTJ issues not yet OCR'd
3. **1:many matches (65%)**: Multiple human records per automated record may indicate:
   - Different granularity of cargo recording
   - Ambiguous matching within date window

### Sample Matches

#### Perfect matches (all fields exact):
```
Date: 1883-01-01 vs 1883-01-02 (1 day diff)
Port: Uddevalla vs Uddevalla (score: 1.0)
Commodity: trellis vs trellis (score: 1.0)
Quantity: 13 crts vs 13 crts.
```

#### Large quantity discrepancies:
```
Date: 1883-01-01 vs 1883-01-02 (1 day diff)
Port: New York vs New York (score: 1.0)
Commodity: ash squares vs ash squares (score: 1.0)
Quantity: 9 bdls vs 93 n.s. (90% difference)
```

## Conclusions

### Overall Assessment
The validation demonstrates **strong automated performance on categorical fields** (ports, commodities, units) with **moderate performance on quantities**. The 70% precision and 35% recall provide a solid foundation for:
1. Comparing automated vs manual transcription methods
2. Estimating error rates in automated pipeline
3. Identifying areas for improvement (especially quantity OCR)

### Data Quality Note
Human transcription also contains errors, including:
- Small amount of 1889 data in 1883 tab
- Possible quantity transcription errors contributing to discrepancies

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Investigate quantity discrepancies**: Manual review of cases with >50% difference
2. **Complete 1883 OCR**: Process remaining TTJ issues to improve recall
3. **Validate 1889 data**: Use as second ground truth (no quantities, but more complete)
4. **Error taxonomy**: Categorize mismatch types for systematic improvements
